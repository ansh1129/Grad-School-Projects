Criador da Dell fecha capital para proteger seu legado,"Feb. 6, 2013 12:03 a.m. ET","By Ben Worthen e Anupreeta DaFeb. 6, 2013 12:03 a.m. ETA operação de fechamento de capital da fabricante de computadores americana Dell Inc., confirmada pela empresa ontem, pode ser um reconhecimento de que seu fundador e diretor-presidente, Michael Dell, não foi capaz de colocar em prática as mudanças necessárias para melhorar a receita e o lucro da empresa diante das críticas de Wall Street.A empresa anunciou que aceitou o fechamento de capital, uma operação de US$ 24,4 bilhões, conduzido por um grupo liderado por Michael Dell que inclui a gigante de software Microsoft Inc., a firma de private-equity Silver Lake Partners e um punhado de bancos de investimento. Eles oferecerão aos acionistas US$ 13,65 por ação, o que significa um prêmio de 25% em relação ao preço negociado no mês passado, após a negociação ter se tornado pública.O fechamento de capital ainda precisa ser aprovado pelos acionistas minoritários.A transação será financiada através de uma combinação de dinheiro e ações de Dell, dinheiro de fundos de investimento filiados à Silver Lake, da MSD Capital LP, um empréstimo de US$ 2 bilhões da Microsoft, rolagem de dívida existente, bem como financiamento de dívida pelos bancos Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays , Credit Suisse e RBC Capital Markets, além de dinheiro já em caixa.Michael Dell BLOOMBERG NEWSO acordo de fusão prevê um período inicial de 45 dias, durante o qual a Dell pode ativamente solicitar propostas alternativas. O acordo deve dar a Michael Dell participação majoritária na empresa, garantindo que o executivo de 47 anos estará no comando de qualquer mudança.Nos últimos anos, Michael Dell teve de tolerar duras comparações sobre o desempenho financeiro da sua empresa com a Apple Inc., o que lhe causou particular frustração, de acordo com pessoas familiares com a questão.Entrevistas com ex e atuais executivos da Dell, além de outras pessoas que conhecem o executivo, permitiram elaborar um retrato de um homem que parecia estar cada vez mais preocupado com relação ao seu legado. Essas pessoas disseram que há anos ele não mostrava o entusiasmo de quando ele recuperou o título de diretor-presidente, em 2007, depois de um curto período em que atuou apenas como presidente do conselho da empresa.Michael Dell não respondeu ao pedido de entrevista e um porta-voz não quis comentar.A operação de fechamento de capital tem muito mais a ver com o empresário Dell do que com a empresa fundada por ele em 1984, em seu alojamento na Universidade do Texas. ""É bastante simples: seu nome está na porta"", disse um ex-executivo da companhia sobre Michael Dell.Quando ele voltou para o comando executivo em janeiro de 2007, prometeu reposicionar a Dell para a nova era.Michael Dell contratou vários novos executivos, inclusive novos líderes para as áreas de operações, marketing e de produtos ao consumidor. Mas embora as vendas tenham aumentado durante o primeiro ano do seu retorno, ele não conseguiu manter o ritmo. Os chefes de marketing e operações saíram menos de dois anos depois de terem assumido o cargo. O executivo responsável pela área de consumo deixou a empresa em 2010, após tentativas frustradas no mercado de reprodutores de música, smartphones e laptops avançados.Michael Dell começou a reduzir sua exposição pública. Em 2011, ele deixou de fazer apresentações nas teleconferências de resultado da empresa, deixando a missão para seu diretor financeiro e outros líderes da companhia.Michael Dell ainda controla as revisões operacionais, dizem pessoas que participam dos encontros, e às vezes ele parecia se concentrar mais em minúcias do que em grandes decisões estratégicas. Muitos anos atrás, Dell escreveu um memorando de quatro páginas depois de ter usado pela primeira vez o XPS One, um computador de mesa avançado que incluía todas as suas partes no interior do monitor. Suas observações, enviadas tarde da noite, no dia em que ele recebeu o equipamento, incluíam opiniões até sobre o isopor usado para embalar o computador.No fim de 2010, Michael Dell tinha abandonado em grande parte seus esforços para desenvolver produtos para consumidores e defendeu uma nova trajetória para tornar a Dell uma empresa de serviços completos para clientes corporativos. Ele gastou milhões para comprar fabricantes de software de segurança, de sistema de armazenamento e outros produtos, com um olho em reinventar a própria empresa como uma International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) de menor porte.Os produtos corporativos têm margens maiores do que os computadores pessoais, mas até agora não têm sido capazes de compensar a queda no negócio de PCs, que ainda responde por metade do faturamento anual da Dell, de US$ 62 bilhões. No geral, as vendas de PCs da empresa recuaram 13% nos primeiros três trimestres do ano fiscal de 2013. O faturamento total caiu 7% no período.Apesar de Michael Dell não ter anunciado o que faria com uma Dell de capital fechado, analistas dizem que agora a empresa tem tudo o que precisa para se tornar uma provedora de serviços completos para clientes corporativos. Mas ele precisa fazer essas partes funcionarem juntas, tanto no aspecto tecnológico quanto no organizacional.Uma Dell de capital fechado pode focar nisso e provavelmente deixar alguns segmentos do mercado de PCs que oferecem baixas margens, como vendas no varejo para o consumidor, disse.Mas o acordo indica provavelmente que a Dell não vai abandonar o negócio de PC completamente. Nas negociações, a Microsoft pediu uma garantia de que a grande maioria dos aparelhos com a marca Dell rodem o Windows, disse uma pessoa a par do assunto.O enfraquecimento do mercado de PCs também representa um desafio para a Microsoft, cujo sistema operacional Windows está na maioria dos PCs do mundo, mas não conseguiu ganhar muito terreno em outros tipos de aparelhos. O investimento na Dell poderia ajudar a estabilizar um dos principais distribuidores da gigante de software e garantir que a Microsoft tenha um canal importante para o Windows.Na verdade, o próprio Michael Dell parece ter uma posição definida com relação aos PCs. Quando, em 2011, a Hewlett-Packard considerou brevemente ampliar seu negócio de PCs, em conversas privadas ele zombou da idéia como um grande erro.(Colaboraram Ian Sherr e Don Clark.)"

Computer Sales in Free Fall,"Updated April 11, 2013 8:38 a.m. ET","An employee at an Electric Avenue store in Miami shows a Dell computer to potential buyers. GETTY IMAGESBy Ian Sherr And Shira OvideUpdated April 11, 2013 8:38 a.m. ETThe personal computer is in crisis, and getting little help from Microsoft Corp.'s MSFT -3.01% Windows 8 software once seen as a possible savior.PC Sales in Free Fall; Now What?What's next for the personal-computer industry, following startling numbers showing a sharp decline in new sales? Spencer Ante joins Markets Hub.Research firm IDC issued an alarming report Wednesday for PC makers such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ -3.56% , saying world-wide shipments of laptops and desktops fell 14% in the first quarter from a year earlier. That is the sharpest drop since IDC began tracking this data in 1994 and marks the fourth straight quarter of declines.Gartner Inc., IT -1.33% a rival research firm, estimated global shipments sank 11.2%, which it called the worst drop since the first quarter of 2001. Gartner blamed the rise of tablets and smartphones, which are sapping demand for personal computers.PC Shipments Dive Despite Advent of Windows 8Shipments of personal computers have plummeted in spite of Microsoft's introduction of Windows 8 – which was designed to make PCs appear more like tablets. As improvements in PC technology become more incremental, consumers are increasingly gravitating toward mobile devices.Microsoft, whose software is on a majority of the world's PCs, last fall introduced Windows 8, a completely overhauled operating system with touch-screen capabilities.But there is little sign that buyers are responding. In a surprisingly harsh assessment, IDC said Windows 8 hasn't only failed to spur more PC demand but has actually exacerbated the slowdown—confusing consumers with features that don't excel in a tablet mode and compromise the traditional PC experience.Shoppers at a Best Buy store in Orem, Utah, check out laptops running Microsoft's Windows 8. BLOOMBERGMOREHeard: Microsoft Can't Keep Up in a Mobile WorldMicrosoft Plans 7-Inch TabletRELATED VIDEOBlack Friday-Style Deals as PC Sales PlungeAs sales of personal computers spiral down toward typewriter-level numbers, manufacturers are scrambling while those looking to buy a PC have reason to cheer. (Photo: Getty Images)""The reaction to Windows 8 is real,"" said Jay Chou, an IDC analyst, about the negative sentiment.""The PC market is evolving and highly dynamic,"" a Microsoft spokeswoman said. ""Along with our partners we continue to bring even more innovation to market across tablets and PCs.""Mr. Chou said not only has Windows 8 failed to attract consumers, but businesses are keeping their distance as well. Chief information officers at several companies echoed his opinion Wednesday.Ricoh Americas Corp., which replaces about a third of its 17,000 PCs every three years and upgrades to the most current operating system available, said this year it is sticking with Windows 7, released in 2009. Tracey Rothenberger, the company's chief operating officer, said the benefits of switching to the new software aren't worth the effort of training employees to use it.""I don't think there's anything wrong with [Windows 8],"" said Mr. Rothenberger. ""But I think there's minimal value in the incremental changes that are there.""Microsoft executives have said Windows 8 would take many months to catch on with consumers and especially with businesses that generate the majority of the company's profits.Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst at Gartner, wasn't so quick to blame Microsoft for the industry's woes, arguing instead that secular trends such as customer interest in touch-based mobile devices beyond PCs are playing a larger role.""Windows 8 is the right direction,"" Ms. Kitagawa said. ""It will be a while before Windows 8 is adopted.""H-P, the world's largest PC maker, showed the steepest drop in global shipments in the quarter with a 24% decline, according to IDC. Dell, ranked fourth in world-wide shipments, posted a 11% drop as it makes headlines for grim financial troubles and efforts to take the company private.Even Apple Inc., AAPL -0.66% whose products ignited consumer interest in mobile devices, may not be immune to the troubles. U.S. shipments pegged it as the third largest PC maker, though its results fell 7.5%, IDC said. By contrast, Gartner said Apple's U.S. computer shipments rose 7.4% from the previous year.The first quarter's declines come after a particularly troubling run up to last year's holiday quarter, during which industry researchers began sounding alarm bells that the PC market would post its first annual contraction in more than a decade. Meanwhile, tablets like Apple's iPad flew off the shelves.Many computer-industry executives hoped Windows 8 would spark a revival in their PC and tablet sales. PC makers have mounted a series of responses to the iPad, shipping an array of computers with new looks including portables that convert from tablet mode to a clamshell design with a built-in keyboard.Microsoft executives have said to make Windows 8 computing devices more appealing, they are urging a wider variety of touch-screen computers and tablets at a broader range of prices than were available over the holiday season.But consumers don't appear to be responding and now analysts are expecting PC sales to suffer at least through the first half of 2013.Carrie Soukup, a 32-year old tech support contractor living in Austin, Texas, is among the skeptics about the new software.As she has been researching a new laptop she plans to purchase this year, she said a PC running Windows 7 was more appealing than the newer designs. ""I'm not entirely thrilled with Windows 8,"" she said. ""There's a lot of show I don't see the functionality in.""Other consumers, like Gene Elmer Munson, have held off buying PCs all together as they increasingly rely on mobile gadgets.Mr. Munson, a 40-year-old human resources-and-finance worker, has a desktop, a laptop and a smartphone and 7-inch tablet powered by Google Inc.'s Android software.He bought the 7-inch Google Nexus tablet in December, and now finds himself using his laptop less and his tablet more, especially for personal work, including the novels he writes in his spare time.""If I didn't have a smartphone and a tablet I would have replaced it by now,"" said Mr. Munson of his H-P laptop. ""I don't see myself buying a laptop in the foreseeable future.""Roughly 350 million personal computers are sold each year, but combined sales of smartphones and tablets are dwarfing those PC figures.People are expected to buy about 919 million smartphones this year, and IDC expects nearly 200 million tablets will be sold this year.In another blow to Microsoft particularly, sales of tablets powered Windows 8 also haven't been strong. Windows 8 accounted for only 1% of global tablet shipments in 2012, with its share expected to rise to 7.4% by 2017, IDC says.Stephen Baker, an analyst at NPD Group, said the future for Windows-based machines is looking increasingly bleak. ""In a PC form factor you won't see Windows 8 with touch have any impact,"" he said.Meanwhile, few businesses are buying many more PCs, and when they are, they aren't buying them with Windows 8—at least not yet.Some corporate chief information officers say they don't see a compelling reason to upgrade to Windows 8.Barry Libenson, chief information officer of Land O'Lakes Inc., manages a fleet of around 7,000 PCs, and says the number ""is increasing annually, but not by a significant amount.""His company, on a three-year refresh cycle, runs the PCs on Windows 7 and doesn't have plans to migrate to Windows 8 until either the performance of Windows 7 deteriorates, or if a licensing deal with Microsoft were to make cost a nonissue.Windows 8 ""will not be a driver for increased adoption"" of PCs, he said.IDC said companies have also begun extending the life of their computers. The firm noted many companies that used to buy new PCs every three years before the recession have pushed out their purchases to every four or five years these days.The market's troubles have been exaggerated by the dramatic corporate changes at H-P and Dell, which IDC said magnified negative trends. Rival Lenovo Group Ltd., by comparison, has been able to maintain its shipments worldwide, and actually increased its results in the U.S.IDC said the market's steeper-than-expected contraction may spur the firm to revise its worldwide shipment expectations even lower than the gloomy outlook of a 1.3% contraction for the year. IDC's data doesn't include shipments of iPads or any computers whose screens can be detached from their keyboards. Gartner said some hybrid laptops are included, but they still represent very small numbers.—Clint Boultonand Michael Hickins contributed to this article.Write to Ian Sherr at ian.sherr@dowjones.com"
New Worry for Bondholders: LBOs,"Updated Feb. 3, 2013 7:10 p.m. ET","By Patrick McGee and Matt WirzUpdated Feb. 3, 2013 7:10 p.m. ETCorporate-bond investors are facing a new threat: private-equity firms launching debt-laden takeovers of companies in their portfolios.With buyouts back in vogue, fund managers specializing in highly rated, or investment-grade, bonds have been scrambling to avoid companies that might fall prey to private equity.Drilling floor of a Nabors oil rig. BLOOMBERG NEWSWhen private-equity firms purchase a company in a ""leveraged buyout,"" or LBO, they stuff it with debt to reduce the cash they have to use in the takeover. The debt burden, in turn, can lead to a downgrade of the company's bonds, sending their price lower and causing losses in investors' portfolios. Some bond investors cut their exposure to target companies at the mere suggestion of a buyout.The most recent, and high-profile, example of the trend came when Dell Inc.'s longer-term bonds lost as much as 17% of their value shortly after reports emerged last month of a potential $23 billion buyout of the computer maker. The bonds now trade 14% lower than they did before the deal surfaced.That sent a wake-up call to bond-fund managers.As perceptions of buyout risk grew in January, Eaton Vance took a hard look at its $5.7 billion of investment-grade bonds and cut exposure to possible leveraged-buyout targets whose debt it perceived as overvalued, such as oil servicer Nabors Industries Ltd. , said Kathleen Gaffney, a co-director at the firm. ""We cleared the decks,"" she said.""The risks of leveraging activity have increased,"" said Scott Kimball, portfolio manager of the BMO TCH Corporate Income Fund, which holds $200 million of assets. Mr. Kimball said he screens for companies that have the potential to be acquired, and he will only purchase the bonds if there is a bond covenant, such as a ""change-of-control"" option that protects bondholders in the case of a buyout. Roughly one-third of bonds of nonfinancial companies have such change-of-control provisions, according to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.In recent years, bond investors have been mostly shielded from the risks of buyouts.LBO activity in the past three years has averaged just $80 billion annually, versus the $405 billion average in the peak years of 2006 and 2007, according to J.P. Morgan. The average size of an LBO has been about $1 billion since the financial crisis of 2008-09, compared with $1.7 billion in the peak years, according to S&P Capital IQ LCD.But in the past few months, the potential for large buyouts has increased as low interest rates have coincided with shrinking macroeconomic risks. The European Central Bank's pledge to keep the euro together and the resolution of the U.S. presidential election and fiscal-cliff debate have reduced market uncertainty to a point where ""private-equity firms would have the confidence to pull the trigger on LBO transactions,"" according to Hans Mikkelsen, a credit strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.When Mr. Mikkelsen began warning investment-grade-bond investors of the risk in general of a $20 billion leveraged buyout in November, reactions were muted. But in the wake of Dell's deal talks, he says he has been flooded with calls from investors trying to handicap the chances of other megadeals.Bonds from other likely LBO targets—cash-rich companies with depressed share prices and other criteria favorable to private buyers—also have fallen in value.Leader Capital Corp. portfolio manager Scott Carmack noticed unusual selling in bonds of telecommunications provider CenturyLink Inc. and Nabors when talk of the Dell deal leaked. CenturyLink's bond due 2022 dropped to $104.5 from $106.2 within a week, while Nabors's bond due 2021 fell to $102.7 from $107.5 within three weeks, according to electronic-trading platform MarketAxess.""We don't comment on rumors or speculation,"" said Debra Peterson, a spokeswoman for CenturyLink. Nabors didn't respond to a request for comment.Wall Street firms have begun recommending that bond investors offset buyout risk through credit-default swaps—insurance-like contracts that are designed to protect against a company's default. Credit Suisse Group AG published a report last week recommending the swaps of several buyout candidates, including retailer Staples Inc., food manufacturer Hillshire Brands Co. and information-technology company Computer Sciences Corp. A spokesman for Hillshire declined to comment, and Staples and Computer Sciences didn't respond to requests for comment.Many fund managers prefer avoiding bonds with buyout risk.Jesse Fogarty, portfolio manager at Cutwater Asset Management, said he is on guard against any kind of shareholder-friendly activity, such as a takeover or increases in dividend payments, that might hurt the position of bondholders. ""A perfect storm is developing, with pressure on company management to deliver higher stock returns after a pretty lousy 10-year run,"" he said.One area Mr. Fogarty likes is bank bonds. Banks aren't considered likely buyout candidates, and tougher new rules limit their ability to increase dividends and take risks with balance sheets. Mr. Fogarty is so bullish on the sector that he buys subordinated bank debt, which offers a higher yield to compensate for greater default risk owing to their subordination to senior debtholders.Other investors say the LBO tremors are creating opportunities to buy bonds on the cheap.Mr. Carmack, who co-manages $397 million at Portland-based Leader, said he wasn't interested in three-year Dell bonds when they traded around $103, yielding 1%. But in the aftermath of the buyout rumors bond prices sank below $99 and yields jumped to 2.80%, so he picked them up for his short-term bond fund.If Dell doesn't go private, the likelihood of these bonds jumping in value is strong, because the company wouldn't need to take on big debts. Even if there is an LBO, Mr. Carmack is betting the bonds will be downgraded only to a low-investment-grade rating in the triple-B range from single-A.Write to Patrick McGee at patrick.mcgee@dowjones.com and Matt Wirz at matthieu.wirz@wsj.com"

Mind Mapping Streamlines a Business Negotiation,"April 25, 2013 9:18 a.m. ET","By Zack AnchorsApril 25, 2013 9:18 a.m. ETThe breakup of long-time business partners can be one of the most complicated and emotionally charged situations for a financial adviser to handle. It's even more difficult when the partners are also family members.That was the challenge facing adviser Rob O'Dell of Wheaton Wealth Partners in 2010, when a client asked for help negotiating the sale of his shares in the family business. Mr. O'Dell's client was in his early 60s, and together with his younger brother had owned a retail business worth roughly $5 million, plus real-estate assets, for several years. The younger brother now wanted to take complete ownership so he could pass the business on to his children.RELATED VIDEOThis Retirement Plan Could Replace 401(k)sRetirement planning revolves around 401(k)s and defined benefit plans. But something called a cash balance pension plan could become as popular as 401(k) plans within the next few years. MarketWatch's Jim Jelter explains why. (Photo: Getty Images)MORE FROM WEALTH MANAGEMENTAn Alternative Approach to Market TimingAdvisers Find New Estate-Tax StrategyVisit the new Wealth Management sectionThe negotiation had descended into a dispute over which brother had been more responsible for the success of the business and how to fairly split business assets. That conflict was causing a rift within the extended family.""It was an ugly business divorce with a lot of moving parts,"" says Mr. O'Dell, whose firm manages $135 million for 71 clients through offices in Wheaton, Ill., and Naples, Fla. ""There were other siblings involved who didn't have ownership in the business, there was real estate, there were family dynamics and some complicated business finances.""GETTY IMAGESThose complexities led Mr. O'Dell to a solution that changed his entire approach to financial advising. What was needed, Mr. O'Dell realized, was a way for each brother to see the situation from the other's perspective. And Mr. O'Dell had a method to literally make that happen: Mind mapping.Mind mapping is a technique for diagramming complex information. A mind map starts with a central idea, from which related ideas or sets of information are linked in separate branches. Mr. O'Dell had been using mind-mapping software to help manage his firm, but the ""business divorce"" seemed like a perfect opportunity to try using it with clients.""We told my client it was experiment and he was OK with that,"" says Mr. O'Dell. ""So we started mapping out his situation.""The brothers came to a meeting in Mr. O'Dell's office, where he created a mind map with the family business in the center. He displayed this image on a 55-inch HD monitor, allowing the client and his brother to watch as they populated the branches of that map with the network of interests, assets and liabilities connected to the business. For example, one branch represented the family's commercial real-estate holdings, from which extended smaller branches that listed information such as property taxes, valuation and management costs.The brothers entered the negotiation with a competitive attitude, believing they had to fight for what they deserved. But the process of creating the mind map required participation and collaboration, rather than confrontation. As the adviser asked questions about the business and they watched the screen fill with branches, the conflict over who had contributed a greater share to the business began to seem less relevant.""They could see that there was a lot of overlap, and then everything became much clearer and easier to work with than it would have been with a traditional negotiation,"" says Mr. O'Dell.The experience was valuable for all parties: The brothers ended up reaching a compromise on the business split, and Mr. O'Dell saw how mind mapping could help clients understand complex financial situations. He now uses the technique with all of his clients.""We originally thought it'd just be a great tool for running the business,"" says Mr. O'Dell. ""But it offers us a way to differentiate ourselves and provide clients with a more active financial-planning experience."""
Apple Has an Identity Crisis,"Updated April 22, 2013 8:30 p.m. ET","Apple Faces Identity CrisisAs the company prepares to report earnings Tuesday after grappling with a stock plunge, the company must prove that it is not just a hardware business but a software one too. Jessica Lessin reports on The News Hub.By Jessica E. LessinUpdated April 22, 2013 8:30 p.m. ETApple Inc. AAPL -0.66% is facing an identity crisis on Wall Street.As Apple prepares to report what analysts project may be the company's first year-over-year quarterly earnings decline in a decade on Tuesday, it is also grappling with jittery investors and a recent share-price plunge that has wiped about $280 billion off its market capitalization since its stock reached a high of $702.10 last September.Much of the investor nervousness is rooted in how Wall Street is treating and valuing the Cupertino, Calif., company as a traditional hardware maker. One camp of analysts and some investors said there is strong evidence that Apple should be viewed in a different light: as a software-hardware hybrid.REUTERSThe distinction matters. If it continues to be seen as a hardware business, Apple's streak—driven by products like the iPhone and iPad—could run out quickly as smartphones and tablets get commoditized and consumer tastes change. It is a lesson learned by companies like BlackBerry-maker Research In Motion Ltd. , whose tech hardware was quickly eclipsed by products from Apple itself.If Apple is classified as a software-hardware hybrid, the company could be valued more like Internet and software makers that have recurring revenue streams and that often trade at higher price-to-earnings ratios than hardware firms.""The market views Apple as a consumer hardware company tied to product cycles that drive volatile revenue and earnings streams,"" says Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty. But that view isn't complete, she says, since ""Apple customers buy into a brand that offers ease of use similar to companies like Amazon.com or enterprise companies like NetApp.""An Apple spokesman declined to comment ahead of Tuesday's earning report.With Wall Street categorizing Apple as a hardware maker, investors value the company—which made an astounding $13 billion in profits in the quarter ended in December—at 8.6 times expected earnings per share for the next 12 months. Investors are currently valuing Hewlett-Packard Co. , which made $1.2 billion in profits during its most recent quarter, at a price-to-earnings ratio of 5.6. Troubled PC maker Dell Inc., whose stock price inflated after signing a buyout deal earlier this year, trades at a P/E ratio of 8.5.MOREApple Wins Ruling in Google Patent CaseApple's gross margins are around 40%, an important measure of the company's efficiency at making money. That is roughly twice as high as H-P's and Dell's.Apple has characteristics that differ from many other hardware businesses. Its customers often upgrade their Apple products annually, far more frequently than the four-year PC upgrade cycles typically found at tech hardware businesses including Hewlett-Packard or Dell.While H-P and Dell have tried beefing up the enterprise software side of their business, Apple's operating system and iTunes software is already ubiquitous. Apple also has more than 500 million accounts for its App Store tied to credit cards—and a customer base to sell new services to—giving it a recurring software and services revenue stream. Apple took in revenue of $3.7 billion from iTunes and other software and services in its last quarter, or 7% of its total revenue.That gives Apple at least some properties of enterprise software companies like storage hardware and services company EMC Corp. , which has a P/E ratio of 11.4. Some analysts are urging a comparison to cable companies like Comcast Corp. , which also enjoys steady revenue from subscriptions. That company has a P/E ratio of 16.4.At Apple, Chief Executive Tim Cook has been lobbying Wall Street to change its hardware-centric views.Even if Wall Street shifts its view on Apple as a software-hardware hybrid, the firm's woes aren't over. REUTERSAt an investor conference in February, Mr. Cook said ""because we're not a hardware company, we have other ways to make money and reward shareholders."" He added that unlike other hardware businesses, ""we don't look at the sale of a product as our last part of the relationship with the customer. It's the first.""Even if Wall Street shifts its view on Apple as a software-hardware hybrid, however, the company's woes aren't over. The history of hardware companies that stayed on top through software is short. Sony Corp. , for instance, lost its supremacy to Apple when the Walkman couldn't compete with iTunes and the iPod. RIM enjoyed huge sales spurred by its email service, only to have that eclipsed by Apple and its App Store.Now, some say there are signs Google Inc. may do the same to Apple with online services. Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster says Apple builds great software, but gets a ""C"" on software services like data syncing service iCloud.And while customer loyalty to Apple remains high with 80% to 90% of U.S. iPhone users saying their next phone will be an iPhone, the clock is ticking, Mr. Munster says. ""People love their Apple products and want to buy them but they have six months. There has to be something cool coming.""Many analysts believe Apple's next big software play will be payments—a sticky service that could keep users buying Apple products in the same way iTunes and the App Store have. Still, that could take years to reach fruition and Apple faces pressure to boost profits now.For the second fiscal quarter, analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect the company to report 8% revenue growth to $42.3 billion in the quarter. Apple's earnings are projected to be $9.5 billion, down from $11.6 billion a year earlier.Write to Jessica E. Lessin at jessica.lessin@wsj.com"

Does Sponsored Content Work for Advertisers?,"Mar 23, 2014 6:27 pm ET","By Jack MarshallMar 23, 2014 6:27 pm ET0 COMMENTSSponsored content is one of the marketing world’s favorite new trends. Only problem is, no one is yet sure how effective it actually is.Advertisers are increasingly paying to have their messaging closely integrated with editorial content on publisher sites in the hope consumers will find it more appealing than other online ad formats such as banners.But understanding return on investment from sponsored content isn’t straight-forward because the tactic is so new, and because it’s vastly different to other ad formats.“Clients are still figuring out how to measure it,” said Sebastien Tomich, Vice President of advertising at the New York Times. “It’s just totally new and different. There’s no standard for what has been successful and what has not,” he explained.The Times is one of a number of publishers, also including The Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post and newer online venture Quartz that are now selling various versions of sponsored content, or “native advertising” as it’s often referred to.Early data on reader response to sponsored content highlights the questions. According to real-time analytics firm Chartbeat, readers behave far differently with sponsored content than they do with publishers’ regular editorial content. The company’s data suggests that two-thirds of readers spend over 15 seconds with editorial content, on average. By contrast, only one third of readers spend that long on sponsored article pages.Just because a consumer clicks on a piece of branded content, they don’t necessarily read it, says Chartbeat CEO Tony Haile.For most marketers, their early forays into sponsored content have largely been designed to test and to learn. Part of that process is figuring out what metrics are important to their individual campaigns, and ultimately to their business. There’s no “one size fits all” solution, marketers and publishers say.“Marketers definitely are experimenting with this,” said Joy Robins Vice President of Advertising and Strategy at Quartz, an online publication owned by Atlantic Media Co. “There’s no question people are becoming a lot smarter, but they’re still trying to figure out the value of things like social shares,” she added.That goes for publishers, too. They’re still looking for ways to prove the ads they’re selling actually work, especially if they hope to attract repeat buys. That means reporting all sorts of metrics ranging from pageviews, to the average time spent on a page, to information on the types of consumers that clicked on their articles.“A lot of publishers are facing this as a challenge right now; how do they tell a marketer that a campaign was effective?” said Kunal Gupta, CEO of native ad technology company Polar. “It’s a messy world right now,” he added.The Wall Street Journal’s global head of advertising sales, Trevor Fellows, said consumption metrics are key for measuring sponsored content, but it’s not just about hard numbers. “A huge measure of our success is the ability to work collaboratively with brands and their advertising agencies, to identify and then articulate their story,” he said.The Journal, the Times, the Post, and Quartz all make clear their sponsored content is created without the involvement of their editorial departments.Some marketers say they’re beginning to develop an understanding of what works for them. Dell, for example, was the inaugural advertiser for the New York Times’ paid posts program in January. Its paid posts were part of its “beginnings” campaign, and were designed to appeal to those interested in themes such as entrepreneurship and technology. The computer company said it went into that campaign with specific metrics it wanted to track, such as the amount of time readers spent with its content, how many of them shared it across social networks, and how many clicked through to visit its own site.“It’s not as easy to tie a sponsored article to a purchase, but that’s not really the goal,” said Dell’s Managing Editor, Stephanie Losee, who oversaw the campaign. “This content is at the top of the [purchase] funnel; it’s intended to cast a wide net for those interested in these topics and to put Dell in front of them… It’s at the awareness level.”Ms. Losee added that part of the reason Dell worked with the Times for that campaign was for the public relations value associated with being the first brand to do so. Other marketers working with the publisher for their campaigns would likely have different goals, she said.In order to establish those goals, and to figure out how to reach them, publishers say it’s imperative to have a close relationship and ongoing dialogue with clients. But Mr. Haile says some marketers are still incorrectly looking at simple metrics such a pageviews instead of more important ones like engagement and social media activity.“It’s not that native advertising doesn’t work. Some works extremely well, it’s just incredibly rare,” he said. “The problem is there’s no feedback loop right now. Marketers aren’t getting useful data back so they aren’t getting better,” he added.Agencies say the remedy to that situation is to partner with publishers that are willing to tweak their sponsored content offerings and to learn with their clients.“There’s always something you didn’t think about, so there needs to be good faith in the relationship. Publishers need to flexible, and open to adjustments and additions,” said Tony Effik, VP of Media & Connections at digital agency R/GA.“When you’re doing this well it’s not like you launch and come back a month later to ask if it works,” added Kevin Gentzel, Chief Revenue Officer at the Washington Post. “You’re constantly honing, so it’s important [for clients] to be clear about what success looks like throughout the relationship.”But, to Ms. Losee’s point, that doesn’t mean brands should jump in without a clear idea of what they’re hoping to achieve.“There are a ton of companies out there making mistakes,” Mr. Effik concluded. “As long as you come into it with a clear strategy and goals then it’s easy to see the role of sponsored content in a plan. But I see a lot of people doing native for the sake of it, and that doesn’t make sense.”."
Are You Disabled? Your Boss Needs to Know,"March 18, 2014 8:21 p.m. ET","By Lauren WeberMarch 18, 2014 8:21 p.m. ETNearly a quarter of the U.S. workforce will soon have to answer a personal question from the boss: Are you disabled?U.S. regulations going into effect next week require for the first time that federal contractors—a group that includes Boeing Co. , Dell Inc. and AT&T Inc., among some 40,000 others—ask their employees if they have a disability.Those that don't employ a minimum of 7% disabled workers, or can't prove they are taking steps to achieve that goal, could face penalties and, in the most extreme cases, the loss of their contracts, according to a government official. The target applies to contractors with 50 or more employees or more than $50,000 in government work.The Labor Department issued the rules as part of an effort to reduce the high jobless rate among people with disabilities; a similar initiative calls for an 8% hiring target for military veterans. Government officials say the targets are ""aspirational"" and not rigid quotas.Federal contractors, like Boeing, are required to ask workers if they have a disability. Pictured, a Boeing plant. REUTERSEmployees aren't required to disclose their specific impairment.Still, the rules have left contractors anxious about stepping on legal minefields. The Americans With Disabilities Act, or ADA, forbids companies to gather information on a worker's disability status, since the disclosures could lead to discrimination. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has made an exception so that federal contractors can comply with the new rules.Now, these companies face a dilemma. If not enough workers come forward to self-identify as disabled, company recruiters will need to retool their hiring practices to show they are trying to meet the targets. But employees may be uneasy disclosing health-related information to their bosses.""The word disability means you're not able to do something. People don't want to be perceived that way,"" said Joe Gavigan, a 37-year-old engineer at contractor GE Aviation. Mr. Gavigan was paralyzed in 1999 while a student at the U.S. Air Force Academy and later co-founded an employee resource group for individuals with disabilities at the General Electric Co. unit.""You don't want your boss to see you as being limited in your capability,"" he said.A 2008 amendment to the ADA expands the definition of disability. Alongside long-recognized impairments like blindness, the list now includes conditions such as cancer, diabetes, major depression, epilepsy and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Under that broader definition, many large companies may meet or surpass the 7% target already, said Daniel Yager, president of the HR Policy Association.The number of disabled workers will be accurately captured only if employees are willing to raise their hands and be counted.""A lot of employees don't see those issues as being properly categorized as disabilities. They see it as something they've learned to live with,"" said Chris Miller, vice president of employee relations at electric-power utility Southern Co. , an Atlanta-based contractor with 26,000 workers.At Intuitive Research and Technology Corp. in Huntsville, Ala., an engineering firm with contracts from the Department of Defense, 19% of workers have disabilities, said Juanita Phillips, director of human resources. Intuitive recruits and sponsors classes and lecture series at the nearby Redstone Arsenal, a U.S. Army post. The partnership helps Intuitive meet two compliance goals at once by hiring veterans, some of whom have disabilities because of military service-related injuries.Still, Ms. Phillips said, ""We have people who are visibly handicapped that choose not to self-identify as such.""The new guidelines were pushed in part by disability advocates, who say that previous government rules were ineffective at finding jobs for veterans and victims of illness or accident, even while technology has expanded the categories of jobs they are able to perform.Individuals with disabilities had an unemployment rate of 14.3% in February, nearly twice that of the nondisabled population. They are more than three times less likely than other workers to be in the labor force at all, a figure that has hardly changed over the last five years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.But even some of the rule's proponents admit that a groundswell of hiring from that pool is unlikely to occur if employers are able to prove that enough disabled workers are already on the payroll.""Why have the target in there if it's not encouraging the hiring of people with disabilities?"" asked Mike Aitken, vice president of government affairs at the Society for Human Resource Management.Employers are gearing up now to implement the survey. Pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co., subject to the new rules because of supply contracts with the Department of Veterans Affairs and other agencies, plans to use its internal newsletters to address the changes with its 29,000 U.S. workers.""We're putting our toe in the water on this and right now we're vetting"" the materials, said David Gonzales, chief diversity officer. ""Our focus is to make sure it's done in a very safe, private and confidential manner,"" he said, declining to provide further details.While acknowledging that collecting the data is no easy task, Labor Department officials say the challenge itself will make workplaces more accommodating.""It is a cultural change,"" said Patricia Shiu, director of the office that issued and oversees the rules. ""Part of this is about creating an environment where people feel safe identifying that they are a person with a disability, that they won't be retaliated against if they ask for reasonable accommodations.""As a model, employers could look to their programs aimed at gays and lesbians, since sexual orientation, like most disabilities, isn't apparent without some form of self-disclosure, said Jill Houghton, executive director of the U.S. Business Leadership Network, a nonprofit group that assists companies with hiring people with disabilities.The government has also established language for the self-identification surveys, which includes examples of qualified disabilities that workers may not realize fall under the ADA, such as cancer and major depression.The three options: ""yes,"" ""no,"" and ""I don't wish to answer.""Write to Lauren Weber at lauren.weber@wsj.com"
Leo Strine Nominated to Head Delaware Supreme Court,"Updated Jan. 8, 2014 7:34 p.m. ET","Leo E. Strine Jr., shown in 2010, has defended the rights of directors. ASSOCIATED PRESSBy Liz HoffmanUpdated Jan. 8, 2014 7:34 p.m. ETDelaware's governor nominated Chancellor Leo E. Strine Jr. as the next chief justice of the state's supreme court, in a widely expected promotion for one of corporate law's biggest personalities.If confirmed, the 49-year-old Mr. Strine, who currently heads the lower Court of Chancery, will fill the seat vacated in November by Myron Steele.The Delaware Supreme Court is the final arbiter of many corporate disputes, because Delaware is the legal home of more than half of all U.S.-listed companies, according to the secretary of state's office.During Mr. Strine's 15-year tenure, the Chancery Court, essentially a trial court for corporate disputes, grappled with an explosion in shareholder litigation, especially lawsuits challenging mergers and acquisitions. As plaintiffs have brought more cases—98% of M&A deals are now challenged, up from about half in 2007—Mr. Strine and his colleagues have tried to present the court as an honest broker, weeding out nuisance suits from those uncovering misconduct.MORELaw Blog: Strine Notables & QuotablesMr. Strine, whose nomination was announced Wednesday by Gov. Jack A. Markell, beat out three other contenders, all sitting Delaware judges.In a statement, Mr. Strine said that, if confirmed, he would aim to ""preserve Delaware's tradition of judicial excellence and address the new challenges and opportunities to our state resulting from a rapidly globalizing economy.""Mr. Strine's confirmation would set off the search for his successor as chancellor. Early speculation has focused on J. Travis Laster, a vice chancellor of the Chancery Court, local attorney Andre Bouchard, and Jan Jurden, a Superior Court judge who had applied for the chief justice's seat, according to a person familiar with the matter.A person in Ms. Jurden's chambers said she declined to comment. Mr. Laster declined to comment. Mr. Bouchard didn't reply to requests for comment.Mr. Bouchard would be a notable choice because, while most Chancery Court judges come up through the defense bar, representing companies, Mr. Bouchard has also represented shareholders in corporate disputes. He has successfully sued companies including Yahoo Inc. and American International Group Inc . on behalf of investors.Though quick to chide corporate boards that step out of bounds, Mr. Strine mostly has defended the rights of directors to manage and sell their companies without being second-guessedIn 2012, Mr. Strine awarded $1.26 billion in damages to shareholders of a South American mining firm that engineered what he found was a sweetheart deal between two of its subsidiaries, and a record $300 million in fees to their lawyers.This past summer, he quashed a challenge to Dell Inc.'s directors' decision to change the voting standard for its $25 billion buyout after an early tally fell short of blessing the deal. In June, he said companies could force shareholders to sue them only in Delaware, a ruling delivered over strong objections from the investor community.And he has shown thinning patience with the rise in shareholder challenges to M&A deals, last year rejecting a settlement in a case he felt was baseless and should have been withdrawn.Mr. Strine is about the closest thing to a celebrity in the buttoned-up world of corporate law. His courtroom demeanor—sometimes charming, sometimes caustic, often unpredictable— has earned him both fans and detractors.He once called fashion designer Tory Burch's divorce a ""drunken WASP fest,"" only to be told she is Jewish. He compared a phone call between El Paso Corp. Chief Executive Doug Foshee and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief Lloyd Blankfein, a transcript of which was aired in litigation over El Paso's 2012 buyout, to Lionel Richie's 1984 love ballad ""Hello.""His rulings are peppered with pop-culture references, ranging from ""Jersey Shore"" reality star Snooki to Takeru Kobayashi, the Japanese hot dog-eating champion. He also has name-checked Paris Hilton, Elvis Costello, Fritos (he's a fan) and Topsider shoes (not so much).Mr. Strine has a tendency to opine on legal issues not technically before him, a habit that has earned him unusual public rebukes from the state's supreme court.A fast riser in the legal world, he spent just two years as an associate at corporate-law powerhouse Skadden, Arps, Slate Meagher & Flom LLP before coming the top legal counselor to then-Gov. Tom Carper.In 1998 he was named the youngest judge in the history of the Chancery Court, and was promoted to its chief in 2011.His first confirmation was bumpy, after he rankled some legislators while at the governor's office, Dover insiders say. Mr. Strine got 12 votes in the Legislature at his first confirmation hearing, just one more than he needed. His confirmation as chancellor in 2011 was unanimous: He received all 21 votes.While widely known for his expertise on corporate issues, the chancellor also sits on the state's pardon board. The Delaware Supreme Court hears criminal cases, including death-penalty appeals, in addition to its corporate docket.Corrections & AmplificationsAn earlier version of this article reported incorrectly that Mr. Strine ruled in May that companies could force shareholders to sue them only in Delaware. That ruling came in June.Write to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com"

CIO Adriana “Andi” Karaboutis is leaving to join Biogen Idec executive vice president of technology and business solutions, the biotechnology firm said Thursday. She will start Sept. 24, reporting to Biogen CEO George Scangos.“As the pace of digital innovation accelerates, Andi will play a critical role in our mission to improve human health and support those who serve patients,”  Mr. Scangos said in a statement.Andi KaraboutisMs. Karaboutis will oversee Biogen’s information technology operations and advance the company’s use of technology to improve engagement with patients and health-care providers, the company said. Her role will include using analytics software to accelerate drug discovery and glean insight from clinical data. She will also work on wearable and ingestible devices to improve health care.Ms. Karaboutis comes with experience in Big Data and wearables. Over her nearly three year tenure as Dell CIO, she has leveraged analytics to track customer behavior and transactions and evaluated wearable computer use in the workplace.In an interview with CIO Journal earlier this year, she described successful CIOs as being well-rounded individuals with the ability to focus on improving existing technologies in the data centers while looking forward to the latest technology trends, such as mobility, consumerization and wearables.Ms. Karaboutis also shared her thoughts about diversity. “Having girls and women united in the STEM disciplines is going to provide that feeder pool so we can start building more diverse teams,” she said. ” People want diversity. It makes for a more high-performing team.”Ms. Karaboutis joined Dell in March 2010 as vice president of IT. She was promoted to CIO in November 2011.“During her Dell tenure, Andi helped expand our capabilities, drove a culture of innovation throughout IT and our company, and won numerous external accolades for her achievements,” Dell spokesman David Frink told CIO Journal. “We’re grateful for Andi’s service to Dell and wish her well in her new endeavor.”Her last day at Dell is Sept. 5. Mr. Frink said Dell is “engaged in the process to identify her successor.”At Biogen, Ms. Karaboutis will have to learn a new business. The company devises therapies to treat diseases such as multiple sclerosis and hemophilia. She has switched industries before. Prior to joining Dell, she held global IT and business operations roles at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co."
"EqualLogic Co-Founder Paula Long’s Latest Startup, DataGravity, Launches","Aug 19, 2014 12:01 am ET","By Deborah GageAug 19, 2014 12:01 am ET0 COMMENTSSerial entrepreneur Paula Long has a new venture: DataGravity Inc. DATAGRAVITY INC.Serial entrepreneur Paula Long, one of the few females who has started hard-core technology companies that sell products to businesses, released more details on her latest venture—DataGravity Inc., a startup that is using technology to bring intelligence to data storage.Ms. Long previously co-founded EqualLogic Inc., a storage area networking company that was acquired by Dell Inc. in 2008 for about $1.4 billion. That price was more than 10 times EqualLogic’s trailing revenue and became at the time Dell’s largest purchase ever, according to The Wall Street Journal.Her new company so far has raised $42 million from investors including General Catalyst Partners, Andreessen Horowitz and Charles River Ventures (also an investor in EqualLogic).DataGravity is preparing to ship a storage array that Ms. Long said can tell you about the data you have—who’s reading it, who’s writing it, what’s changed with it and so on. Older storage arrays may also have some of that knowledge but were not designed to surface it because the impact on performance was too great.Such arrays are full of “bridges to nowhere,” she said. “Data gets to a certain point and there’s no way to get it to the next point….It seems obvious that storage should be automated, but we needed a new architecture. We needed to think about the problem differently.”Beta customers, which include two law firms and a retailer, keep finding new questions to ask about their data as they learn more about it, according to co-founder and President John Joseph, who also worked at EqualLogic. One law firm, for instance, is using it to find potential conflicts of interest between attorneys.He said he expects DataGravity to “reshape work flow between people in business functions, not just in IT” as they learn new ways to work with their data and cooperate while doing it.Board member Peter Levine said he was introduced to Ms. Long by a mutual friend at about the same time that he joined Andreessen Horowitz, which was in 2011–not so he could invest in her company, but so she could help him vet potential storage deals.He called her “probably the most knowledgeable person in storage I’ve ever met,” despite his own deep background in storage, and said he was “blown away” when he saw the product.For instance, he said, DataGravity can “know when somebody is trying to open a file or access a file before they ever access a file. It’s always afterward that people have forensics [but] this fundamentally changes how you think about data sitting on a system…and that’s just one little piece.”DataGravity plans to ship its product, the DataGravity Discovery Series, in October. Ms. Long said she assumes her competitors will include Nimble Storage Inc. and Tintri Inc. Although the idea that her company will also compete with storage giants EMC Corp. and NetApp Inc. is flattering, she said, “it will take us awhile to get those creds.”As for being a woman working in enterprise tech, which is still mostly male, Ms. Long, who’s DataGravity’s chief executive, said it’s important for female entrepreneurs to talk about their successes and not just their struggles.Being an entrepreneur is hard for everybody, male or female, she said, and “success makes it easier for females to understand that they can be successful too….Don’t be apologetic.”Write to Deborah Gage at deborah.gage@wsj.com.

Turning Employees Into Ethics Believers,"Sep 26, 2014 9:33 am ET","By Ben DiPietroSep 26, 2014 9:33 am ET0 COMMENTSA strong ethical culture at a company is widely seen as a bulwark against compliance failures, because it makes employees more prone to question what they see as unethical behavior.ISTOCKPHOTO.COM Which road to choose?At the same time, it’s hard to go about establishing such a culture.

Both companies opted to endorse aspirational sets of values but then went about promoting the codes in different ways, with Kellogg focusing on targeted training and Dell employing blogs, social media and even a game.Kellogg’s original version was a “be nice” code with “some aspiration in it, but not to the extent we were interested in,” said Jim Sholl, vice president of internal audit and compliance. Working with ethics and culture advisory firm LRN, he said the company wanted to make the code less a series of rules and to incorporate all its longstanding “K Values” of integrity, accountability, passion, humility, simplicity and results. “The prior code concentrated on one of the K values—integrity—and we wanted to touch on all K values in the new code,” he said.The company went through each section of the code, picking out what was relevant in terms of each K value. It structured the revised code so employees could refer to it on a daily basis as they worked through ethical issues, and it included real-life examples of situations in which employees could find themselves, Mr. Sholl said.Once Kellogg rolled out its code at the end of 2012, the focus shifted to training, said Emeka Nwankpah, Kellogg’s director of ethics and compliance. There is now overarching training for all employees and targeted training for specific workers depending on their level and the audience with which they interact, he said. This approach allows people to “have the right awareness, the right knowledge base, then blend that in with the overarching values we have,” he said. “Together, that should guide their decisions, which should lead to better outcomes.”Dell, which overhauled its ethics code in 2010, wanted to reinvent its code to emphasize the relevance of ethics and compliance to business performance and make employees more accountable for their decisions.Dell Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer Mike McLaughlin said the aim of the new approach to the code of ethics was to get employees to be “believers” rather than “obeyers.” While both believers and obeyers need to follow the rules, having believers makes them ambassadors for the company’s ethics and values and gets them to inspire others to do the right thing. “They feel a sense of pride,” he said. “I think if they’re infused with that kind of pride it helps with their interactions with customers and others. It shows externally and internally.”Mr. McLaughlin said it was important to deepen employee engagement with ethics and compliance so subjects such as data privacy rules or anti-corruption laws could be tied more closely to business outcomes. To accomplish that, the company made its code more aspirational in tone. “The code is the foundation of what we’re trying to do,” he said. The changes “take it to the next level so employees can feel to the core that these issues matter every single day.”To get more buy-in from employees, Dell asked employees worldwide for input, so when the code was released it would “truly feel to them what we believe in, as opposed to being told what you should believe in,” said Mr. McLaughlin. The message was spread through various channels, including blogs, social media and even a game developed by LRN called the Honesty Project.The game is designed to reinforce the lessons of why ethics and compliance are important by allowing employees to describe the damage corruption and bribery causes, recognize red flags that may indicate corruption or bribery and identify who to contact if they are asked to pay a bribe or witness a bribe being paid. In the first six days after the game was introduced, more than 5,200 employees completed it—some taking it more than once.To measure how effective the effort has been, Dell sent out a voluntary survey to its employees, and received back more than 33,000 responses, Mr. McLaughlin said. “In that data we’ve seen employees with increased engagement and awareness of these topics,” he said.Write to Ben DiPietro at ben.dipietro@dowjones.com, and follow him on Twitter @BenDiPietro1."

The Two-Day Laptop Battery Is Here,"Updated Jan. 21, 2015 3:42 p.m. ET","The Two-Day Laptop BatteryScrambling to recharge laptop batteries is a huge annoyance. But new models from Acer, Apple, Dell and Lenovo can keep going and going. Personal Tech columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler finds which one lasts the longest.By Geoffrey A. FowlerUpdated Jan. 21, 2015 3:42 p.m. ET23 COMMENTSIn the span of two days last week, I traveled back and forth to the office twice, wrote this column, streamed two episodes of “Sherlock,” drank seven cups of coffee and recharged my phone four times. I never once plugged in my laptop.Laptops have a new talent: ultra-marathoning. Computers coming this winter can last up to 22 hours on a single charge. That’s enough battery for two full days of work…or one really, really bad day.MOREHow We Test Laptop BatteriesDell XPS 13 Review: The MacBook Air Meets Its MatchBattery life is the ultimate party pooper. No matter how amazing my shiny new phone, laptop, camera or watch might be, I still have to run around finding a place to plug it in. On my last business trip, I had to pack a power strip.We demand the impossible from our gadgets—to be fast, light as a feather, cheap, with enviable looks and batteries that go on and on. Here’s the thing: With laptops, at least, we’re actually getting close to having it all.You’ve long been able to buy a battery that was so big it transformed your laptop into a luggable desktop. But the latest 13-inch laptops from Apple, Acer, Dell and Lenovo pack enough oomph to do real work in a package you can hold in one hand. I borrowed them all, then unplugged them.A $108 external battery helps extend the battery life of the Dell XPS 13 to over 18.5 hours. PHOTO: JASON HENRY FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNALThe laptop with the most stamina, by far, is the Lenovo ThinkPad X250. Shipping next month for $1,150 and up, the model I tested will be offered with an extra-large removable battery that helped it last over 21-and-a-half hours in one of my stress tests.The laptop that most won my admiration is the new $800-and-up Dell XPS 13. Its battery clocked in at about 12 hours, then went to more than 18.5 hours with the help of a separate $108 power companion. What’s remarkable is that the Dell does this in a 2.6-pound form that’s cheaper, smaller and even a bit lighter than the famously svelte $1,000 13-inch MacBook Air. (Without the companion, Dell’s battery also lasted just a hair longer than the Air.)The Dell XPS 13 is the laptop to beat in 2015, at least until we see what Apple has in store when it redesigns the MacBook Air, which hasn’t changed in style since 2010.How did laptops get to two-day territory while smartphones still struggle to make one? They face different challenges. Phones waste a lot of juice connecting to cell networks and have far less space to stash batteries. But laptops have to do a lot more processor-demanding work and have larger screens.Much of the recent improvement in laptop life can be attributed to the efficiency of the processors inside them. The latest models from Acer, Dell and Lenovo contain a new kind of processor from Intel , 5th Generation Core, that adds about 90 minutes of battery life, compared with last year’s laptops. And older models, like the current MacBook Air, contain last-generation Intel chips that still provided a massive 50% battery boost over anything from early 2013 or before.Processors have learned how to turn off more and more nonessential functions when you don’t need them. Why be ready to crunch the numbers to render 3-D imagery when all you’re doing is scanning top-10 lists of cats?From left to right: an Acer, Lenovo ThinkPad, Apple MacBook Air and Dell. PHOTO: JASON HENRY FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNALAnd processors aren’t the only battery hogs. Displays and wireless radios drain juice, and other factors affecting battery life include the operating system, the type of storage, and, of course, the size and density of the battery.Because we all use laptops differently, there’s no perfect battery test. Companies make claims based on tests that don’t necessarily reflect real life. That’s why their lawyers make them stick lots of asterisks on their ads.To cut through the confusion, and achieve the results I discussed above, I used a trio of tests. First, I played a never-ending loop of nature videos stored on their hard drives, simulating the movie marathon you might queue up on the world’s longest flight. Second, I ran a program (developed by the industrywide Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium) in their Web browsers to load and scroll through some of the most popular sites over and over again. Finally, I just used them in my life. (You can read more about these tests here.)Here are the battery-life dimensions you should consider when buying a laptop in 2015:Chips: Processors have become so efficient, any road warrior will want a laptop made no earlier than June 2013, when Intel’s 4th Generation Core came out. And if you can, get one with this year’s 5th Generation Core. Intel and its laptop-building partners don’t make it easy to spot the difference—for this year’s models, the name of the processor should include “5th Generation” or read “5000-something.”There’s another kind of processor, called Core M, that consumes less energy but also has less processing power for demanding work. Makers tend to use it in ultra-portable laptops that weigh less, with smaller batteries that can’t last as long. Toshiba ’s upcoming Core M laptop, the Portégé Z20t, is expected to get 17.4 hours of battery life. (The company couldn’t get me one to test in time for this review.)The Lenovo ThinkPad X250 lasted over 21.5 hours in the Journal’s testing. PHOTO: JASON HENRY FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNALScreens: The bigger, brighter and sharper your screen, the harder your battery will have to work. If you want any laptop to last longer, crank down the brightness on the screen. I used a light meter in all my lab tests to put them on equal footing, which meant setting most of them to roughly 70%.Resolution, too, plays a role in power performance. It’s no surprise that the Lenovo had the lowest resolution of the group, though it was passable. There has yet to be a high-resolution MacBook Air, either. The Acer I tested has a high-res touch screen—and poorer battery life.In my tests, a Dell XPS 13 with a relatively standard 1920x1080-pixel screen lasted about four hours longer than one with a Quad HD+ 3200x1800-pixel display. (I also find these higher-resolution screens maddening to use with Windows 8, which can make some apps look impossibly tiny.)Watt Hours: Every system may draw on a battery differently, but not all batteries are created equal, either. These days, battery capacity is measured in watt hours (Wh). Dell’s XPS 13 includes a 52 Wh battery, while Lenovo packs two in the X250—a 23.2 Wh internal and a 72 Wh add-on.Batteries still have a problem with losing capacity with repeated use. I noticed a degradation even in the three weeks I tested these laptops. Laptops that let you swap in new batteries, like the Lenovo ThinkPad, make it easier to deal with the inevitable decline than those that bury the batteries deep inside, like the MacBook Air and Dell XPS 13.Design: Different theories about where to stash those batteries also impact the shape and weight of laptops. No doubt about it, the 72 Wh add-on battery gives Lenovo’s ThinkPad X250 a hefty backside—and brings the total weight to 3.6 pounds. It’s still lighter than most laptops from just a few years ago, but I could feel it tugging in my bag.Dell gets to two-day battery territory by selling that optional power companion, a 43 Wh carry-along battery backup. Surprisingly, it was a huge success in my real-world test. I liked having it in my backpack as a security blanket for my laptop’s battery life, and as a way to charge my phone and tablet via USB. If one more thing can save me from carrying three extra chargers, I’m game.Write to Geoffrey A. Fowler at geoffrey.fowler@wsj.com"

"Chromebook Pixel Review: $1,000 for a Laptop That Only Surfs the Web?","March 11, 2015 2:01 p.m. ET","Chromebook Pixel: Why Pay $1,000 to Surf the Web?There are great laptops and cheap laptops. But if you just want Chrome OS, do you really need a great laptop? WSJ's Joanna Stern reviews Google's latest Chromebook Pixel.By Joanna SternMarch 11, 2015 2:01 p.m. ET34 COMMENTSThere are cheap laptops and great laptops. Cheap laptops are never great, and great laptops are never cheap.OK, it’s not quite from the mouth of Confucius, but it’s a truth that lies at the center of the Chromebook predicament. The best thing about Google ’s GOOGL -2.36% Web-focused laptops is their price, generally about $250. For that, you get a long list of sacrifices. Much of the time, the low-resolution screens are washed-out, the trackpads make your fingers ache and you’d find better feeling plastic in a My Little Pony.Google’s original Pixel stands in contrast to that all, however. It has none of those flaws—and costs about five times the price. On Wednesday, the Pixel got even better with a battery that lasts more than a day, rapid charging technology, a faster processor and some other new tricks, plus a substantial price drop.All that money for a beautiful computer that just browses the Web—are you a lunatic?! That’s what I’d say to someone considering the $1,300 Pixel, when it was introduced two years ago. But today, paying just a little less than that for a premium Chromebook doesn’t seem so insane.The all-aluminum Pixel stands in contrast to Acer’s mostly plastic Chromebook 15. PHOTO: EMILY PRAPUOLENIS/THE WALL STREET JOURNALNot only is the improved Pixel’s price down to $1,000, the advancements of the Web and our comfort with the cloud and mobile tech mean we don’t need computers to do much more than run a Web browser.Still, while Chromebooks have become a serious threat to low-cost Windows PCs and the iPad over the past few years, the feat of engineering that is Pixel feels like overkill. Its software limitations make it tough to recommend against similarly priced Windows and Mac computers.Refined HardwareIt’s hard to complain that the new Pixel looks almost identical to the old Pixel when the original remains one of the best laptops I’ve ever used. The rock-solid, anodized-aluminum design makes it one of the most well-crafted laptops to ever come off an assembly line. And the glowing, rainbow light bar hasn’t lost its novelty, especially with airplane seatmates. It now has a purpose, too. Tap twice on the lid and it becomes a battery meter.The Pixel's keys are incredibly sturdy. PHOTO: EMILY PRAPUOLENIS/THE WALL STREET JOURNALAnd there’s more quality in the details. Its sturdy backlit, squared-off keys have a perfect rigidity and bounce. When it comes to multi-touch gestures and regular navigation, the glass trackpad is as responsive as a MacBook’s. I also much preferred the trackpad to poking a finger at the Pixel’s touch screen; Chrome OS is still easier to navigate with a traditional cursor.Besides, the 12.85-inch, 2560x1700-pixel screen is too gorgeously crisp and bright to cover in fingerprints. It’s still way too reflective, though, especially for working outside.I do wish Google would have shaved a bit off the thickness and weight of the 3.3-pound, 0.6-inch-thick system, especially considering that the new Pixel has two new, thinner USB Type-C ports made for slim devices. Yes, this is the same port that’s on the new MacBook. The tiny socket—similar in size to a MicroUSB port found on many Android phones and tablets—can completely charge up the laptop in a little more than an hour. (A laptop like the Dell XPS 13 only gets to 50% in that time.) It also has bi-directional power, so you can use the port to charge a phone or even another laptop, or send video to a display. But you’ll need the right adapter. A Type-C-to-standard-USB adapter costs $13, but as more companies adapt to this standard, new devices will come with Type-C cords.The Pixel is one of the first laptops to have a USB Type-C charging port. PHOTO: EMILY PRAPUOLENIS/THE WALL STREET JOURNALThe big excitement is that the plug is reversible—no more failed attempts to stick in your USB cable upside down. The hope is that USB-C will replace the older standard. Unlike Apple’s new MacBook, however, the Pixel reflects its maker’s understanding that regular USB matters and has two of those ports as well.What’s more impressive is that you don’t have to charge the Pixel that often. The battery lasted over 11 hours in our grueling battery rundown test with brightness at about 75%. In actual use, I was able to make it through a 12-hour travel day before the system conked out.The Pixel doesn’t skimp on power for that endurance, either. With Intel’s latest Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, it is extremely zippy—noticeably faster than lower-end Chromebooks, especially when you’re like me and often wind up with 30 open browser tabs.An Evolving WebWeb apps like Microsoft Word make living in Chrome OS easier. PHOTO: GOOGLEYet the biggest difference between the new Pixel and the old one doesn’t have to do with hardware. It has to do with the Web...and with us.So many services and programs that were once system-installed software have become robust Web apps. For the past week, I’ve barely used my MacBook Air. Instead, I’ve written most of my articles in Word Online, streamed my music on Rdio, watched Netflix on my TV using the Chromecast, edited photos in Pixlr Touch, wrote and responded to emails in Gmail and the Outlook Web client and, per usual, spent far too much of my time checking Twitter and Facebook.Android apps, like Vine and Evernote, are now available in the Chrome Web Store. And I even tried a beta version of Adobe’s Photoshop that puts all the power of the classic photo-editing software in the browser.Thanks to the latest incarnation of the Chrome OS, I could easily manage all those browser windows and tabs. To view all open windows, swipe up on the trackpad. You can turn websites into stand-alone programs and dock those on the bottom toolbar. The file system is now good enough that you can easily download files, edit them and attach them.But there were plenty of things I missed about OS X and Windows. There’s still no Web version of some apps I rely on, like Skype, iTunes and FitBit.Chrome OS now has better multitasking features. PHOTO: GOOGLEAnd while all of Google’s apps, including Docs and Gmail, now work fine offline, many apps and websites don’t. For instance, I couldn’t access Word Online when I hopped off Wi-Fi during the last hour of my flight. (Google will no longer offer an LTE version of the Pixel. It says most mobile users just connect with their phone’s personal hot spots.)Peripheral support—especially printing—is also a major issue. I couldn’t for the life of me get my office’s printer to work with the computer, and my new networked hard drive requires a Windows or Mac app to access it remotely. And although the Pixel comes with 1 terabyte of Google Drive space for three years, it has only 32GB of internal storage.That’s why the Pixel still isn’t for everyone. Laptops like the excellent Dell XPS 13 start at $800, and the cheapest MacBooks start at $900. Both have full-fledged operating systems that can, yep, run a Chrome browser, too. If the Pixel cost a few hundred dollars less than either of them, it would be a compelling alternative.Maybe Google’s third time will be the charm. For now, if you are interested in living with Chrome, you’re going to have to ask yourself a deep, philosophical question: Do you want a cheap Chromebook or a great one?—Write to Joanna at joanna.stern@wsj.com and on Twitter at @joannastern."

Analytics Predict Which Patients Will Suffer Post-Surgical Infections,"Feb 11, 2015 6:31 pm ET","By Rachael KingFeb 11, 2015 6:31 pm ET0 COMMENTSThe University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics is reducing the rate of surgical infections by using predictive analytics.  At the end of 2014, the rate of infections for patients of colon surgery dropped 58% over a two year period.Using a variety of data, including information from the patient’s medical records and specifics of the surgery itself such as patient vital signs during the operation, the University of Iowa can predict which patients are likely to face the biggest risk of infection. Before those patients leave the operation room, doctors can create a plan to reduce that risk whether that’s altering medication or using different techniques in treating the wound.UNIVERSITY OF IOWA HOSPITALS AND CLINICS Dr. John Cromwell, associate chief medical officer and director of surgical quality and safety at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.Surgical complications, such as surgical site infections that occur after a patient is discharged, are the most common reasons for unplanned hospital readmission according to a study from Northwestern Medicine and the American College of Surgeons, published February 3 in JAMA. Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicare will, in some cases, reduce reimbursement to a hospital that has too many unplanned readmissions within 30 days.The techniques surgeons use are very precise, but there’s quite a bit of variation in post-surgical care among hospitals and even within units of the same hospital, said Dr. John Cromwell, associate chief medical officer and director of surgical quality and safety at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. “What we’re really trying to do is bring that same precision to the decision-making around the operation,” he told CIO Journal.There are many factors that determine whether a patient gets a surgical site infection, including whether or not the patient suffers from diabetes or hypertension. One of the biggest factors, though, is what actually happens in the operating room during a surgery. That might include the patient’s vital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate during the operation or whether the patient received a large blood transfusion. These variables haven’t been adequately accounted for in post-operative care, said Dr. Cromwell.The University of Iowa took 1,600 patients and built a model of its environment, taking into account hospital procedures in surgery and post operation and the outcomes of previous surgeries and the risk of surgical site infection. After validating that model in another population of patients, the model was loaded into predictive analytics software called Statistica from Dell Inc. That model pulls data from a wide number of sources, including patient medical records, data from registries such as the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project and equipment that monitors blood pressure, telemetry and oxygen levels in the blood.During surgery, as the surgeon closes up the patient’s abdomen, the circulating nurse logs onto a Web portal for the software and enters real-time data such as patient blood loss during the operation, the wound classification and whether it was contaminated, said Dr. Cromwell. That data is combined with the patient’s medical records and run through the model and comes back with the risk of a patient getting a surgical site infection. That risk can determine which medications and techniques doctors use after the operation to minimize the risk of infection.“Our goal has been to get that risk [of developing infection] before the patient leaves the operating room, mainly because there are some therapies out there that don’t make sense to apply to every patient,” said Dr. Cromwell. For instance, in colon surgery,  a risk of surgical site infection varies between 5% and 20%. Using invasive therapies or very expensive therapies on every patient doesn’t always make sense but zeroing in on a very high risk patient “gives us that opportunity to appropriately use those resources,” he said.Write to rachael.king@wsj.comCORRECTION: The rate of infections for patients of colon surgery dropped 58% over a two-year period. An earlier version of this story said the rate of infections dropped for bariatric or weight loss surgery."

Dell’s EMC Purchase Marks Shift From Consumer Supply Chain,"Oct. 12, 2015 3:17 p.m. ET","Dell computers are ready to be shipped in a 1999 file photo. Dell set a standard for supply-chain efficiency before mobile computing and on-demand technology reshaped the consumer market. PHOTO: BLOOMBERG NEWSBy Erica E. PhillipsOct. 12, 2015 3:17 p.m. ET0 COMMENTSDell Inc.’s acquisition of data-storage company EMC Corp. reinforces the computer giant’s shift from its roots as an icon of supply-chain management in manufacturing toward providing technology services to businesses.Dell’s pioneering direct-sales and made-to-order business model placed the PC maker in the upper reaches of research group Gartner Inc.’s Supply Chain Top 25 for several years, and Dell regularly reported remarkably lean inventory levels of four days or less. Dell’s strength in forecasting demand and keeping costs low has become a pillar of supply-chain education.But that model hasn’t kept pace with today’s consumer market, where buyers aren’t interested in waiting several days for a customized Dell desktop to be assembled and shipped. Meanwhile, consumer tastes have shifted to tablets and smartphones, leading to a global decline in the personal computer market.RELATED STORIESDell to Buy EMC for $67 BilionPC Shipments Continue to SlumpDell & EMC: A Question of SizeIn the most recent quarter, researcher Gartner said personal computer shipments fell 7.7% from a year ago.“The build-for-use is becoming less of a differentiator for Dell,” said Matt Eastwood, an analyst with International Data Corp. “They’re trying to get away from the one-off offering to individual consumers,” he said.Dell instead is looking to provide technology services in industries such as health care, education and the military, a strategy increasingly built on cloud-based capabilities rather than the discipline of moving goods efficiently.The shift has been Dell’s main focus since Chief Executive Michael Dell took the company private in a $25 billion buyout in 2013. Since then, the company has aimed to be “an end-to-end solution provider,” which the acquisition of EMC will further foster, Mr. Eastwood said.TOP LOGISTICS NEWSGet the latest logistics and supply chain news and analysis via an email newsletter. Sign up here.Together with private-equity firm Silver Lake, Dell is paying roughly $67 billion in cash and stock to buy EMC. Where Dell focused on the middle market—small and medium-size businesses and small enterprises—EMC’s customers are larger multinationals, opening up new opportunities for Dell.Mr. Eastwood said to watch for the combined Dell-EMC to integrate data technology capabilities into all kinds of devices, from industrial equipment to medical imaging systems. “You’re going to see a need for a lot more technology inside the factory floor,” he said. That could return Dell to the forefront of supply-chain innovation, Mr. Eastwood said, this time serving businesses rather than consumers.Dell isn’t new to enterprise software and business solutions, said Jeffrey Hewitt, an analyst with Gartner. “I don’t know that this signals any major shift or change,” he said. “I think they’re going to try to make this complement that change.”Mr. Hewitt said the “big question mark” is how Dell and EMC will integrate their services. Dell is “arguably a tremendous powerhouse of the supply chain,” Mr. Hewitt said. “That’s where the rubber’s met the road with Dell,” but EMC has different strengths.“They’re looking toward a broader return from services and support and it’s going to take a while to get there,” Mr. Hewitt said.Write to Erica E.

Dell & EMC: A Question of Size,"Oct. 9, 2015 3:49 p.m. ET","Dell and its bankers are working to line up around $40 billion in debt financing for the EMC deal. PHOTO: BAZUKI MUHAMMAD/REUTERSBy Dan Gallagher and Richard BarleyOct. 9, 2015 3:49 p.m. ET6 COMMENTSTalk of Dell buying EMC has been flying fast and furious. From that, two big questions emerge: Can such a deal get done? And is it worth the doing?The answer to the first seems to be, “yes,” though it would be far from simple. Dell and its bankers are working to line up around $40 billion in debt financing, according to The Wall Street Journal. Even so, that would only cover a portion of the premium likely needed to seal the deal, which could total close to $60 billion.EMC has about $7.4 billion in net cash, so Dell would likely need to sell a portion of EMC’s ownership stake in VMware to raise funds or get investors such as Michael Dell to stump up additional equity.Aside from that, mega-debt deals aren’t easy sells, though they are possible. Verizon Communications successfully raised $49 billion from a single sale in 2013. But Verizon had investment-grade ratings, paid up handsomely and was issuing into a market hungry for yield.The U.S. high-yield market of 2015 is a different beast: Year-to-date returns are negative, investors have been pulling cash out, and the appetite to take risk is limited.Dell itself took on considerable debt to go private two years ago. Fortunately, its experience could help. Dell has so far displayed a good track record in reducing debt and all three ratings companies have dished out upgrades.Even if the financing is there, though, it won’t be cheap. U.S. “junk” bond yields have risen to their highest in four years to 7.73%, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. high-yield index. A megadeal like Dell/EMC will need to offer a premium.That said, there are some technical tailwinds. Index-tracking funds could be a fertile source of demand as Dell would take a big share in benchmark indexes. And increasingly, large deals are being funded globally, with the European high-yield market now a viable destination for U.S. borrowers.So chances are, financing is possible, though it might prove costly. Whether that is worth the cost is less clear.A combined Dell/EMC would create a huge beast just as Hewlett-Packard—the current 800-pound gorilla of the space—is about to slim down. And HP’s enterprise spinoff will be free of the weight of the slumping personal-computer business; Rod Hall of J.P. Morgan estimates PC sales will account for 57% of Dell’s total revenue this year.The argument for a merger will likely rest on the idea Dell and EMC are mostly complementary businesses that can create a sort of one-stop shop for corporate tech needs. The combination would add EMC’s storage business with Dell’s server line.But EMC’s storage business has been slowing. Wall Street expects sales in the unit to grow only 1.1% this year versus 2.5% last year. Putting this business under the Dell umbrella won’t necessarily reverse that.And the deal is likely to be dilutive to EMC’s gross margins, which have averaged 57% over the past three years. Toni Sacconaghi of Sanford C. Bernstein estimates the combined company would have gross margins around 35%. Plus, a lack of product overlap may limit how much cost-cutting the companies could undertake.So investors are right to be wary of Dell’s ambitions to size up. Bigger isn’t always better.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com and Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.com"

Why Dell’s EMC Bid Leaves VMware Looking Like Devalued Currency,"Updated Oct. 12, 2015 8:14 p.m. ET","VMware’s California headquarters PHOTO: KRIS TRIPPLAAR/SIPA USA/ASSOCIATED PRESSBy Dan GallagherUpdated Oct. 12, 2015 8:14 p.m. ET2 COMMENTSVMware VMW -0.65% will move to new ownership digs if Michael Dell’s plan to purchase EMC goes through. But VMware investors aren’t thrilled by the idea. Perhaps that is because it leaves them in something of a halfway house.VMware is a major part of Dell’s plan announced Monday to acquire EMC in a deal valued at $67 billion. If completed, it would be the largest tech merger on record and would create a privately held giant with more than $80 billion in annual revenue—roughly on par with IBM .Dell isn’t coughing up all of that itself, however. Nearly one-third of the stated value is riding on a plan to create a tracking stock for VMware. This company specializes in virtualization software that allows servers and other technology equipment to run more efficiently. It is 81% owned by EMC with the remainder trading publicly.As part of the Dell deal, EMC shareholders will receive 0.111 shares of VMware tracking stock for each EMC share they hold. This is in addition to the $24.05 in cash per share they will receive from Dell.That prospect isn’t exactly exciting VMware holders. The company’s market value has slid by 15% since deal reports began circulating last week, erasing more than $5 billion.Part of that is due to disappointment that EMC or Dell didn’t move to buy out VMware altogether. And some concern comes from the idea that the tracking stock could lead to selling from EMC investors who don’t want to maintain ownership of VMware.The deal creates a complicated investment case for VMware. Dell will retain operational control of the company even though it will retain only a 28% economic interest. This is because the tracking stock won’t have voting rights.More important, an investment case for VMware now rests on the idea it will fare better under Dell’s corporate umbrella than it has under EMC’s. In a conference call Monday, EMC chief Joe Tucci said Dell and VMware see more than $1 billion in “revenue synergies” over the next few years.But such synergies were also a key selling point for keeping VMware with EMC. And that hasn’t stopped VMware’s growth from slowing. Wall Street expects VMware’s licensing revenue to grow only 6% this year compared with 14% last year.Slowing growth and uncertainty about its future ownership had already crimped VMware’s valuation. Prior to Monday, the stock’s price as a multiple of forward earnings was at a 3% discount to that of the Nasdaq Composite Index for the year. That compares with an average premium of 26% over 2014, according to FactSet.Having a new owner in the house won’t change that anytime soon.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com"
Debt Markets Hold Key to Dell’s Bold EMC Bid,"Updated Oct. 8, 2015 10:53 p.m. ET","Dell in Talks With EMC Over Possible MergerDell and private equity firm Silver Lake are in advanced talks to buy data storage company EMC, for what could be the biggest technology-industry takeover ever.By Dana Cimilluca,Don Clark andDana MattioliUpdated Oct. 8, 2015 10:53 p.m. ET10 COMMENTSMichael Dell is pressing ahead with partner Silver Lake on a $50 billion-plus acquisition of data-storage giant EMC Corp. , people familiar with the matter said, a bold but risky deal that would require massive debt financing at a time when credit markets have become less hospitable to mergers.Negotiations have advanced and could produce an agreement by next week, the people said. A merger of that size would be the largest ever in the technology industry, and Dell Inc. and Silver Lake are in talks to secure a debt package that could top $40 billion to fund it, one of the people said.The recent rebound in markets has added urgency to the talks. Dell and its advisers have been grappling in recent days with how to finance the takeover at a time when markets are volatile and debt investors have balked at a number of recent takeover-related offerings, another person said. They are eager to get the deal done before credit tightens further, the person said, and the improved climate has given them an opening.The deal would mark an attempt by Mr. Dell to craft a future for a company caught between the shift toward mobile devices such as Apple Inc.’s iPhone and fierce competition among providers of storage capacity and computing power. A merger in theory could transform the PC and server specialist Mr. Dell took private two years ago into a one-stop shop capable of serving a full range of corporate computing needs.A combined Dell-EMC would encompass computing, networking and storage—both hardware and software—giving it the breadth to compete more effectively with larger companies such as International Business Machines Corp. , Hewlett-Packard Co. , Cisco Systems Inc. and Oracle Corp.“Dell and EMC would be a tech behemoth,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Research. “It would change the landscape of enterprise computing.”A deal wouldn’t answer all of the questions facing Dell or EMC. Some close watchers of the tech scene feel that finding ways to unlock stock-market value may outweigh any potential business benefits to the companies.To cover the cost of a deal, closely held Dell and Silver Lake may also need to come up with as much as $20 billion themselves, which they would likely do in part by selling shares in EMC’s VMware Inc. unit, the people said.RELATED READINGDell Is in Talks With EMC Over Possible MergerWarning for M&A: Another Debt Deal StrugglesHow and Why Dell Could Buy EMCA Look at Elliott Management’s Big Tech BetsEMC Weighs Merger, Other Options (Sept. 21, 2014)Activist Investor Pushes EMC to Break Up (July 21, 2014)VMware, which helped develop software that makes corporate data centers more efficient, is seen as the crown jewel of the transaction. EMC currently owns roughly 80% of VMware, which has a market capitalization of about $32 billion. Dell would likely hold on to a controlling stake after any sales, the people said.A merger with EMC would help Dell exploit a trend toward selling bundles of hardware components together, known as converged infrastructure, which eases the need for companies to assemble and test technology combinations themselves. EMC helped pioneer that tactic in a joint venture with Cisco, which now supplies networking and computing gear sold along with EMC storage gear.An acquisition of EMC would also give the company’s new owners a chance to turn around its lackluster performance in recent years outside the glare of public shareholders, much like Dell was. EMC shares rose 4.7% on news of the possible deal Thursday to $27.18. Still, the stock is up 37% in the past five years, versus a 76% gain in the S&P 500.Mr. Dell, who founded his company in his college dorm room in 1984, pioneered direct sales of computers based first on phone calls and later the Web. The company later branched into servers, the mainstay computers used to manage corporate operations, and more recently acquired storage and networking businesses.Both Dell and EMC rely heavily on sales of hardware for corporate data centers, a business expected to gradually decline as more operations are outsourced to cloud-computing services operated by the likes of Amazon.com Inc., Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp., said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.Spokesmen for Dell and EMC declined to comment on the deal talks, first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.This has been a banner year for takeovers, one that has been characterized by megadeals like Dell-EMC. There have been nearly $3.4 trillion of mergers and acquisitions struck world-wide so far this year, according to Dealogic, putting 2015 on pace to possibly be the best year ever for deal making.Should credit investors willingly fund an EMC takeover, it would bode well for other deals and could be a sign that the surge in M&A will continue.Dell and Silver Lake, which helped take the PC and server maker private in a $25 billion leveraged buyout in 2013, have assembled a group of lenders including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse Group to help them secure the debt portion of the deal, the people said. The banks would provide a bridge loan that could later be replaced by investment-grade bonds and syndicated loans, one of the people said.Following record or near-record debt issuance in recent years that supported the M&A surge, credit investors have lately become more fickle. In late September, J.P. Morgan cut a planned high-yield bond sale backing Altice NV’s purchase of Cablevision Systems Corp. by $1.5 billion, making up the difference by selling more debt in the loan market. Leveraged loans are viewed as safer than bonds because they are secured by corporate assets. More recently, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and J.P. Morgan struggled to sell $1.2 billion of loans backing the leveraged buyout of online clothing retailer FullBeauty Brands, investors said this week.PHOTO: BAZUKI MUHAMMAD/REUTERSOne thing working in Dell’s favor as it seeks to cobble together the outsize debt package is EMC’s relatively limited debt load and its investment-grade credit rating. The Hopkinton, Mass., company, had just $7.4 billion of debt and $7.7 billion of cash at the end of June. Dell, meanwhile, had $11.7 billion in debt as of mid-September, according to FactSet, and is junk-rated from both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service.Mr. Dell and Egon Durban of Silver Lake are likely to sell as much as $10 billion of shares in VMware, which would leave them with just over 50% of the software provider; roll over their combined stake of some $7 billion in Dell and between them and possibly others come up with another roughly $5 billion of cash, one of the people said.The talks come at a delicate moment for Dell. A trial concludes Thursday in a Delaware court over whether Mr. Dell and Silver Lake paid a fair price when they took the company private. Former stockholders with claim to about 30 million shares have argued the company was worth roughly double the $13.75-a-share buyout price—a figure Dell rejects, citing headwinds facing its PC business and the risks surrounding its shift toward more-profitable areas.At the high end, the difference amounts to more than $500 million, although a dispute over whether certain shareholders are eligible could reduce that. If Dell is forced to make a large payment, it could make its efforts to pay for EMC that much more difficult.—Shira Ovide and Liz Hoffman contributed to this article.Write to Dana Cimilluca at dana.cimilluca@wsj.com, Don Clark at don.clark@wsj.com and Dana Mattioli at dana.mattioli@wsj.com"
VMware Shares Fall 20% on Investor Concerns About Dell-EMC Deal,"Updated Oct. 21, 2015 6:53 p.m. ET","EMC’s planned changes to VMware’s business surprised investors Wednesday. PHOTO: SIMON DAWSON/BLOOMBERG NEWSBy Robert McMillanUpdated Oct. 21, 2015 6:53 p.m. ET6 COMMENTSMichael Dell envisions the $67 billion merger of the computer company that bears his name with storage giant EMC Corp. as the birth of a business-computing juggernaut. For now, though, EMC’s data-center software subsidiary VMware Inc. VMW -0.65% may be a casualty of the deal’s complexity.Stock in VMware, which trades under its own symbol, dropped nearly 20% Wednesday after EMC said it would reorganize the two companies’ cloud-computing offerings into a subsidiary named Virtustream, which is expected to go live early next year.EMC Chief Executive Joe Tucci said Wednesday in a conference call with investors that Dell wasn’t involved in the decision to create Virtustream, but he acknowledged the market reacted poorly to the news. “I could tell you that what I think didn’t come across was that putting these together will actually save money and actually put more profit on the VMware bottom line,” Mr. Tucci said.The announcement came as a surprise to investors, who were already worried that Dell’s acquisition would prove a distraction to EMC and VMware and that EMC’s offer of a tracking stock linked to VMware’s value would dilute demand for VMware equity. Adding to their concerns, VMware warned investors that operating margins would fall below analyst expectations next year, hurt in part by Virtustream’s costs.The reorganization of cloud assets was one curveball too many for investors, said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. “You have so many moving parts, the last thing you want to do is a joint initiative that further crushes margins for VMware.”Moreover, EMC for some time has been under pressure from investors to spin off VMware, creating uncertainty about the latter’s prospects. VMware Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Chadwick said in a conference call with financial analysts on Tuesday that customer concern over VMware’s future hurt its bookings in its most recent quarter.“Although we expect the Dell acquisition of EMC will give rise to significant revenue synergies for VMware over time, we believe it is realistic to anticipate various disruptions in the near term,” Mr. Chadwick said.VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger expects to realize $1 billion in revenue synergies as a result of the acquisition over the next few years.VMware stock closed at $55.42 on Wednesday, down 32% from its $82.09 price before The Wall Street Journal reported news of the Dell-EMC deal on Oct. 7.Creating a cloud-focused subsidiary wasn’t a bad idea, said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with UBS Group AG. “The problem EMC has is how they’re doing things, not what they’re doing.”Like other large sellers of corporate technology, the Hopkinton, Mass., company is trying to reinvent itself in the face of big changes in how companies buy technology. Companies are moving to cloud-based computing services such as those offered by Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. , and when they do purchase storage systems of the kind EMC specializes in, they have been buying lower-cost systems that bring lower profits.EMC’s quarterly results, reported Wednesday morning, underperformed analyst expectations. Profits for the quarter ended September were a penny below expectations at 43 cents a share, excluding certain items. Revenues were less than 1% higher than year-ago numbers, totaling $6.08 billion, below the $6.17 billion analysts had expected.EMC shares were hurt by the VMware decline and closed at $25.77, down 6.3%. When the acquisition closes, EMC shareholders would receive $24.05 a share in cash along with the tracking stock -- essentially shares in Dell -- that will be linked to EMC’s 80% stake in VMware.Write to Robert McMillan at Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.com"
"Dell May Avoid Tax Hit on Deal, but EMC Shareholders Will Pay","Oct 12, 2015 3:07 pm ET","By Vipal MongaOct 12, 2015 3:07 pm ET0 COMMENTSDell Chaiman and CEO Michael Dell MANJUNATH KIRAN/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGESDell Inc. found a creative way to avoid a hefty tax bill for its proposed $67 billion acquisition of EMC Corp. by using a tracking stock as part of the deal. But EMC shareholders won’t be able to avoid the tax man.Dell announced on Monday that it made an offer for EMC valued at roughly $33.15 a share, for a total of $67 billion in cash and stock. As part of the deal, EMC shareholders would receive $24.05 a share in cash, and another 0.111 shares of a tracking stock tied to EMC’s 80% stake in VMware That works out to roughly $9.10 a share, based on VMware’s $81.78 share price on Oct. 7, according to a Dell company statement.The tracking stock would essentially comprise a new class of shares that track the assets held by VMware. The holders won’t actually own a stake in the company, however. The stock will simply reflect the performance of VMware. Dell won’t be distributing shares or spinning off VMware’s assets, both techniques which create taxable gains.The tracking stock structure allows Dell to avoid a tax bill that could have topped $10 billion, said Robert Willens, a tax specialist. EMC’s cost basis in VMware is very low, and so Dell would have to pay tax on almost the entire $26.59 billion value of EMC’s 80% stake in a sale.“It’s a great tax strategy,” said Mr. Willens.However, EMC shareholders who get the cash and shares will still have to pay up. They will pay tax that ranges between 20% and 39.6% on any gains they make from both the cash and the value of the tracking stock.The complicated structure adds some uncertainty to the final value of the deal. Dell said that the value of the tracking stock may vary from the market price of VMware, given the different characteristics and rights of the two stocks.The two different stocks could also confuse investors, Mr. Willens noted. He said after a deal closes, stock investors will be able to buy either the tracking stock, or part of the 20% of VMware that EMC doesn’t own.VMware’s stock was down more than 10% on Monday afternoon, while EMC’s stock was up almost 2%."

What Dell’s Deal for EMC Means for China Tech,"Oct 13, 2015 6:34 pm HKT","Oct 13, 2015 6:34 pm HKT0 COMMENTSNo China worries? Michael Dell, founder of Dell Inc., speaking in Washington in March. AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGESChina isn’t likely to put major barriers in front of Dell’s $67 billion plan to acquire EMC – but that doesn’t mean the deal won’t be felt there.In the biggest tech deal in history, Dell said Monday it plans to buy data-storage giant EMC. The takeover would aid Dell’s transition to a supplier for large companies from its origins as a consumer-focused company.The combination would push Dell’s and EMC’s combined market share in the China storage sector to No. 1, edging past Huawei, according to market research firm IDC. EMC was the top storage player in China last year, but Huawei took the lead in the first half of 2015 with 16.8% of the market. EMC was No. 2 with 15.2% while Dell was No. 6 with 5.3%.The news is still fresh, and the Chinese government has yet to comment on the matter. Still, EMC has enough strong competitors in China that the deal is unlikely to face major hurdles from Chinese regulators, said Hong Kong-based Bernstein technology analyst Alberto Moel. Their combination would boost Dell’s and EMC’s power in China, but they would still be far from controlling the market, he said.China has increasingly flexed its antitrust muscles in recent years, even in cases that don’t involve Chinese companies. The world’s three largest container-shipping companies were taken by surprise last year when Chinese regulators blocked their planned shipping alliance, which had gained U.S. and European regulatory approval. In April 2013, Glencore PLC finally got Beijing’s nod for its acquisition of mining group Xstrata, five months after the EU and U.S. approved it, after agreeing to sell a major copper project later bought by a Chinese-led consortium.Still, the Dell-EMC could have an impact on two big players in the China tech world due to their overseas ambitions.Lenovo Group Ltd. has run a joint venture with EMC for the past two years to produce data storage products for small- and medium-sized businesses. Analysts say the Dell deal likely means curtains for Lenovo’s EMC partnership.“I expect the partnership between Lenovo and EMC will end very soon and Lenovo will have to find something else,” said Kitty Fok, China head of market research firm IDC.The Lenovo-EMC partnership involved both companies offering the others’ products to clients, as well as joint development of servers and network storage.A Lenovo spokeswoman said the company was shrinking its EMC partnership but downplayed any link to the Dell deal.“Consistent with our strategy, the joint venture has already been scaling back its operations and we don’t expect Dell’s acquisition of EMC to impact Lenovo’s future plans,” she said.Huawei Technologies Co. will also face a stronger competitor as it seeks to build out its enterprise business in China and overseas. The combination of Dell and EMC would result in a broader range of storage products and economies of scale, analysts say. While Dell’s and EMC’s largest global rivals are all U.S. companies – NetApp, Hewlett-Packard and International Business Machines Corp. – Huawei is becoming a bigger rival both in China and in other markets.A Huawei spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Lenovo and Huawei are both seeking to become major international players in enterprise computing.

"The Obscure Chinese Operating System Sold by Dell, HP","Sep 15, 2015 5:30 am HKT","Sep 15, 2015 5:30 am HKT0 COMMENTSA screenshot of a Russian-language version of the NeoKylin operating system. WIKIMEDIA COMMONSDell’s China head recently told The Wall Street Journal that more than 40% of its PCs in China come preloaded not with Microsoft Windows, but with a Chinese operating system called NeoKylin OS.It is a large figure for any non-Windows operating system, much less one that has been around for only half a decade and is virtually unknown outside of China. Long written off by analysts as a serious competitor for Windows, NeoKylin demonstrates the power of China’s push to switch to domestic technology — especially in procurement for government agencies and state-run enterprises.NeoKylin has been a decade and a half in the making. In 2001, Beijing assigned the National University of Defense Technology — which is administered by the country’s defense ministry — the mission of developing a homegrown operating system. The project came under the national government’s 863 Program dedicated to building critical technologies domestically to reduce reliance on foreign countries. Other 863 projects include China’s Tianhe supercomputers and the Shenzhou spacecraft.MORE IN SECURITYAt APEC, Obama Urges Leaders to Fight Climate Change 'Before It's Too Late'Just How Many Nuclear Weapons Does North Korea Have?

The original Kylin website has been taken down, but a cached version from 2004 lists security is a key feature of the OS, and describes the interface as “similar to Windows.”Kylin’s reincarnation, NeoKylin, came about through a tie-up in 2010 between NUTD and China Standard Software, a subsidiary of state-owned tech conglomerate China Electronics Corp. The companies said at the time the OS would be used for national defense and other sectors.The operating system looks and functions much like Windows, with a task bar along the bottom on the screen and windows for applications and folders. Its symbol is a stylized version of the Qilin, the mythical hoofed beast after which it is named.China Standard Software Chief Executive Han Naiping said NeoKylin is currently used by government agencies and companies in the financial sector, among other clients. Dell was the first Western brand to make NeoKylin PCs after the two companies struck a partnership last year, and Hewlett-Packard has since begun to make them as well, he said.Dell’s disclosure of the number of China PCs it ships with NeoKylin – 42% — is one of the first concrete figures demonstrating the scale of China’s shift to domestic technology. But the number certainly comes with a caveat: Windows is widely pirated in China, and it isn’t clear how many people are buying computers loaded with NeoKylin only to replace the software with the Microsoft OS.– Eva Dou.

Windows 10 or OS X? A Mac User Falls For the PC Again,"July 28, 2015 1:54 p.m. ET","Mac vs. PC: The Windows 10 EditionWith Windows 10, the PC has more in common with the Mac than ever. WSJ’s Joanna Stern parodies those classic Mac vs. PC ads—with a surprise 2015 twist. Photo/video: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal.By Joanna SternJuly 28, 2015 1:54 p.m. ET166 COMMENTSYou can blame Vista and the constant pounding of Ctrl+Alt+Del that came with it. Or you can blame those clever Mac vs. PC ads. But about eight years ago, after growing up with Windows computers and countless games of “Solitaire,” I bought my first Mac. And I never looked back.Until now.I’ve spent the past month solely using Windows 10, and I’ve fallen in love with Windows again. In fact, I’ve rarely missed Mac OS X. I’m more productive and faster at handling my many open windows on Microsoft ’s latest than on Apple’s. If you had told me a year ago that I’d write those words, I’d have said you’re on some mind-altering drug.Dell laptop and Apple MacBook Air PHOTO: F. MARTIN RAMIN/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, STYLING BY ANNE CARDENASAfter unsuccessfully zigging for the past few years with Windows 8—which awkwardly layered a touch interface over old-school Windows—Microsoft has zagged back to the desktop it knows best with Windows 10.Available starting Wednesday as a free upgrade on Windows 7 and 8 PCs, it takes the traditional underpinnings and spruces them up with a modern design, a helpful personal assistant and better windows-management tools. Unlike Windows 8, it stays out of your way, just letting you do what you need to do better. It’s what Windows should be in 2015.It’s not surprising that I’ve fallen so hard for Windows 10. For nearly 30 years, the two computing rivals have picked and pulled features from each other. At this point, both Windows 10 and Apple’s upcoming Mac OS X El Capitan have so many nearly identical functions that at times it can feel like playing “Can You Spot the Difference?”Microsoft can at last boast that it does a superior job at many of the new tricks. There’s just one little problem: the iPhone.A Serious MultitaskerThe resurrection of the Start menu, after being killed in Windows 8, was practically celebrated with all-night dancing by Windows users, but the real party should be for Task View. The feature, which displays a shrunken snapshot of all your open windows and programs, has been the single most important feature in my transition back to Windows.That’s because the Mac has, for years, had a similar function called Exposé (now Mission Control) that I use constantly to jump between programs. Just like with OS X, you can access Task View on Windows by swiping three fingers up on a trackpad—if that laptop has a “precision trackpad” like on the Surface Pro 3 or new Dell XPS 13, that is.But even on that impressive Dell, the trackpad seems to require the touch of an angel to consistently work correctly. So I’ve come to rely on the keyboard shortcut (Windows key + Tab). You can also click on the three-rectangle icon in the taskbar.Apple MacBook Air running Windows PHOTO: F. MARTIN RAMIN/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, STYLING BY ANNE CARDENASIronically, I found my MacBook Air to be the best Windows 10 laptop. It may not have a touchscreen, but it was snappier, and beat the Dell and Surface for normal scrolling and navigating. (The three-finger swipe wasn’t enabled during my tests, however.) Windows 10 is in desperate need of a worthy PC laptop.Another thing that’s made me a master Windows 10 multitasker is the ability to easily snap email to one side of the screen and a Web browser to the other. Microsoft included app-snapping in previous Windows versions, but now it suggests other open apps or windows to place next to it. It also lets you tile up to four windows on the screen. It’s a huge time saver, especially when helping herd the stray windows on my external monitor.The feature is so great, Apple put it in its next version of OS X and iOS for the iPad. But Microsoft’s implementation is better, in part because it has addictive keyboard shortcuts (see chart).Windows 10 includes virtual desktops that allow you to better organize your workspace: for instance, a zone for work (Excel and Outlook) and another for play (Twitter, Facebook and YouTube). I don’t use them though, not even on a Mac, which has had virtual desktops for six years.A Serious AssistantI’m now the Usain Bolt of Windows multitasking, but I’ve had a little help from the sidelines—quite literally. On the taskbar lives Cortana, Microsoft’s... Siri. But unlike Siri, Cortana predicts information you may want to know, based off of your email, calendar and searches. It’s a lot like Google Now.For instance, Cortana told me I had a workout class at 5:30 p.m. on my calendar and that I should leave in 15 minutes. However, she only has access to Microsoft’s Mail app, not Outlook, where my corporate mail lives, so she didn’t know I was flying to Hong Kong this week.Cortana’s greatest use to me has been in app launching and quick searches. She responds to spoken commands and questions when she hears her name—“Hey, Cortana, what’s the weather in Hong Kong?” or “Hey, Cortana, launch Spotify”—though it’s quicker to type. She can quickly search the Web (but only with Bing), and can answer some questions in the window.Apple still hasn’t brought Siri to the Mac, but the next OS X has an updated Spotlight that lets you do similar Internet-powered searches—weather, sports scores, stock quotes, etc.—right on the desktop.A Serious DisconnectWindows 10 lets you handle apps outstandingly well. The actual apps, however, aren’t so good. With the exception of OneNote, Microsoft’s note-taking app, almost all of Windows’ included apps lag behind Apple’s—and even Google’s—in features and design.The Mail app is unsightly and confusing—a far cry from the mail app Microsoft offers for the iPhone. The Photos app doesn’t include half the fun tricks of Google Photos or Apple Photos. It’s sad that Paint (which may not have been updated since the Reagan administration) is still your best bet for image editing. There’s no simple built-in video editor program. (Bring back Windows Movie Maker!) I haven’t found a single reason to use the new Groove Music. And Microsoft Office isn’t included, or even very well integrated at this point. (Plus, the new Office for Mac is finally on par with the Windows version.)This wouldn’t be such a bad situation if third-party apps picked up Microsoft’s slack, but that’s often not the case. While I was able to gather some of my essentials—Spotify, Wunderlist to-do app, Slack—either in the Windows Store or directly from software publishers, I never did find a Twitter app or cheap photo editor as good as what I use on my Mac.(You know what there isn’t a lack of? Windows anti-virus apps!) Microsoft made it easier for Android and iOS software to migrate to the new Windows, but the initiative hasn’t yet borne fruit.But most of us spend our computer time in a Web browser. (As Google’s Chromebooks show, even computers that are just browsers sell pretty well these days!) Microsoft hopes we’ll hop on its new Edge browser. It’s fast and cleanly designed, and does some cool things like automatically showing phone numbers, addresses and reviews when you hit certain restaurant or retailer sites, and letting you sketch directly on Web pages. But Edge’s periodic performance issues and lack of browser plug-ins meant keeping Google Chrome as my default browser.In fact, even on my Mac, I spend most my time using Google’s services. In most cases, they’re better, and unlike many of Apple’s, they’re easily accessible on Windows and the Web. Google is proving that you don’t need to own the OS to win.For Microsoft, Apple’s smash-hit smartphone is a bigger problem than Google’s services. Mac owners still might be a niche group, but millions of people own and love iPhones. There’s unprecedented iPhone support in Windows 10, and Microsoft has an abundance of solid iPhone apps that it will remind you about when you plug in your iPhone.The iPhone works with Windows 10, but not as well as it works with Mac OS X. PHOTO: DREW EVANS / THE WALL STREET JOURNALBut there will always be things I can’t do with an iPhone and a Windows PC, like pick up an incoming call right on my laptop, or easily iMessage my entire family. The iPhone has become the beating heart of so many of our digital lives, and Apple, in what I call the ecosystem trap, has engineered all its own devices to work better with it. With Windows 10, Microsoft has put a lot of muscle into getting its phones to integrate better—the only problem is that no one uses Windows Phones and things only seem to be getting worse. For Android phone owners, however, there’s never been a better time to own a Windows PC.Things change. The battle between Windows and OS X is far less important than it was a decade ago. Yes, both operating systems help you get more done than ever, but when our time is spent using apps and services across different-sized screens, the traditional computer screen is just one piece of the puzzle.Microsoft is simply missing too many of the other pieces for me to go back to a PC full time. Still, I’m keeping Windows 10 on my Mac—even if it’s just for a round of “Solitaire” every once in a while."

How to Pick Your Child’s First Computer,"May 10, 2016 12:34 p.m. ET","It's Time to Give Your Child a ComputerAt which age should your children get their own computers? WSJ's Wilson Rothman weighs what matters when parents face that major question. Photo/Video: Emily Prapuolenis/The Wall Street JournalBy Wilson RothmanMay 10, 2016 12:34 p.m. ET32 COMMENTSWhen children first learn to speak, it’s precious. Soon, you can’t shut them up. When they first hop on your computer, pecking at the keyboard and scooting the cursor around with the mouse or trackpad, you exclaim, “They’re so smart!” But after weeks of them hogging your work-issued laptop to print Pokémon coloring pages or Google cats, you wonder if it’s time for a family computer.That’s the story in my house, and a variation on the theme that emerged when I spoke to families and educators around the country. My virtual focus group of 50 parents—all with children of elementary- or middle-school age—proved that the family computer is alive and well. For this crowd, price, durability, safety and battery life were top priorities. But navigating so many new choices can be a challenge.I set out asking a simple question: At what age should children get their own computer?In first or second grade, children start regularly using computers in school. It makes sense for children that age to have access to a computer for learning games and other safe activities. But it shouldn’t belong to your child—it’s a family resource that requires supervision. Even if you’re not worried about them searching for trouble, parents know that even the most saintly YouTube clip can have related videos of a more devilish nature.“Hold off on an individual computer as long as you can,” says Garrett Fogel, a first-grade teacher at Green Elementary School in my town of Dublin, Calif., who has taught nearly every grade from first through eighth and has two boys of his own. “The family computer is usually in a room where parents can monitor it. That’s best for smaller kids,” he says.THE DESKTOPPROS: More power for less money; central, fixed location means lower chances of goofing off; big screen great for work and play. CONS: Requires home real estate you may not have; not easily stowed when you want it gone.PHOTO: MIKE SUDAL/THE WALL STREET JOURNALBy fourth grade, many students are doing quite a bit of computer work at school, and it snowballs from there.“High school is where it becomes more of an issue,” says James Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit advocacy group that promotes safe uses of technology for children and families. “You can see why they want access to their own computer because of the homework factor. But they’re also playing games, so you want to find the balance.”The traditional family PC was a desktop system, permanently fixed in a central location. It’s never been a more cost-effective option. There are towers for $400 to $600 that you can pair with a monitor. As you climb up above $1,000, you also have some slicker all-in-one options, such as an iMac or one of HP ’s Envy touch-screen PCs.Despite the supervisory advantages of a desktop, however, I found that parents increasingly are interested in a computer they can put away. The Windows world has more affordable laptops than Apple’s popular MacBooks. Dell’s Inspiron 11 3000 Series—configured with a touch screen, a Core i3 chip and 128GB of solid-state storage—costs $600. It’s a nicer, sturdier pick than Microsoft ’s own heavily marketed Surface tablet, which starts at $500 without the $130 keyboard.Beware anything below that price and avoid anything without an Intel Co re processor: Truly cheap Windows laptops will leave you frustrated. Even on Microsoft’s own new Windows 10 Edge browser, pages are painfully slow to load.THE HAND-ME-DOWNPROS: Won’t cost you anything; already has software; you already know how to use it. CONS: OS needs to be kept up-to-date; may need RAM or hard-drive upgrades; keyboard, battery, etc. could be past their prime.PHOTO: MIKE SUDAL/THE WALL STREET JOURNALMacBooks, which sell new at $900 or more, most often came up as ideal hand-me-downs. That shiny laptop you bought five years ago may have lost its luster, but most children won’t notice.If you are going to hand over an old Mac or Windows PC, make sure its software is up-to-date. Parental controls are better on the most recent operating systems. So are safety measures that protect computers from phishing and other threats that could afflict children and adults alike. Free software called CloudReady can also help turbocharge a computer that’s past its prime.In some cases, a hand-me-down could benefit from a RAM memory upgrade or a new storage drive. If you swap in a solid-state drive, you could cut your old computer’s boot time in half and speed up a lot of other interactions, too. Worst-case scenario: You have to take the computer in for a new battery.A trickier question: Does the iPad, which may have been a part of a child’s life from a far earlier age, count as a computer? The answer is yes, but given its price it may well not be the one best suited to your needs.Parents and teachers of younger children like iPads because they’re so intuitive to use. Their processing power has, in recent years, become vast. And if a child has to lug a computer around, there’s no lighter option.THE IPADPROS: Versatile for desk work and creative projects; intuitive to children; apps and Web cover most software needs. CONS: Small screen, low storage for high price; can’t teach traditional keyboard-and-mouse computing.PHOTO: MIKE SUDAL/THE WALL STREET JOURNALThe combination of Web browser and app store ensures that children can do most or all of the activities they can do on any other computer, and a bunch of things they can’t do with other devices, such as shoot and edit a movie. Apple’s new iPad Pro models even support a pen that’s great for visual arts.The catch is that all of this comes at a significant cost: A 32GB iPad Pro with keyboard case costs about $750. A cheaper alternative—the iPad Air 2 with a Logitech keyboard case—comes in around $500, but that’s before you pay $100 to bump the unforgivably paltry 16GB of internal storage up to 64GB. And in both scenarios, the screen is just 9.7 inches, and the keyboards aren't very good. (The 12.9-inch iPad Pro with keyboard case costs nearly $1,000.)Kara Larcome, a mother of two and the science, technology, engineering and math curriculum coordinator for North Andover Public Schools in Massachusetts, says that, as she prepares to buy a first family computer, she’s leaning in another direction.Her children are comfortable around iPads, but she wants her 5-year-old to learn to use a trackpad, and to type on a physical keyboard. Since she and her husband already have computers, an inexpensive Chromebook—which runs Google’s Chrome OS and is designed almost entirely around Web browsing—is the most justifiable purchase.One reason Chromebooks have taken off is that many schools are choosing Web-based workbooks and reading modules, say the educators I spoke with.THE CHROMEBOOKPROS: Best performance, biggest screens for lowest price; simple Web interface with supervised controls. CONS: Lacks software, including the popular Minecraft; children with certain interests could outgrow it.PHOTO: MIKE SUDAL/THE WALL STREET JOURNALWhen using Chromebooks with children, you create supervised accounts and monitor what children do online via a dashboard. You can also ban sites by name, or list only the sites you want your child to visit. The tool is rudimentary—there’s no switch to flip that automatically eliminates the nastiest of the Web, for instance—but it can be handy.A new Acer Chromebook 14, with a 14-inch screen and, according to its maker, 12 hours of battery life, is made with sturdy, lightweight aluminum and packs enough power for smooth Web work. It sells for $300.A Chromebook still can’t run some very common software. Minecraft, the insanely popular construction-and-adventure game, is now also a classroom tool. Chromebook’s inability to access it came up as a deal breaker for several families I spoke to.But Ms. Larcome, who has a work-issued MacBook Air, says even she would use a Chromebook at home. “None of the features I would need are missing.”She’ll have to be careful, though. If she starts using it too much, her daughter may have to ask her to kindly find her own computer.Write to Wilson Rothman at Wilson.Rothman@wsj.com or on Twitter @wjrothmanAppeared in the May 11, 2016, print edition as 'The Smart Way to Pick Your Child’s First Computer.'"

EMC Changes CIOs as Dell Pursues Acquisition,"Jan 11, 2016 2:33 pm ET","By Kim S. NashJan 11, 2016 2:33 pm ET0 COMMENTSEMC CIO ML Krakauer EMC CORP.ML Krakauer assumed the CIO role at EMC last week, after serving as executive vice president of business development for global enterprise services and, before that, head of global human resources.EMC is preparing to merge with Dell Inc., which in October announced a $67 billion deal to buy the company. Dell also made a CIO change recently, in November confirming that Paul J. Walsh was to leave the company. Mr. Walsh was promoted to CIO in 2014 and had also led Dell’s commerce services. Scott Pittman, who had been leading Dell’s IT infrastructure services, was named interim CIO while the company looks for a permanent replacement.The companies may draw on Ms. Krakauer’s integration experience at Compaq Computer Corp., when it was acquired by then-Hewlett-Packard Co. in 2002. She was a vice president and general manager in Compaq’s global services business when it was acquired by then-Hewlett-Packard Co. in 2002. She took a similar position at HP after the transaction, until she joined EMC in 2008. At EMC, she has also held executive positions in global services in recent years.As executive vice president of enterprise business solutions as well as CIO, Ms. Krakauer reports to EMC’s president and COO of global enterprise services, Howard Elias. She is “an influential EMC leader,” an EMC spokesman said in an email, “with extensive experience working with customers to design, implement, integrate, support and operate their IT environments.”Ms. Krakauer replaces Vic Bhagat, who left as EMC’s CIO “to pursue other opportunities,” the spokesman said. Mr. Bhagat joined EMC as CIO in 2013, after 20 years in IT at General Electric He did not immediately respond to a request for an interview."
Wall Street Focuses on Chesapeake CFO Following Co-Founder’s Indictment,"Mar 2, 2016 6:08 pm ET","By Tatyana ShumskyMar 2, 2016 6:08 pm ET0 COMMENTSEarth-moving machinery builds up a berm around a Chesapeake Energy storage tank, near Dilley, Texas, on May 16, 2011. PAT SULLIVAN/ASSOCIATED PRESSTumbling energy prices, cash shortfalls and ballooning debt have all combined to pose a daunting challenge for Chesapeake Energy Corp. finance chief Domenic Dell’Osso Jr. in recent years.Now, Wall Street’s eyes are focused on Mr. Dell’Osso following the Justice Department’s Tuesday indictment on antitrust charges of co-founder and former chief executive Aubrey McClendon, who died in a fiery high speed car crash Wednesday. Justice officials alleged Mr. McClendon orchestrated a campaign to keep down bids on land-lease deals from 2007 to 2012. Mr. McClendon, 56 years old, in a statement Tuesday had denied the charges.The controversy increases the pressure on a struggling company. In 2015, Chesapeake lost more than $14 billion and the company’s share price slumped 77%.As Chesapeake’s problems have mounted, so too has Mr. Dell’Osso’s importance, said Mark Hanson, analyst with Morningstar Inc. “It’s not so much about where you’re going to drill but how do you manage debt covenants, how do you manage debt maturity, cash flow shortages, asset sales, things like that,” Mr. Hanson said. Those issues are the purview of CFOs.Mr. Dell’Osso was named CFO in November 2010, when the energy company was still under Mr. McClendon’s leadership. WhileMr. McClendon was pushed out under shareholder pressure in 2013, Mr. Dell’Osso remained in his post. As one of the few people who could navigate the company’s complexity, Mr. Dell’Osso worked closely with the new CEO, Doug Lawler, to simplify the debt structure, analysts said.“Doug places a lot of confidence in Nick, or he wouldn’t have kept him around,” said Robert Morris, an energy sector analyst at Citigroup, adding that Mr. Lawler had replaced a lot of company management.“Nick was one of the few people he kept around,” Mr. Morris said.At the time, the company was struggling with large debt and spending more than it was earning. In 2012, 54% of Chesapeake’s projects hadn’t turned a profit and the company was offering employees access to tanning beds and Botox injections, The Wall Street Journal reported.The company did not immediately respond to phone calls and emailed requests for comment.Under Mr. Dell’Osso, the company has reduced its debt and its workforce, slashed capital spending and sold off assets to buttress its balance sheet. In December, Chesapeake offered investors in its existing bonds a deal under which it reduced the face value of the debt in exchange for bonds with a stronger claim on the company’s assets.The deal aimed to reduce Chesapeake’s roughly $11.6 billion debt by $1.5 billion without paying back the money.  “They were only able to do that because the people who owned the subordinated debt believed it wasn’t worth a dollar anymore,” said Barclay’s analyst Thomas Driscoll.Mr. Dell’Osso had worked as an energy investment banker at Jefferies & Co. and Banc of America Securities. prior to joining Chesapeake. That experience has likely given Mr. Dell’Osso an understanding of how to structure and execute complex deals, according to analysts.“He was probably at the helm of the debt exchange that they did in December,” said Mark Hanson, analyst with Morningstar Inc. “He’s dealing with a lot and he’s been doing it quite effectively,” he said.While overall company strategy is still likely set by Chesapeake’s Mr. Lawler, the finance chief’s role has grown more critical in recent years as oil prices plunged, squeezing the company’s balance sheet, analysts said. With less money coming in and debt piling up, the challenge for Mr. Dell’Osso has been to ensure the company can ride out the weak energy market without needing to repay any debt at an inconvenient time.“Typically the CFO’s job is to provide liquidity to fund the strategy,” said Barclay’s Mr. Driscoll. “It looks to me like they’ve been successful, from a financial standpoint.”"
Cybersecurity Firm SecureWorks Prices IPO Below Expectations,"Updated April 21, 2016 6:08 p.m. ET","By Maureen Farrell and Corrie DriebuschUpdated April 21, 2016 6:08 p.m. ET1 COMMENTSSecureWorks Corp. ended the drought of U.S. technology initial public offerings Thursday, but set a price for the shares that underscored continued weakness in the new-issue market.The cybersecurity arm of Dell Inc. priced its IPO at $14 apiece, raising $112 million through the sale of 8 million shares. It had targeted a sale of 9 million shares at $15.50 to $17.50 each.The share sale ended a four-month dearth of U.S. technology IPOs, the longest in seven years, but the disappointing pricing raised questions over whether others in the sector will follow suit.After a dismal first quarter, investors and other technology companies hoped SecureWorks would indicate that the IPO market is returning to health. To be sure, should the stock trade well Friday, it still could pave the way for other companies—both in and outside tech—to tap the public markets. It also would come on the heels of a few other successful offerings.There were hints that demand might be soft in the company’s so-called roadshow presentations for potential investors where it encountered skepticism due to its lack of profitability and the recent poor performance of rivals, according to people who were considering buying shares in the IPO.SecureWorks, the cybersecurity arm of Dell Inc., priced its IPO below expectations. Shown, a SecureWorks office in Myrtle Beach, S.C. PHOTO: BLOOMBERG NEWSThe first quarter was the slowest for U.S.-listed IPOs since 2009, hurt by a spasm of broader market uncertainty. The tech industry, traditionally the engine of the IPO market, has been hit particularly hard, in part by private-market valuations many investors see as inflated.But lately there have been signs of life.Shares of the first major company to debut this year, Bats Global Markets Inc., which started trading last Friday, are more than 20% above their IPO price even after underwriters priced them at the high end of their targeted range and added to the offering.MGM Growth Properties LLC, a real-estate investment trust that raised more than $1 billion, started trading Wednesday and closed up nearly 5% in its first day as a public company after pricing at the high end of its target range. Shares of the REIT are currently up 3.6% from their IPO price.The fact that SecureWorks shares managed to price at all is a victory of sorts. No other tech firm has listed shares in the U.S. since a small Chinese company did so in mid-December. That makes for the longest drought since the period between November 2008 and April 2009, according to Dealogic.READ MOREDell Faces High Cost to Fund EMC DealDell’s SecureWorks Aims to Launch IPO in April (April 1)Lackluster IPO Market Flashes Warning (March 31)Bats Shares Surge in Market Debut (April 15)MGM Growth Shares Climb in First Day of Trading (April 20)Part of the problem is that investors’ patience for loss-making companies has thinned. Many firms that tapped the IPO market early last year and in 2014 could find interest as long as they had a clear path to profits. That is no longer the case.A number of closely watched tech IPOs of the past two years are trading below their IPO prices, including Hortonworks Inc., Etsy Inc. and Box Inc.“The companies that go out in the near term are going to be profitable or have a near-term path to profitability,” said Kristin DeClark, head of technology equity capital markets at Deutsche Bank AG . Investors want assurance that a company is funded until it can break even and won’t be forced to tap the equity market again soon, she said.In its prospectus, SecureWorks warned potential investors that it has a history of losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability. The company had $72.4 million in net losses in fiscal 2016, compared with $38.5 million the year before.Cybersecurity stocks have performed poorly in 2016, continuing declines that began in the second half of last year.“Investors got overly excited” about cybersecurity stocks in 2014 and 2015 after a series of prominent data breaches, said Israel Hernandez, senior portfolio analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. The growth that was implied by the high valuations “didn’t quite materialize.”The cybersecurity ETF, PureFunds ISE Cyber Security Exchange-Traded Fund, has lost 9.2% in 2016.SecureWorks isn’t a perfect bellwether for the tech IPO market. It is different from many private tech companies in Silicon Valley, as it was founded during the last tech boom and is housed inside a large, established corporate parent.But a successful debut still could help break a logjam formed by many of those billion-dollar startups that have been waiting in the wings.Dell parent Denali Holding Inc. aimed to sell 9 million shares of SecureWorks in an offering that would have raised $149 million at the midpoint of the price range. The offering is part of an overhaul of the PC maker that includes its $67 billion pending acquisition of EMC Corp.SecureWorks will start trading Friday on the Nasdaq exchange under the symbol SCWX. The deal is being underwritten by a group of banks including Bank of America Corp. , Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and J.P.

"After Nearly $200 Million Dell Flub, T. Rowe Price Seeks a Solution","June 2, 2016 7:29 p.m. ET","The silhouette of Michael Dell, founder of Dell Inc., is seen during the 2015 Dell World Conference in Austin, Texas. PHOTO: BLOOMBERG NEWSBy Liz Hoffman andSarah KrouseJune 2, 2016 7:29 p.m. ET27 COMMENTSAfter a nearly $200 million blunder, one of America’s largest mutual-fund companies is racing to find a way to compensate thousands of clients.T. Rowe Price Group Inc . TROW -3.06% is likely to announce as early as next week a plan to reimburse clients who lost out when it accidentally voted in favor of the 2013 buyout of Dell Inc. by its founder Michael Dell, according to people familiar with the matter.T. Rowe had vocally opposed the deal, saying it undervalued the 30 million Dell shares held by its mutual funds. But a series of administrative errors caused the firm to vote in favor of the deal, disqualifying it from suing for more money. Other holders successfully sued and won compensation from a judge, who ruled earlier this week that Mr. Dell and his partners underpaid by $6 billion.Such a misstep is rare and embarrassing for the Baltimore-based firm, one the biggest managers of U.S. retirement assets and a major holder of S&P 500 companies. T. Rowe had $764.6 billion in assets under management at the end of March.MOREJudge Finds Michael Dell, Silver Lake Underpaid for Dell in 2013Trading and other operational missteps can happen at mutual-fund firms, but voting errors on major deals like this one are unusual. T. Rowe’s costly mistake highlights how the largely automated proxy voting process is vulnerable to human error. The company launched a review of its internal voting procedures, according to a person familiar with the matter.There is no guarantee that the compensation plan will be completed, and the final form it could take is still being discussed, the people added.“We are in the process of reviewing the opinions and considering our options,” a T. Rowe spokesman said Thursday.T. Rowe investors stand to miss out on roughly $190 million—about $4 a share, plus interest, on some 30 million Dell shares held across several of its funds. The payment package could head off potentially costly lawsuits from disgruntled fund investors and any potential inquiries from regulators.The T. Rowe fund investors are arguably worse off than Dell investors who knowingly voted to accept the $13.75-a-share deal consideration back in 2013. Those shareholders were paid immediately when the deal closed in October 2013. But because T. Rowe sued to challenge the deal price, its fund investors had to wait more than two years for payment.The money manager has blamed its vote in favor of the deal on a back-office error. The default stance of T. Rowe in merger votes—like many large investors—is to support management, which in Dell’s case recommended in favor of the deal. So T. Rowe Price’s computerized system spit out instructions to vote “yes” that weren't manually overridden before the final vote, according to court filings.T. Rowe held Dell shares in a number of its mutual funds including the Equity Income fund and the Science and Technology fund in 2013. The Equity Income fund is up 6.27% over three years, compared with an 11.11% return for its benchmark, the S&P 500, according to Morningstar Inc., while the Science and Technology fund returned 15.85% over three years, ahead of a 5.17% benchmark return.T. Rowe publicly filed a record of some 2013 fund proxy votes, including the fateful Dell ballot, in August of 2014, as all large investors must do annually. But T. Rowe said in court that it didn’t become aware of the voting error until two months later, when an analyst asked why it had voted in favor of the deal, according to court filings.In February 2013, just a week after the buyout was announced, T. Rowe joined a chorus of investors who argued it was unfair. While T. Rowe is typically more vocal than its competitors, mutual funds rarely speak out publicly on corporate mergers. Its opposition lengthened the deal’s odds of passage.Mr. Dell eventually agreed to raise the price by 10 cents a share, and shareholders approved the deal. Soon after, T. Rowe and a handful of other disgruntled investors filed for a so-called court “appraisal,” asking a judge to determine the fair value for Dell’s stock.Dell challenged T. Rowe’s standing to sue after the voting snafu was uncovered. T. Rowe argued in court that it had never taken “deliberate, affirmative action” to vote in favor of the merger. And documents produced during the trial showed that Dell’s advisers had marked T. Rowe down in the “against” camp as they tallied votes in the lead-up to a hotly contested meeting.T. Rowe’s mistake is partly attributable to the complexities of both the way shareholder votes are cast and the twists and turns of the Dell deal itself. Ahead of the first scheduled vote, in July 2013, T. Rowe governance chief Donna Anderson manually overrode the default “for” vote, and T. Rowe’s votes were logged as against the transaction, according to court filings.But when the deal was renegotiated, the vote was postponed, and T. Rowe’s instructions were effectively vacated. The firm did not override the default “for” election when the vote was later held, according to court filings.“Asset managers in general, particularly active managers, typically take a hands-on approach to these shareholder votes,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of exchange-traded-fund and mutual-fund research at S&P Global Market Intelligence. “Voting mistakes like this are few and far between.”One of the biggest beneficiaries of this week’s court ruling was silent as the debate over the buyout raged. Hedge fund Magnetar Capital LLC stands to pocket about $25 million in profits.Most of the investors who voiced opposition to the buyout either voted to accept the deal price or sold their shares before voting. They include billionaire activist Carl Icahn, who led a charge for an alternative buyout plan, and his partner Southeastern Asset Management Inc., a longtime Dell holder.Mr. Icahn said he opted not to sue, a decision that cost him as much as $1 billion, because he had “better uses” for his cash. Around the same time, Mr. Icahn took a stake in Apple Inc., a trade the outspoken investor said ultimately delivered around $2 billion in profits.Write to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com and Sarah Krouse at sarah.krouse@wsj.comAppeared in the June 3, 2016, print edition as 'After Flub, Investment Firm Seeks A Solution.'"

"Pure Storage Rising: Settlement with EMC a Positive, Says Wells","Oct. 19, 2016 2:23 p.m. ET","Shares of pioneer Pure Storage (PSTG) are up 42 cents, or 3.4%, at $12.65, after the company this morning announced that it settled all outstanding litigation with EMC, now a part of privately held Dell.The dispute dates back to 2013, when EMC accused Pure of infringing on five patents for ""flash array"" technology. Subsequent claims followed from EMC, including an accusation that Pure had hired EMC employees to take EMC customer relationships. Pure countersued.Pure's comments today were brief, disclosing $30 million as the settlement paid to EMC:On October 18, 2016, Pure Storage, Inc. and Dell Inc., as successor-in-interest to EMC Corporation, entered into an agreement to settle all litigation between Pure Storage and EMC. The specific terms of the settlement are confidential, but include a payment of $30 million to Dell, the dismissal of all litigation between the parties, mutual releases, and a license to the disputed patent.Based on what I can see from Pure's public filings, it would appear there aren't any other outstanding actions at this time of the scale and scope of the EMC suits.Wells Fargo's Maynard Um, who has a Market Perform rating on Pure shares, and a $12 to $14 ""valuation range,"" writes in a note to clients that settlement sum ""seems reasonable based on a previous jury award to EMC of $14MM for infringement from the FlashArray 400 Series and predecessor products and then adding PSTG's FlashArray//m products.""He adds that ""the $30MM payment represents 5% of PSTG's cash and marketable securities ($570.3MM).""Um concludes that ""the settlement removes the overhang of litigation of both the patent and trade secret cases and the risk of higher opex associated with legal proceedings, which previously impacted the company’s financials.""There will likely be ""a cash impact in FQ4,"" he writes, but it's ""a non-issue unless there are gross margin implications and view the lift of the overhang, particularly related to opex, as positive."""

She previously was CIO at Dell Inc.Mr. Griffiths joined Biogen from Dell in December 2014 as vice president of pharmaceutical operations and corporate information technology. He was named CIO the following May, reporting to Ms. Karaboutis.In May 2015, Ms. Karaboutis told CIO Journal the company agreed Mr. Griffiths was “the one that has the fire in the belly to drive the IT organization forward.”As CIO, he was tasked with developing Biogen’s enterprise IT strategy, including global application development and infrastructure. He also was picked to help Ms. Karaboutis use advanced analytics to determine why certain classes of people are stricken with multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord.Prior to joining Biogen, Mr. Griffiths spent more than a decade at Dell in technology roles spanning manufacturing, supply chain and IT infrastructure.Biogen, one of the world’s largest biopharmaceutical companies, last year cut 11% of its workforce, more than 800 employees, as part of a broad restructuring plan that came amid slowing sales growth for Tecfidera, its flagship multiple-sclerosis drug.

The firm also sees the potential for analytics to speed up drug discovery.Biogen shares fell more than 12% Tuesday after the company said one of its most closely watched experimental drugs failed to improve the health of multiple sclerosis patients in a mid-stage study, a setback for the company’s new product pipeline, the Journal reported.Write to steven.norton@wsj.com"
"VMware Has Upside Beyond the Tracking Stock, Says Gabelli","Updated June 10, 2016 1:50 p.m. ET","Gabelli & Co. analyst Hendi Susanto today writes that there are positive things in store for VMware (VMW) once it gets past the pending acquisition of EMC (EMC), its majority shareholder, by privately held Dell.EMC is expected to have a special shareholder meeting on July 19th to vote on the Dell proposal, and the deal is expected to close by October, according to EMC management, notes Susanto.By way of background, Dell is offering to pay EMC holders $24.05 in cash and 0.111of a  share of a newly issued VMware tracking stock for every EMC share, notes Susanto. That tracking stock, assumes Susanto, may trade at about 20% discount to VMware “class A” common stock.VMware stock is up from its lows, he notes, at a recent price of $64, indeed it is 47% from its 52-week low.As a consequence, ""We see some possibility that shortly after the Dell EMC transaction, some investors, especially merger arbitrage fund investors, may unload and sell their VMware tracking stock and, therefore, the discount on the tracking stock can be higher than anticipated.""But beyond that unloading of the tracking stock, there may be several positive developments in store for VMware holders, especially as it buys back its stock, he writes:VMware is planning to execute all its new $1.2 billion of share repurchase authorization in 2016. The share repurchase will take place after the completion of Dell-EMC transaction because of legal and regulatory constraints. VMware will buy back its own shares, not Dell’s tracking stock. Assuming that the Dell EMC transaction may close as early as late July, the time window for the share repurchase may span up to about five months. The share buyback should support VMware market price and owners of VMware tracking shares may not want to unload their ownership if the discount is larger than desired. There are 424 million total VMware shares outstanding including 124 million of VMware class A shares. With VMware share at $64 per share, the $1.2 billion of share repurchase translates into 18.6 million shares, about 15% of total VMware class A shares and 4% of total outstanding shares.

Nutanix’s CEO: What Would an Amazon Partnership Look Like?,"Nov. 30, 2016 11:58 a.m. ET","Shares of enterprise infrastructure equipment maker Nutanix (NTNX), which went public September 30th, are down $1.37, or 4%, at $32.72, despite the company yesterday beating fiscal Q1 expectations, and forecasting this quarter higher, too, results that pleased analysts but not enough to please traders.A big focus on the conference call following the report were the two areas where the company said it had done especially well, those being with the U.S. federal business, and in its sales of software to OEM systems manufactures, especially Dell, where it has a longstanding partnership.I spoke with CEO Dheeraj Pandey a short while ago by phone. I had first talked with Pandey in his San Jose offices in mid-2014, when Nutanix was a privately backed startup. Pandey is always pleasantly outspoken. Back then, he told me that there had been ""$200 million in venture money dedicated to killing Nutanix.""His thoughts during today’s conversations were more philosophical than back then. He spoke about the company’s goal to merge public cloud computing with on-premise computing. Pandey regards his firm as more than a mere box-maker, like Pure Storage (PSTG) or NetApp (NTAP). Instead, it is designing the “operating system” to span from an enterprise’s facilities to public cloud installations running in Amazon.com (AMZN) AWS, with the company’s believing that “hybrid” cloud environments will dominate for the foreseeable future.However, Nutanix right now sells mostly to enterprise customers, including those deals with Dell. Less than 10% of revenue has been to service providers. And it doesn’t have a deal with Amazon, which I suggested to him means the company’s not selling as much to one half of the public-private cloud divide.But Pandey points out it’s very early in the evolution of public cloud. “Today, there is only one real public cloud company, which is Amazon,” he observes. “[Microsoft’s (MSFT)] Azure is not at that scale yet, and [Alphabet’s (GOOGL)] Google is doing a lot of marketing. This is a five- to ten-year journey till we know who real the real providers are.""In the same vein, he notes that Amazon alone can’t address the needs of the “Fortune 5,000” companies that make up 80% of global IT spending.But, I pressed, is it possible for him to do a partnership with Amazon?Pandey replied, ""That question is quite nuanced — What would a win-win look like?""He continued that it’s not clear much of AWS is actually used by customers:These are all things we will explore in the future. I don’t know all the details of the VMware/AWS deal, but basically, it’s [AWS] mostly Amazon renting hardware to VMware, and it’s quite topical at best. You have to really go deeper into using Amazon’s capabilities. There are a ton of capabilities within the operating system that I’m not sure VMware is going to use as part of this colocation or hosting they are offering. What about networks and security? Are you able, if you have an Amazon ID, to use that Amazon ID across both sides, both public and on-premise?There are no ratings changes on the Street today, that I can see, but some price target increases, here and there. In addition to lots of praise for the company’s work, the biggest concern for analysts is the current reliance on the Dell partnership, along with quibbles about stock valuation:Richard Kugele, Needham & Co.: Reiterates a Buy rating, and a $36 price target. “In its first quarter as a public company, Nutanix did not disappoint, materially exceeding topline revenue, billings and EPS loss estimates. Further, NTNX raised next quarter's guidance vs. consensus, demonstrating continued momentum. In our view, the only thing the company potentially did wrong was report earnings as a public company, as it appears to be in vogue to find some real or imagined fault with next-gen tech companies regardless of how well they are actually executing. We strongly contest this view, as we believe these stocks ultimately revert to growth and fundamentals over time.""Nepal Chokshi, Maxim Group: Reiterates a Buy rating, and raises his price target to $42 from $40. ""October quarter results deliver 5th quarter in a row of y/y improving sales productivity to a phenomenal level, in our view […] The only potential issue investors can take with the earnings report in our view is the rise in DSOs, which based on our AR/billings DSO metric rose 21 days y/y and 6 days q/q. Management noted that billings linearity was similar to the past two fiscal first quarters, but that linearity of shipments did not mimic billings as a result of not managing the supplier relationships crisply towards the end of the quarter.Mark Murphy, J.P. Morgan: Reiterates a Neutral rating, and raises his price target to $35 from $33. ""In its first quarter as a public company, Nutanix reported impressive results with an accelerating revenue profile that beat expectations across all metrics and provided guidance above consensus […] We are very encouraged by the results and we expect Nutanix to continue to upend the IT infrastructure playbook, however, we think the risk/reward is fairly balanced for now at current price levels.""Mehdi Hosseini, Susquehanna: Reiterates a Neutral rating, and raises his price target to $29 from $24. ""We came away encouraged with NTNX's strong October-quarter top-line results and January-quarter guide - as well as promising cash flow dynamics; however, we remain Neutral at current levels given the confluence of appropriate valuation, potential risk from an intensifying competitive environment and the prospect of a de-emphasized Dell OEM relationship combined with NTNX's aggressive opex strategy.""Simon Leopold, Raymond James: Reiterates a Market Perform rating. ""Although bookings were not disclosed, management noted that software content now makes up 15% of bookings, up from 9% in the year ago quarter, implying that OEM contributions to bookings are likely up materially as well given that 66% of OEM bookings are software. Management has stated in the past that despite the growing OEM contribution to bookings, it expects OEM revenue will remain less than 20% of total sales. Investors will likely remain cautious however as the continually increasing contributions to bookings from one its own competitors will likely remain a point of focus."""

In Short Supply at Hong Kong Startups: Job Candidates,"Jun 30, 2016 9:33 am HKT","Jun 30, 2016 9:33 am HKT0 COMMENTSIn Hong Kong, it can be hard for startups to find the right people. PHOTO: BLOOMBERG NEWSWhat’s the biggest challenge for Hong Kong startups? Hint: It’s not the rent.Ask people who have founded technology businesses here to name their greatest obstacle, and they’ll talk about “culture,” “ecosystems,” and “communities.” Often what they mean is, they just can’t get the staff.It appears to be a particularly Hong Kong phenomenon.“Working for a startup is seen as what you do when you can’t get a job,” said Andrew Kwan, the founder of Outwhiz, a company that uses technology to tackle the problem of student motivation.In Silicon Valley, people leave firms like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and McKinsey & Co. to work for a startup, and just across the border from Hong Kong in Shenzhen, young people pour in to join or found startups right out of school. In Hong Kong, Mr. Kwan said, people work for a startup if they can’t find work at a well-known company.“I had a great intern,” said Priscilla Dell’Orto, co-founder of Fab Pros, which she describes as the Uber of beauty professionals. “His dad told him to get a proper job.”The latest poll of Hong Kong University graduates shows that nearly 27% went into business services and financial institutions in 2014, slightly higher that the figure for 2013.Family pressure contributes to a tricky startup environment. Young people in Hong Kong are often in frequent contact with a large extended family, and the family wants to know what they’re up to.“Entrepreneurship is discouraged in Hong Kong, it’s risky,” said Theodore Ma, the managing partner of Cocoon, which provides shared office space in Hong Kong. “There is pressure from family and friends to get out of startups”To be sure, rent is a problem for people starting their own companies. Real estate in Hong Kong is among the most expensive in the world, according to several studies. The latest government data show domestic rent prices falling, while the cost of office space continues to rise.Cocoon and other co-working spaces such as “The Loft” offer possible solutions, and there are the typical budget options for technology startups.“Two people with a laptop can go to Starbucks,” said Mr. Kwan. “If you need to hustle, you can work in the library.”A third challenge for startups in Hong Kong is raising money, but a traditional dearth of funds willing to take a risk on new businesses is slowly being eroded by new investors such as the Alibaba Hong Kong Entrepreneurs Fund and Horizon Ventures, set up by the city’s richest man, Li Ka-shing.  Alibaba.com’s HK$1 billion ($128.9 million) fund recently invested in the e-commerce site Shopline, which started out in Cocoon’s office space.In Shenzhen, startups have more fundraising opportunities even during an economic slowdown, because venture capitalists from Beijing and Shanghai consider Shenzhen to be one of China’s premier startup hubs.Cocoon itself is trying to raise $10 million to invest in Hong Kong startups, and runs events where entrepreneurs compete to catch the eye of investors and possible mentors.Startups need space, said Erica Ma, the other co-founder of Cocoon, “but also people. Engineers, designers, investors.”“It’s hard to hire engineers,” said Thierry Coustillac, co-founder of Letsguang, which provides software to Chinese malls. In Hong Kong, “if you have a computer-science degree, you’d rather make 40k working for HSBC than 15k working for a startup.”“Rent is crazy,” said Ms. Dell’Orto, the founder of Fab Pros, but her greatest headache at the moment? “Developers.”– Laurence Witherington.

Serverless Computing Heats Up as Pivotal Software Takes on Cloud Giants,"Dec 15, 2016 5:39 pm ET","By Sara CastellanosDec 15, 2016 5:39 pm ET2 COMMENTSJames Watters, senior vice president of products for Pivotal, says the boom in internet-connected devices has fueled the growth in event-based cloud computing. PHOTO: PIVOTAL SOFTWAREPivotal Software Inc., part of the privately-held tech giant that emerged from Dell Inc.’s acquisition of EMC Corp., plans to compete with Amazon Inc.’s Amazon Web Services and other major cloud providers in the next evolution of cloud computing.In this new era, physical and virtual servers that are traditionally used to run certain applications become invisible to the developers building apps because the servers are owned and managed by a cloud provider. This is a trend commonly referred to as serverless computing, pioneered by AWS in 2014 with the launch of its Lambda offering. It frees developers from having to manage servers and allows them to focus on writing code.Part of the appeal of serverless computing is also economic, because the customer only pays for certain applications when they’re executed, which is possible because the apps aren’t being run on a customer’s server.Pivotal, majority-owned by the new Dell Technologies Inc., is now joining a field of new entrants in the market with Spring Cloud Function, its version of serverless computing that’s expected to launch in mid-2017.Pivotal executives say its new feature could open up the potential for new kinds of services and applications, such as narrowly-written, single-purpose apps that are triggered by specific events.In practice, this might allow a large bank to send a notification to a customer whose mobile banking app is detected in another country, asking whether they want to activate the use of their credit card in that location, said James Watters, senior vice president of products for Pivotal.Before, there was no software application that could be triggered specifically for that purpose, and the bank didn’t have a way to use only the compute power needed to “fire and expire” that application, Mr. Watters said.“The idea is that there’s a brand new way of application developers and enterprises enriching their apps … and interacting with customers,” he said.Pivotal will follow in the footsteps of several cloud providers who are offering this type of service, which allows developers at enterprises to write software applications that can be executed on a cloud provider’s server only when a specific event, or piece of code, is triggered.By 2020 the use of serverless computing will become part of an enterprise’s strategy as they look to make the best use of public cloud infrastructure, according to a September report from research firm Gartner Inc.Mr. Watters said the boom in internet-connected devices has fueled the growth in event-based cloud computing because the software applications for those devices require massive amounts of requests of short duration.Enterprise customers or IT departments only pay for each time the code is executed, instead of doling out cash up front for physical or virtual servers traditionally used to run applications, which they may end up not needing.“When you have these bursty, episodic events where you suddenly need to take a bunch of actions, but it’s not worth having all that capacity turned on, that’s great motivation for doing this,” Mr. Watters said.With Spring Cloud Function, software developers write applications in Spring Cloud Services, its cloud-based programming platform. Pivotal Cloud Foundry runs the code either on its cloud or the clouds of other providers it partners with, such as Microsoft Azure.Enterprises will license Pivotal’s software and will be billed by the cloud provider they’re using whenever a code is triggered.Lambda, by contrast, manages the developer’s code and runs it on AWS’s own servers, billing the customer for every millisecond that a code is triggered, AWS has said previously. AWS declined to comment for this story.Other companies that have recently launched serverless computing competitors to AWS Lambda include Microsoft Corp.’s Azure Functions, released a month ago, and Google Cloud Functions, which debuted earlier this year in a test with limited customers.As businesses continue their migration to the cloud, serverless computing will become a permanent feature of cloud services, analysts have said previously.Michael Dell, CEO of Dell Technologies, which was formed in the wake of Dell Inc.’s $60 billion deal to acquire EMC Corp., told the WSJ in September that the evolution of cloud computing would be an “attractive” area of investment."
"Nutanix: Yes, They Can Survive the Dell Relationship, Says Maxim","Updated April 12, 2017 7:58 p.m. ET","Maxim Group’s Nehal Chokshi today reiterated a Buy rating on shares of “hyper-converged” enterprise infrastructure provider Nutanix (NTNX), and a $42 price target, writing that the company has a chance to “redirect” sales that its partner Dell is trying to shift away from it.Nutanix has for some time now had a partnership with Dell, a unit of the holding company Dell Technologies (DVMT), via which its products are sold more broadly.There has been consistent worry about Dell, which makes up 10% of Nutanix’s sales, being a risk should Dell focus more on its own wares, and some have argued the company can move away from Dell over time.Chockshi takes an optimistic view, writes that Nutanix can “re-direct” the “sales funnel,” taking leads it has been giving to Dell and instead using them to sell its own hardware, or that of its other partner, Lenovo Group (0992HK), rather than the leads being used by Dell to sell software from VMware (VMW), in which Dell Technologies maintains a majority stake.""Qualitatively, the key variable is whether the NTNX-generated leads being funneled into DELL that are being lost to VxRail can be re-directed,” writes Chockshi, ""from DELL hardware and support to either Lenovo hardware and support and/or NTNX branded hardware and support.""He offers reasons why Nutanix can do it:Why we believe NTNX will be able to accomplish the sale funnel re-direction: 1) The superior scalability and elasticity of the Nutanix Distributed File System relative to VxRack, which is especially important with large enterprises. 2) The app centric hybrid cloud vision NTNX has defined and will likely detail on a more technical level at .NEXT in late June, we believe will likely prove more cost effective with better performance than VMW's hypervisor centric hybrid cloud strategy (see Figure 1 below). a) Our DELL-specific checks also indicate VMW's hybrid cloud vision is weak and that MSFT's hybrid cloud capabilities stand above all others. b) Per DELL’s analyst day, we note that EMC does not see VMW's hybrid cloud vision as complete, as the company has defined Virtustream to be the EMC platform best suited for mission critical applications and Pivotal as best suited for ""born in the cloud"" apps.At the current share price, Chockshi thinks Nutanix stock is predicting the company will fail to re-direct those leads, and so it doesn't reflect his optimistic scenario.Using a metric called ""sales productivity,"" which is equal to sales and marketing expense dividend by the company's bookings, he explains the stock valuation:We further note that current consensus implies our sales productivity metric will stabilize at the 32% level (vs. FY16 level of 24.4% and high end of target range of 29%-32%) in FY18 and if we were to extend the 32% sales productivity ratio to our terminal period, would then yield a $20/share fair value (corresponds to terminal period revenue of $3.4B and a 14% FCF margin). In other words, we believe NTNX at $18/share reflects the sell- side consensus estimates, which was largely set by NTNX management to what we believe will ultimately prove to be a conservative set of estimates.Nutanix shares today closed up 10 cents, or 0.6%, at $17.79."
"Nutanix: Big Competiton from Dell Makes it a Sell, Says Summit","Jan. 12, 2017 3:54 p.m. ET","Shares of storage and compute upstart Nutanix (NTNX) are up 4 cents at $30 despite a negative piece today from Summit Redstone’s Srini Nandury, who reiterates a Sell rating on the stock, predicting heightened competition from privately held Dell.“Competition is closer than many believe,” writes Nandury.He cites in particular an announcement this week by Dell, at an event held by Citrix Systems (CTXS), of new versions of its “VxRail” server systems.Nutanix is the “market leader” in what’s called ""hyper-converged infrastructure,” or HCI, and has “single-handedly pioneered” its adoption, in enterprise, writes Nandury.Dell has had an agreement to resell Nutanix’s equipment, but one of the worries has always been that Dell could also be a competitor. In my interview with Dell’ s CFO, Tom Sweet, back on December 8th, Sweet told me that ""Nutanix has been a good partner for us,” but he also added that “We try to offer our customers choice,” and so, “We also provide VXrail and VXrax,” home-grown Dell products.Nandury notes the VxRail announcement by Dell:Dell/EMC introduced a set of VxRail products for storage heavy workloads such as Big Data and Microsoft Exchange and Graphics heavy workloads such as CAD/CAM previously, and these machines have been certified for Citrix VDI deployments. Interestingly, the graphics heavy workloads are powered by Nvidia Tesla GPUs. PowerEdge servers are considered some of the best in the industry and are highly configurable giving buyers the option to vary the amounts of memory/storage or CPU for IO centric or compute heavy applications.This is a big threat to Nutanix, he thinks:We believe Dell/EMC/VMware will continue to ratchet up the competition given that ONE company owns – servers, storage, networking and software under one roof. With all parts of the HCI solution housed under one roof, we believe Dell can accelerate the pace of innovation delivering solid products faster than what Nutanix can deliver. Further, any new hardware improvement in servers would first be delivered to its own products before they will be delivered to Nutanix. With Dell’s vaunted supply chain efficiency, we believe any savings Dell accrues will be quickly delivered back to customers, making Dell’s products cheaper. We also believe this leaves Nutanix at a significant disadvantage.Nandury also provides an infographic of the companies competing with Nutanix, according to Forrester research:"
"Nutanix Evolving Beyond Dell Relationship, Says Pacific Crest","Jan. 17, 2017 3:55 p.m. ET","Pacific Crest’s Alex Kurtz today reiterates an Overweight rating on shares of enterprise infrastructure equipment maker Nutanix (NTNX), and a $38 price target, writing that his his recent discussions with the company’s chief financial officer were encouraging as far as the market opportunity.Kurtz spoke with CFO Duston Williams and also chief marking officer Howard Ting, along with a group of investors, and came away with the impression that the company is taking steps that could offset some of its reliance on privately held Dell, which sells Nutanix equipment and has made up 10% of sales.Kurtz writes that he’s been expecting Nutanix’s product sales growth to decelerate from 75% in 2016 to 59% this year, and just 33% next year.But, he writes, there are three things that could offset that:We expect the Lenovo partnership could backfill sales disruption and expect other future OEM opportunities given the software/OEM model Nutanix has built. 2. We believe EMC's sales organization is positioning VxRail outside of the core data center, as outlined below in Exhibit 1. We believe EMC has done so in large part to avoid cannibalizing existing converged infrastructure products, like VxBlock, as well as standalone VMAX, XtremIO and VNX platforms, which have larger deal-size opportunities and are known to be stable platforms for tier-1 applications. 3. It now appears EMC reps could receive quota relief and commission on selling Nutanix in the near term. Nutanix management would argue that their deal size versus VxRail could be larger because of greater scalability features for larger environments, which could make Nutanix a more attractive solution to legacy EMC reps.Kurtz also describes how he sees the company going after “Fortune 2000” business, meaning large companies, more directly:Management noted recent sales leadership hires will focus on a more layered (and possibly direct) approach to the Global 2000, where we project greater than 70% of traditional IT spending is concentrated. Global 2000 follow-on spending with Nutanix is 2x greater than in the rest of the business, with the Global 2000 spending 7.3x per initial $1 spent with Nutanix versus the corporate average at 3.9x. Management also noted the recent hire from EMC (Kaddaras) to run EMEA is in part to accelerate the penetration in several countries like the United Kingdom and Germany."

The Woman Behind Howard Stern,"May 1, 2017 5:53 p.m. ET","Marci Turk and Howard Stern. Ms. Turk is chief operating officer of Mr. Stern’s radio operations PHOTO: GETTY IMAGES (2)By Joe FlintMay 1, 2017 5:53 p.m. ET105 COMMENTSShe is rarely mentioned on-air. She doesn’t have a funny nickname like producer Gary Dell’Abate’s “ Baba Booey ” nor is she endlessly teased and tormented like staff writer Benjy Bronk. Not even many longtime listeners know her name.But to anyone close to Howard Stern, the self-proclaimed king of all media, Marci Turk is “The Howard Whisperer.” The chief operating officer of Mr. Stern’s Sirius XM Satellite radio operations, Ms. Turk has become something of a gatekeeper to the radio star and one of his most trusted advisers.As Mr. Stern tries to broaden his appeal and soften his image, some fans are complaining Ms. Turk has cleaned up the shock jock and made him safe for the kind of celebrities he used to mock. With Mr. Stern devoting more of his show to being a serious interviewer, Ms. Turk is often accused in chat rooms of making him more politically correct. In February, for example, Mr. Stern spent 90 minutes interviewing “Girls” star and creator Lena Dunham who later called him a “feminist.” Musician Sheryl Crow and actor Steve Martin have been guests. Lengthy celebrity interviews mean less time for his usual high jinks.Producer Gary Dell’Abate, known as Baba Booey to listeners, with Craig Ferguson, left, and Alyssa Milano, center, during a Feb. 3 show. PHOTO: CINDY ORD/GETTY IMAGESMr. Stern mentioned Ms. Turk on air two weeks ago in a diatribe at listeners who miss the old Howard. “The new thing from the people who now hate me is, ‘oh Howard changed because of Marci Turk … he got this woman in there and she calls the shots on the show and she won’t let him do this or that,’ ” Mr. Stern said on his April 19 show. The show’s subjects, he continued are “where I want to go.”“It seems like all the drama around her has to do with the longstanding Howard Stern aficionados,” says Eric Sherman, a longtime talent manager whose clients have included Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler, who has often appeared on the show. “Under her watch, he has excelled,” he adds.Mr. Stern, Ms. Turk and Mr. Dell’Abate didn’t respond to requests for comment.The 63-year-old Mr. Stern has two Sirius satellite radio channels. Howard 100 carries his now three-days-a-week program; Howard 101 is primarily a highlight reel, featuring shows going as far back as his days at WXRK-FM New York in the 1980s and 1990s. Sirius has over 31 million subscribers but doesn’t break out Mr. Stern’s audience. However he is their biggest star.RELATED READINGMore from The Wall Street JournalThe 365 Days of Summer Movies (April 27, 2017)How Many Times Did You Eat Breakfast Today? (April 25, 2017)Knead Slime?

She has been working with Mr. Stern since 2012. At that time, Mr. Stern was growing frustrated with managing all the details of his show, people close to him say. He had recently joined the NBC show “America’s Got Talent” as a judge.Mr. Stern also was seeking to elevate his show and create a friendly atmosphere for lengthy interviews with actors and musicians. He has said on-air that he had gone just about as far as he could go interviewing a steady stream of strippers and adult-film stars.So Mr. Stern called David Allen, author of “Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity” and asked for help.“He contacted our offices directly and asked, ‘hey do you have any coaches,’ ” says Mr. Allen, who directed him to Ms. Turk who had been working out of David Allen Co.’s New York office. Ms. Turk was a good fit, Mr. Allen says, because “she’s smart, savvy, classy, hip and fast.”Howard Stern mentioned Ms. Turk during an April 19 show, which was unusual. PHOTO: DARIO CANTATORE/GETTY IMAGESIn December 2012, Mr. Stern summoned his staff to an auditorium in the McGraw Hill building in Midtown Manhattan, which is home to Sirius XM. Mr. Stern berated his staff for not getting his show to the next level, people in attendance say.“He yelled at everybody about a dress code and literally referred to staff looking like homeless people,” one person who was there recalls.Ms. Turk didn’t attend, but Mr. Stern mentioned that he was bringing her on in a senior role. That led to an awkward moment when Mr. Dell’Abate, the longtime executive producer of the show raised his hand and asked if he would now report to her instead of him after nearly 30 years. Mr. Stern paused and said, “Actually Gary you do,” according to another attendee.Ms. Turk moved to lead outreach to bigger stars and their publicists to entice them to come on the show and convince them it was a safe environment. Behind the scenes, Ms. Turk had the “green room” where guests wait to be interviewed redone. Goofy photos of staffers were taken down in favor of more show-friendly art. Guests received gift baskets for appearing. Staffers were no longer allowed to use the green room as a recreation room.During his April 19 show, Mr. Stern said he had strippers and naked women on for years and “you’ve got to constantly change up the show and constantly work on what you find funny.”Write to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.comAppeared in the May 2, 2017, print edition as 'The Woman behind howard stern stern.'"

U.S. Firms Slash Interest Tab in $100 Billion Refinancing Blitz,"Updated Feb. 8, 2017 7:22 a.m. ET","Blackstone owns Service King Collision Repair Centers PHOTO: BRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERSBy Matt WirzUpdated Feb. 8, 2017 7:22 a.m. ET8 COMMENTSRising interest-rate expectations are fueling the biggest corporate-refinancing boom in years.U.S. companies refinanced $100 billion of loans in January, the largest monthly total in at least a decade, according to data from S&P Global Inc. SPGI -2.32% More than 110 low-rated companies, including software giant Dell Technologies Inc. and car-repair chain Service King Collision Repair Centers Inc., have refinanced loans since October, according to data from LevFin Insights LLC.Borrowers in recent months have saved more than $1 billion in annual interest costs by renegotiating terms with their lenders, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of the data.The wave is being propelled by outsize investor demand for bank loans, floating-rate debt investments that are prized because they tend to perform well in rising-rate environments. The red-hot loan market has enabled many corporations to demand that lenders cut rates or face losing the business to a rival, a sign of how easy financing is enabling large firms to get advantageous terms in debt markets.Persuading lenders to cut the rate on Service King’s $609 million loan by 0.75 percentage point took just a few days. The new loan will save the company about $4.5 million in annual interest expense that can be used for acquisitions instead, said Chief Financial Officer Michelle Frymire.“There’s a lot of pent-up investor demand,” Ms. Frymire said. The Richardson, Texas, company has 309 auto repair shops in 23 states and is owned by private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP.Unlike bonds, most of which pay a fixed interest rate until they mature, loans pay floating interest rates calculated as a premium, or “spread,” over the London interbank offered rate. Interest climbs with benchmark rates, typically making the loans more attractive to investors and more expensive for borrowers, when the Federal Reserve increases rates.Reflecting immense demand for the loans, borrowing costs are actually dropping at present. The risk is that the feeding frenzy pushes spreads so low that investors no longer earn enough income to offset the risk of default. Yet with U.S. and global economic activity showing signs of warming up, defaults remain low and few analysts are concerned that a recession is imminent.Investors have poured $17 billion into loan mutual funds since Sept. 1, with $7.6 billion coming in December alone, according to data from Lipper Inc. It is the biggest such inflow since 2013, during the “Taper Tantrum” when the Fed’s plan to reduce stimulus fueled a surge into loan funds.With few new loans to buy, fund managers who received new money from investors are scrambling to buy existing loans, pushing prices higher and spreads down. Companies and their investment bankers saw the opportunity to refinance and pounced.“Animal spirits seem to have taken over investor appetite and the markets,” said Craig Russ, co-manager of Eaton Vance Corp.’s $7.5 billion leveraged-loan mutual fund.While large banks still underwrite large corporate loans, they often sell the bulk of the debt to a mix of mutual funds, pensions, insurers, hedge funds and other institutional investors.Total repricings since the start of October amount to $222 billion, representing 24% of all outstanding leveraged loans, according to LevFin Insights. Firms negotiated an average interest reduction of 0.59 percentage point.Even new loans, which companies are typically prohibited from refinancing for at least six months, have been caught up in the repricing wave.Dell borrowed $5 billion in September at a rate of 4% to help pay for its $60 billion purchase of EMC Corp. In January, Dell and its bankers asked investors to agree to a 0.75 percentage-point rate reduction, with the caveat that the change would only take effect in March, coinciding with the end of the six-month rate lock. As a sweetener, the company agreed to increase the loan by $500 million and issued the debt at a slight discount.“Some of our investors feel like they’ve been run over by a train,” said Jeff Cohen, co-head of Credit Suisse Group AG’s leveraged-loan department.Loans could fall back out of fashion if economic growth falters, making rate increases less likely. Investors put $63 billion into loan funds in 2013, then pulled $45 billion out over the following two years, according to Lipper.But even deals previously deemed risky have been drawing strong demand. When talent agency William Morris Endeavor Entertainment LLC and several private-equity firms used $1.8 billion of leveraged loans for their buyout of Ultimate Fighting Championship in August, the deal drew fire from bank regulators for being too aggressive. The Fed told arrangers Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG that the deal might violate guidelines about how much debt could be used for the purchase, The Wall Street Journal has reported.Despite the warnings, UFC persuaded holders of its loans in January to reprice lower by 0.75 percentage point, using the markets arms of one of its owners, KKR & Co., to step in for the banks and arrange the transaction.“Investors are sitting on a big heap of cash and there’s not a whole lot of places they can go with that money,” said Cade Thompson, director of debt capital markets at KKR.Write to Matt Wirz at matthieu.wirz@wsj.comAppeared in the February 9, 2017, print edition as 'Companies Race to Refinance Debt.'"

"PCs: Q1 Shipments a Bit Better, Says IDC; Actually, A Bit Worse, Says Gartner","Updated April 11, 2017 4:47 p.m. ET","Q1 personal computer sales are in from the two main keepers of data, research firms Gartner and IDC, and whether you believe things are getting better or getting worse depends on whom you believe.IDC said sales rose 0.6% from the first quarter of last year, the first growth for the market in five years, at 60.3 million.Gartner said sales fell 2.4%, and that shipments fell below 63 million for the first time since 2007, at 62.2 million.Both firms agree that the area of health was the corporate PC market, while the consumer market continues to deteriorate — Gartner even says some consumers have abandoned PCs forever to use phones and tablets instead.And both agree that HP Inc. (HPQ) had the best growth among the top five vendors, followed by Dell.Another factor is at work here: rising component prices. Both firms indicate that vendors built inventory of PCs as prices of chips such as DRAM rose.HP had 6.5% unit shipment growth, year over year, according to Gartner, while IDC had them rising by 13%. In IDC!'s view, HP regained the top market share in PCs for the first time in four years, while Gartner still has them trailing Lenovo Group. Fourth place Asustek was down 14% according to Gartner, while IDC actually has Apple (AAPL) in fourth place, followed by Acer.Gartner said Apple's sales rose by 4.5%, while IDC recorded a similar 4.1% growth.Gartner, describing the situation, remarks that,The PC industry experienced modest growth in the business PC market, but this was offset by declining consumer demand. Consumers continued to refrain from replacing older PCs, and some consumers have abandoned the PC market altogether. The business segment still sees the PC as an important device, and it's the main work device for businesses.IDC analyst Jay Chou stated that the PC market is at the beginning of a corporate refresh cycle that bodes well:The traditional PC market has been through a tough phase, with competition from tablets and smartphones as well as lengthening lifecycles pushing PC shipments down roughly 30% from a peak in 2011. Nevertheless, users have generally delayed PC replacements rather than giving up PCs for other devices. The commercial market is beginning a replacement cycle that should drive growth throughout the forecast. Consumer demand will remain under pressure, although growth in segments like PC Gaming as well as rising saturation of tablets and smartphones will move the consumer market toward stabilization as well.Regarding the build-up in inventories, IDC states, ""Apart from factors such as relatively improved commercial PC performance as well as a few component shortages, which continued to add to a better inventory situation, the overall PC performance for the quarter remained fairly sublime.""Gartner expects those rising component prices will keep PC prices unattractive to consumers, further hurting consumer demand."

Dell Bets $1 Billion on ‘Internet of Things’,"Oct. 10, 2017 11:00 a.m. ET","Dell Chief Executive Michael Dell at an event earlier this year. PHOTO: SIMON DAWSON/BLOOMBERG NEWSBy Rachael KingOct. 10, 2017 11:00 a.m. ET6 COMMENTSDell Technologies Inc. DVMT -0.89% is joining the crowded field of companies wagering big money on the so-called Internet of Things, as the computing giant looks for new avenues of growth amid a shift in corporate spending to the cloud.The Round Rock, Texas, company said Tuesday it will commit $1 billion over three years in research and development to create hardware and software that helps manage billions of everyday devices connected to the web.Once the largest personal-computer maker, Dell is now known as much for its corporate products like storage, servers and security software following last year’s deal to buy EMC Corp.Dell is looking for areas where it might grow as customers increasingly buy computing and storage over the Web from the likes of Amazon.com Inc.’s AMZN -5.21% Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp. while spending less on their own data-center hardware.Corporate spending on data center hardware and software from Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and others is forecast to grow less than 3% to $178 billion in 2020 from this year, according to research firm Gartner Inc. In contrast, companies are projected to increase spending on cloud infrastructure services by about double to $70 billion by 2020.As the cost of sensors in everything from thermostats to connected cars continues to plummet, Dell is betting there will be an associated boom in computing hardware and software that sits close to these devices, known as edge computing.“We think edge computing could be 100 times bigger than the internet as we know it today,” said Chief Executive Michael Dell in an interview. “That may sound crazy right now but give it a few years and I think that will be more understood.”There is some method to Mr. Dell’s madness. It is cheaper and more efficient to process information coming from sensors closer to where it originates rather than sending that data back to the cloud, said Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy. An autonomous car or a robot surgeon needs to process information in real-time and they wouldn’t tolerate delays that occur when processing information in a remote cloud.Dell is looking for areas where it might grow as customers increasingly buy computing and storage over the web. PHOTO: BOBBY YIP/REUTERSPart of Mr. Dell’s bet is that corporations will want to keep control of valuable data. An auto maker, for example, will want all that data from autonomous vehicles to be stored on their own equipment and not on someone else’s server. That data serves as a company’s crown jewels and needs to be secured, protected and managed, Mr. Dell said.As mobile carriers begin to implement fifth-generation wireless networks, it will make it easier for edge-computing devices to communicate with one each other, Mr. Dell said. For that piece, Dell is counting on subsidiary VMware’s network virtualization and security software called NSX.Dell will also rely on another subsidiary, Pivotal, as it targets corporate customers working in the Internet of Things.  General Electric Co. , for example, came to Pivotal to use its software to create its Predix platform which collects and analyzes data from industrial machines.In addition, Dell Technologies Capital, the company’s venture investing arm, has stepped up investments over the past six months in related companies including Otonomo, a connected-car data exchange marketplace, and Zingbox which makes Internet of Things device security, Dell said.Dell is somewhat late to the trend, at least in earmarking significant investment toward products. A number of tech giants including Amazon, Microsoft, Cisco Systems Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Samsung Electronics Co. have all in the past year planted their flag with new platforms or committed R&D investments.Write to Rachael King at rachael.king@wsj.com"

"Group Including Apple, Dell Moves to Buy Toshiba’s Chip Business","Updated Sept. 13, 2017 7:37 p.m. ET","Toshiba is seeking to unload the chip unit. PHOTO: KIYOSHI OTA/BLOOMBERG NEWSBy Dana Mattioli andDana CimillucaUpdated Sept. 13, 2017 7:37 p.m. ET7 COMMENTSA group including Apple Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. DVMT -0.89% surged to the front of a hotly contested race to acquire Toshiba Corp.’s TOSYY -1.80% memory-chip business, a crucial supplier to some of the world’s biggest makers of electronic gear.Toshiba said Wednesday it had signed a nonbinding agreement with the leader of the group, private-equity firm Bain Capital, and intends to reach a deal by the end of September. The bid values the business at about $19 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.The development is the latest twist in a global auction that has pitted three major bidders against each other and exposed a rift between Toshiba and a key partner, Western Digital Corp. WDC -2.47% , which is also vying for the business. At stake is control over a key building block in everything from smartphones to heavy-duty computing machines.Toshiba is racing to strike a deal in the wake of huge losses at its U.S. nuclear unit, Westinghouse Electric Co., which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year. The Tokyo company has said it needs to sell the profitable memory unit to bring its shareholder equity back into positive territory by the end of its fiscal year in March 2018. Otherwise, its shares would face delisting under Tokyo Stock Exchange rules.Besides Apple and Dell, the Bain group includes disk-drive maker Seagate Technology PLC and others, and more tech and financial players may join, according to people familiar with the matter. It also includes South Korean chip maker SK Hynix Inc., as well as Innovation Network Corp. of Japan, a fund backed by the Japanese government, and government-owned Development Bank of Japan, other people said.RELATEDTrump Blocks Lattice DealHeard on the Street: Western Digital’s PainFight at Toshiba: Some Board Members Want Deal With FoxconnToshiba Revives Talks With Foxconn Over Chip UnitTokyo Takes Lead in Toshiba Chip-Unit Sale Over China FearsToshiba’s Westinghouse Electric Files for Bankruptcy ProtectionToshiba Agrees to Provide Notice to Western Digital in Chip-Unit SaleToshiba Hasn’t Revealed That SK Hynix Could Get Stake in Its Chip BusinessToshiba Bankruptcy Filing Pushed by Some Involved in WorkoutThe scrum highlights the strategic importance of the Toshiba business, which makes NAND flash memory chips used for data storage in smartphones, computers and other electronics.Apple and Dell, which would likely supply debt financing for a Bain bid, want to ensure the Toshiba unit remains a viable supplier, according to people familiar with the matter. The tech heavyweights also want the unit to stay competitive with Samsung Electronics Co. , the leader in flash memory chips and a major rival to Apple.“This shows the dire situation that the flash memory industry is in with high prices and low availability over an extended period of time,” said Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy. “Companies need this storage to ship and sell products at a profit.”The Bain consortium’s plan would be to take the chip business private as an independent entity and bring it public again at a later date in Japan, one person said.It is far from clear that a resolution to the monthslong saga is at hand. A number of constituents with disparate interests have to agree before a deal can be completed, and a host of regulators would have to sign off. In June, Toshiba selected a group including Bain and SK Hynix as the preferred bidder before those talks stalled. Toshiba, which said Wednesday that Bain had made a new offer, added in its statement that the memorandum doesn’t preclude talks with other bidding groups.Hot ChipsToshiba has struggled to reach a deal to sell its memory-chip unit.20003000Jan. 27, 2017Expecting a multibillion-dollar loss over U.S. nuclear-reactor builder Westinghouse, Toshiba says it will sell part of its memory-chip business.Source: staff reportsAt various points in the negotiations, Toshiba has leaned toward another bidding group that includes Western Digital, a U.S. maker of hard-disk drives that is the Japanese company’s partner in the memory-chip business. But the parties haven’t been able to agree on how much influence Western Digital would have following a deal.They are now openly at odds, with Western Digital insisting it has veto rights over any sale and Toshiba saying that isn’t true. The two sides are headed for international arbitration.A spokeswoman for Western Digital, which has joined buyout giant KKR & Co. on a bid, said the company is “disappointed” by Toshiba’s move and still wants to reach a deal.Meanwhile, the Japanese government has raised objections to another bid led by Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. , because of the company’s extensive operations in China. Some government officials believe Foxconn’s China ties could result in Japanese technology leaking to that country.Given how the deal has captivated Wall Street, some of those working on it have taken to calling it privately the “RJR Nabisco of tech”—a reference to the 1980s-era leveraged buyout memorialized in the book “Barbarians at the Gate.”Toshiba’s flash-memory chips are used not just in smartphones but also in servers for cloud services, internet-connected devices and other products, demand for which is on the rise. Whether Toshiba sells the unit to one of the three bidder groups or decides not to sell after all—still a significant possibility—that robust demand is the backdrop for the spirited sales process.In Toshiba’s results for the April-June quarter, sales for the segment that includes memory chips rose 23% and operating profit for that segment was greater than the company’s total operating profit.About 30% of the NAND supply in the new iPhones Apple unveiled this week comes from Toshiba—with 30% from Western Digital, 25% from SK Hynix and the rest from Samsung and Micron Technology , Inc., according to estimates by Susquehanna International Group. A Western Digital acquisition of Toshiba could give the U.S. company increased leverage at a time when NAND prices are already rising, some customers worry.The tech industry is at peak anxiety when it comes to flash memory, said Mr. Moorhead of Moor Insights. He added that a Toshiba deal would allow Apple and Dell, two of the world’s largest purchasers of flash memory, to guarantee supply at a lower cost.Regardless of which party Toshiba chooses, antitrust clearance is likely to be a hurdle because getting approval in major markets can take more than six months. That could make it difficult for a deal to close by March 2018, although a bidder might look for ways to get money into Toshiba’s hands before closing.—Tripp Mickle and Rachael King contributed to this article.Write to Dana Mattioli at dana.mattioli@wsj.com and Dana Cimilluca at dana.cimilluca@wsj.comAppeared in the September 14, 2017, print edition as 'Apple, Dell Join Bid For Toshiba Chip Unit.'"
John Medica Helped Apple and Dell Recover From Design Fiascos,"Nov. 3, 2017 10:30 a.m. ET","John Medica was known for his sense of humor: his Apple business card listed his title as Big Shot. Above, a 2013 file photo. PHOTO: KEN BENNETT/WFUBy James R. HagertyNov. 3, 2017 10:30 a.m. ET8 COMMENTSAs computers shrank into laptops and notebooks in the late 1980s and early 1990s, some of the top makers of desktop machines stumbled in their efforts to adapt. Two of them, Apple Computer Inc. and Dell Inc., called on John Medica, a boisterous electrical engineer, to help them get back on track.In 1989, Apple introduced a portable Macintosh. Considered too expensive and bulky, it bombed. Apple assigned Mr. Medica, a 31-year-old, to head a team of engineers in a crash program to design a laptop. The result was the PowerBook, which became a huge success after its introduction in 1991.Dell poached Mr. Medica in 1993 after its laptops were panned for quality problems and deemed too slow to compete with the PowerBook and other rivals. Before accepting the offer, he received assurances that he could bring his English sheepdog, Maggie Mae, to work with him at Dell’s offices in Austin.His team at Dell came up with the Latitude line of notebook computers, introduced in 1994. They made a splash with their lithium ion batteries, a novelty then.Mr. Medica died of a heart attack Oct. 13 in Reston, Va. He was 59.He was known for his humor. His Apple business card listed his title as Big Shot.One of his top skills was building and motivating corporate teams, colleagues said. He became a mentor to many. Mark Vena, an executive who worked with Mr. Medica at Dell, recalled a meeting with the company’s founder, Michael Dell, to pitch a venture into computers for gaming. Mr. Vena kept pushing the idea even after Mr. Dell had approved it.MOREInvestor Samuel Belzberg Dies at 89 March 31, 2018Robert Haas Imported Fine French Wines, Then Made His Own in California March 30, 2018Francis Bator, Hungarian Refugee, Advised Lyndon Johnson on Economics and Europe March 30, 2018Advertising Mogul Dailey Made TV Spots for Reagan March 30, 2018After the meeting, when the two were alone, Mr. Medica wrapped an arm playfully around Mr. Vena and said, “Next time you’ve got the order, stop selling.”When they first met at Apple, Randy Battat found Mr. Medica too loud and aggressive. Later, Mr. Battat became a friend and admired Mr. Medica’s ability to steer projects successfully. “People would follow him to the end of the earth,” Mr. Battat said. “He had just a ton of energy.”John Kevin Medica was born Aug. 23, 1958, in Ridgewood, N.J., and grew up mostly in New Jersey and Connecticut. His father was an electrical engineer and aerospace executive. His mother had worked as a model.At Manhattan College in New York, he earned a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering. After working for about a year at Altus Corp., a battery company in San Jose, Calif., he enrolled in the M.B.A. program at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., where he met his future wife, Megan Salzman, who was studying speech communication and theater arts.Eager to work in the computer industry, he won a job at Apple upon graduation from Wake Forest in 1983. He worked on a variety of engineering projects there before being put in charge of the PowerBook design team.When the PowerBook notebooks came out, The Wall Street Journal’s Walter S. Mossberg described them as elegantly designed. After testing the machine on an airplane, Mr. Mossberg wrote that the screen was “easily readable either with sunlight streaming through the window or in the dark during the bad in-flight movie.”Mr. Medica was 34 when Dell brought him to Austin to sort out its notebook-computer problems. One of his early decisions there was to scrap the notebooks then being developed by Dell and start over, even though that meant taking a hit to quarterly earnings. “The product did not make sense,” he told The Wall Street Journal. The screens were hard to read, the keyboards awkward and the track balls difficult to maneuver.In August 1994, about 15 months after Mr. Medica’s arrival, Dell introduced its Latitude line of notebook computers. Though not revolutionary, that product succeeded in making Dell a major player in notebooks. The Wall Street Journal’s Mr. Mossberg praised the new Dell line for an “awesome battery life, made possible by a new lithium-ion battery technology and especially clever hardware and software that micromanages the machine’s use of power.”Working at Dell involved frequent trips to Asia to coordinate with suppliers, including Compal Electronics Inc. of Taiwan. Mr. Medica, who typically wore a- New York Yankees cap while traveling, was away from home so much that his wife, Megan, meeting one of his return flights to Austin, held up a sign reading “Wife” and pointing to her.Dell later sent him to head a subsidiary in Japan. After 14 years with Dell, he resigned in 2007 at age 49, partly because he felt exhausted. That allowed him to spend more time sailing a 100-foot Nautor’s Swan boat dubbed the Red Sky.After taking about a year off, he joined Compal as a vice chairman and strategic adviser to the Taiwanese electronics company. He also was a director of companies including Electro Scientific Industries Inc. and served on the board of trustees at Wake Forest University.His survivors include his wife of 32 years, Megan, and a brother, James B.

Why Remote Work Can’t Be Stopped,"June 4, 2017 8:00 a.m. ET","Julia Amosova works from her New York City apartment or from co-working spaces as a ‘happiness engineer’ in tech support at Automattic, maker of Wordpress and other products. ‘I love the freedom of being anywhere in the world and still being able to work,’ Ms. Amosova said. PHOTO: STEVE REMICH FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNALBy Christopher MimsJune 4, 2017 8:00 a.m. ET130 COMMENTSWhen Dell recently surveyed its 110,000 employees about their work habits, it discovered something surprising: While only 17% of Dell’s employees were formally authorized to work wherever they prefer, 58% were already working remotely at least one day a week. That’s good news, says Steve Price, chief human resources officer at Dell. In 2013, the company had said it wanted half its employees to work remotely for at least part of their week… by 2020.In contrast, International Business Machines IBM -2.19% recently gave thousands of its home-based employees a choice: Start working at one of IBM’s regional offices or take a hike. IBM once boasted that 40% of its employees work outside traditional offices, it has its own in-house tools to facilitate remote work, and it regularly promotes telework to its clients. Other companies that have reversed course on remote work include Yahoo, Bank of America and Aetna.Despite these moves by big companies, data indicates that the remote-work trend in the U.S. labor force is inexorable, aided by ever-better tools for getting work done anywhere. Surveys done by Gallup indicate that in 2016, the proportion of Americans who did some or all of their work from home was 43%, up from 39% in 2012. Over the same period, the proportion who only work remotely went to 20% from 15%. Amazon.com , American Express , UnitedHealth Group , and Salesforce.com allow employees to work remotely at least some of the time.IBM has said it hasn’t found remote work saves money. It also said the shift away from remote work isn’t aimed at cutting costs—though inevitably some employees leave as a result. Other companies, though, cite saving on rent among a variety of reasons for letting employees work remotely. They say it also improves employee satisfaction, helping retention and recruiting.Ginni Rometty, chief executive of International Business Machines, spoke during a television interview on the sidelines of the IBM InterConnect 2017 conference in Las Vegas on March 21. PHOTO: DAVID BECKER/BLOOMBERG NEWSThe larger truth is that nearly every company that employs knowledge workers is still learning which jobs can best be done remotely, as the tools to accomplish remote work become increasingly powerful.Making the transition in a big company isn’t easy, Dell’s Mr. Price says. What is absolutely essential is getting everyone the right tools. This can be expensive and time consuming, even for companies whose primary purpose is building those tools.To understand the issues, it’s helpful to look at a company that has always been almost entirely remote. Automattic, maker of WordPress, the content-management system that powers 28% of all websites, has 558 employees spread across more than 50 countries, up from 302 in December 2014.Despite its growth, the company is getting rid of its custom-designed, light-filled, 14,250-square-foot office in a hip San Francisco neighborhood. On an average day, maybe five workers will show up, dwarfed by the cavernous space and nearly outnumbered by the ping-pong and foosball tables that mostly sit idle.With teams that may be spread across a dozen time zones, Automattic relies on Slack for synchronous communication, Zoom for weekly video conferences and its own internal system of threaded conversations for documenting everyone’s work and for major decisions.When everyone is forced to communicate through these tools, no one is left out, says Mark Armstrong, whose site, Longreads, was acquired by Automattic in 2014. “Everyone knows that feeling where you’re the one on the conference call and everyone else is in the room together,” he says.A distributed workforce can have other benefits, says Julia Amosova, a “happiness engineer” at Automattic. The online communication required allows for radical transparency, since anyone in the company can search across all internal communications. “Most of the meetings were held behind closed doors at other places I worked at,” she says. “I didn’t have the same feeling of unity and inclusion.”In a distributed workforce, where closed-door meetings aren’t possible, the ubiquity of online communication leads to radical transparency in decision-making. PHOTO: STEVE REMICH FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNALUnless you’re a pure software company like Automattic, being 100% remote probably isn’t an option. Dell isn’t planning to get any more of its employees working remotely, Mr. Price says. “Engineering, leadership, R&D, sales and customer support—those are roles that don’t lend themselves very well to remote work. Not everybody gets to do it.” Roles where it does work include HR, legal, marketing, analytics, data science and other support functions, he adds.For workers in an office, collaboration occurs naturally, says Jason Owen-Smith, a professor of sociology at the University of Michigan who has studied collaboration and innovation at academic research institutions. His research indicates that for every 100 feet of overlap between the typical daily walking paths of people in a building, there’s a 17% increase in the likelihood two researchers who have not previously worked together will collaborate on a new project—and a 20% increase in the likelihood they will get their project funded.In one building Dr. Owen-Smith and his team studied, the men’s and women’s restrooms were at opposite ends of the facility: Same-gender collaborations went up and mixed-gender collaborations were suppressed. Famously, at Pixar, Steve Jobs put the bathrooms in the center of the building, to force people to cross paths multiple times a day.For remote workers, the communications tools they use daily are the equivalent of these common spaces. The canonical example, owing to its explosive growth and creeping ubiquity, is the group-chat service Slack. It’s designed to make it easy for employees to communicate in ways that aren’t so different from the way they would around a water cooler or a conference table. Slack’s playful features, like on-demand animated GIFs, make it good for collegial interaction, while its library of chatbots and integrations with other enterprise software make it useful as a hub for communicating about and controlling many aspects of a business.What matters even more than the tools is the process that underlies them, says Jason Fried, co-founder and chief executive of Basecamp, which makes digital project-management and collaboration tools, and the author of “Remote,” a book about working remotely. Everyone on a team, remote or not, has to be willing to participate in that process, or else someone will miss out on key information and decisions.“You have to be committed to this digital transformation, and be ready to invest to do this well,” says Dell’s Mr. Price. “Otherwise you have a lot of morale issues, engagement issues and a bad cultural response.”"

Children and parents may turn imagined events into memories, misremember details or interpret shared events differently. And grown children often recall incidents parents have forgotten or blocked out.Mary Dell Harrington, standing second from left with her husband Mel Berning, says her family has reaped benefits from talking about childhood memories with her son Walker, left, shown at age 22 in this 2013 photo, and daughter Annie, right, shown at age 17. PHOTO: TIM BROWN PHOTOGRAPHYTaking time to compare memories and hash out the differences can help family members make peace with lingering issues that they never thought they could resolve.Mary Dell Harrington has no recollection of walking down the driveway of her Larchmont, N.Y., home to meet her daughter’s school bus one afternoon 12 years ago. Ms. Harrington had just gotten word that her beloved 80-year-old father had suffered a stroke in a distant state, and she was upset.Quit Feeling Guilty About Missing Your Child’s PerformanceParents often agonize when they have to miss a child’s big game or stage performance, but their absence can be a good thing when handled skillfully.CLICK TO READ STORYMORE ON PARENTINGHer 21-year-old daughter, Annie Berning, was 9 at the time. She recalls the moment clearly.“I can see the outfit she was wearing,” she says. It was a longish blue skirt and sunglasses that hid her mother’s tears. Before Ms. Harrington could tell Annie the news, Annie asked her to drive her to the mall. When she learned a moment later that her grandfather had fallen ill, Ms. Berning felt sad and overwhelmed, she says. As the family cared for him and later prepared to attend his funeral, she began feeling guilty about asking for a trivial favor in the midst of a family crisis.Ms. Harrington was dismayed to learn her daughter still harbored some guilt when the topic came up recently. She reassured her that asking to go shopping hadn’t been inappropriate or unkind. Ms. Berning says she found the conversation comforting.“Talking about these stories gives you a chance to clear up tiny misconceptions, or tell your children it’s OK,” says Ms. Harrington, a writer and co-founder of Grown and Flown, a blog for parents of 15- to 25-year-olds.Recalling a memory isn’t like replaying a mental video. More often, memories are reconstructions of facts, inferences and imagined details that people patch together after the fact, helping them build a sense of identity. Parents and children alike may forget difficult moments they don’t want to recall.Children and teens are most likely to remember events that are both emotional and relevant to the developmental stage they’re in at the time, a 2016 study shows.Playing sports was important to Annie’s brother Walker Berning as a teenager. He was a football, baseball and hockey player and also ran track. His most vivid memories from that time are of injuries that sidelined him, including a clipped Achilles tendon in a schoolyard accident that kept him off the baseball diamond for a while. Now 26, Mr. Berning is a Washington, D.C., financial analyst.Annie Berning, shown at 8 years of age in this 2003 photo, and her brother Walker, who was 13 at the time, have vivid memories of emotional events that took place during this stage of their lives. PHOTO: PHYLLIS TARLOWTwins and siblings who are close in age sometimes claim memories that actually happened to the other sibling, such as winning a swim competition, a 2001 study says.Children perceive the passage of time differently than adults, says Robyn Fivush, a psychology professor at Emory University. Adults can track time on a phone or calendar, but a few days can feel like weeks to a child, causing him to remember events as lasting longer than they actually did.That generation gap has become a running joke in the Wingens family. Helene Wingens’s two older sons, Andrew, 25, and Jonathan, 20, vividly recall a baby nurse staying with the family for several weeks after their younger brother David was born 16 years ago. Every time it comes up, Ms. Wingens wonders what they’re talking about. Ms. Wingens, a Livingston, N.J., writer, insists the nurse stayed only for a weekend.Andrew and Jonathan remember the nurse watching “CatDog” cartoons on the family TV, and insist they wouldn’t have such vivid memories after only a weekend. Whatever the case, the baby-nurse dispute has become a fixture in family lore. “I don’t think we’ll ever settle it,” Jonathan says.Setting the record straight can be worth the effort. Children’s memories sometimes reflect harmful distortions, such as a child blaming himself for his parents’ divorce, says Kate McLean, author of “The Co-Authored Self,” a book on how individuals build a sense of identity through shared stories. It’s best in such cases to explain the real reasons in an age-appropriate way, to relieve him of that burden.In other cases, it’s better for children to be allowed to stick to their own version of events. Families sometimes tell and retell stories that cast a child in the same role over and over, as a screw-up or a maverick, without regard for the fact that she has changed and moved on, Dr. McLean says. This can feel confining to teens or young adults.Parents might dwell on stories about how sensitive a teen was as a child and how she cried a lot, while the teen may be trying to cobble together a more mature self-image, insisting, “No, I’m not sensitive at all. I’m strong!” says Dr. McLean, a psychology professor at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Wash.As she presses family members to revise their view, Dr. McLean says, the teen learns to stand up for herself.WORK & FAMILY MAILBOXQ: Enjoyed your recent column on visual distractions at the office. I’ve been wearing noise-cancelling headphones to block out my co-workers’ loud voices, but they’re not working. Any advice?—D.Z.A: Noise-cancelling headphones block continuous sounds such as an airplane engine, but don’t work well in screening out co-workers’ conversations. Many people find listening to background-noise apps with headphones or earbuds works better. These apps include variations on white noise, which is consistent in intensity across all frequencies and has a tinny sound. Pink noise plays lower frequencies at greater intensity, like the low rumble of rain or wind through trees. Brown noise is the deepest of the three and resembles the roar of a waterfall.Among the best apps is myNoise.net, with dozens of tracks from ocean waves to the running water and birdsong of a Japanese garden. Noisli allows users to create their own blend of sounds from a menu ranging from coffee-shop chatter to a meadow at night. Another is Coffitivity, offering tracks that evoke the ambience of various kinds of cafes. Also worth considering is Naturespace, with a big catalog of high-quality nature tracks.MORE WORK & FAMILYNew Strategies Help Women Build Career Confidence March 19, 2018Quit Feeling Guilty About Missing Your Child’s Performance March 13, 2018How to Gain Power at Work When You Have None March 6, 2018An Escape to the Dentist?

PHOTO: YURIKO NAKAO/REUTERSBy Takashi Mochizuki,Peter Landers andDana CimillucaUpdated Sept. 20, 2017 11:40 a.m. ET4 COMMENTSTOKYO— Toshiba Corp.’s TOSYY -1.80% board on Wednesday voted to sell its memory-chip business to a group that includes Apple Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. for ¥2 trillion ($18 billion), moving the deal closer to final agreement despite objections from a Toshiba business partner.The troubled Japanese industrial conglomerate said it hoped to conclude a final contract soon with the bidder group, which is led by U.S. private-equity firm Bain Capital. Toshiba outlined a plan to keep a role in the chip unit even after the sale, reflecting its desire to stay involved in a business that has been growing quickly thanks to demand for the chips in smartphones, computer servers and other electronics.Toshiba said it chose the Bain group over two rival groups, one that includes Western Digital Corp. and the other represented by Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group. The decision comes a week after Toshiba and the Bain group signed a nonbinding document saying they intended to reach a deal by Sept. 30.At least two hurdles remain to a deal: antitrust review by authorities around the globe, and objections from Western Digital, Toshiba’s partner in the chip business. Western Digital says it has the right to veto any sale, while Toshiba says no such right exists. The two parties are headed for international arbitration.Toshiba said that under its interpretation, it could carry through with the sale of the chip unit even if Western Digital wins a favorable ruling in arbitration. Western Digital said it was “disappointed” by Toshiba’s decision and confident that it would prevail in arbitration.While Toshiba’s statement Wednesday didn’t mention Apple and Dell, Bain has said its consortium includes those two companies as well as Kingston Technology Corp. and Seagate Technology PLC. Apple plans to offer a loan guarantee of some $3 billion to support the Bain group, a person familiar with the matter said. The person cautioned that final terms have yet to be set.Meanwhile, Seagate, which helped assemble the Bain consortium, will contribute as much as $1.25 billion in the form of nonconvertible preferred securities, the person said. The disk-drive maker is expected to sign a long-term supply agreement with an independent Toshiba chip business.By joining the deal, big customers for Toshiba’s chips such as Apple may find it easier to secure supply in a market with high demand. They would also prop up a rival to the memory-chip leader, Samsung Electronics Co. , which competes with Apple in smartphones.Hot ChipsToshiba has struggled to reach a deal to sell its memory-chip unit.20003000Jan. 27, 2017Expecting a multibillion-dollar loss over U.S. nuclear-reactor builder Westinghouse, Toshiba says it will sell part of its memory-chip business.Source: staff reportsUnder the procedure outlined by Toshiba on Wednesday, it would sell the chip unit for about $18 billion to a special purpose company set up by Bain. Once the deal closes, Toshiba would invest ¥350.5 billion ($3.2 billion) in that company. A Toshiba spokesman said if those steps happened as planned, Toshiba would hold a stake of between 20% and 50% in the chip unit.The sale process, which began in January, has gone through many twists and turns as a divided Toshiba board considered the offers, bidders revised their terms and the Japanese government weighed in. Japanese officials expressed caution about the bid by Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. 2317 -1.02% , because of its extensive operations in China.Toshiba needs the money because of huge losses from its U.S. nuclear subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric Co., which filed for bankruptcy protection in March. As of June 30, Toshiba’s liabilities exceeded assets by about $4.5 billion.If the deal with the Bain group goes through, Toshiba said it expected to earn after-tax profit of nearly $7 billion, which it said would put its balance sheet back in the black by next March 31. That would clear the way for its shares to remain listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.But the schedule is tight, even if Toshiba reaches a definitive agreement soon with the Bain group. Toshiba’s chip business has the second-largest market share by revenue after Samsung, according to research firm IHS Markit , and a sale of such a big business is normally reviewed intensively by antitrust authorities of various nations. The process often takes more than six months.Toshiba said the Bain group envisioned transferring a limited number shares in the chip unit to a “foreign company,” which it didn’t name. A person familiar with the matter said the foreign company was South Korean chip maker SK Hynix Inc. The extent of SK Hynix’s future involvement in the Toshiba chip unit is likely to be scrutinized by antitrust authorities.The Bain group was initially led by the Innovation Network Corp. of Japan, a fund backed by the Japanese government, and included the government-owned Development Bank of Japan, but they later scaled back their involvement. Toshiba said Wednesday the two government-affiliated entities could eventually take a stake in the chip unit and, ahead of that, would be granted certain rights to influence key decisions at the unit.Write to Takashi Mochizuki at takashi.mochizuki@wsj.com, Peter Landers at peter.landers@wsj.com and Dana Cimilluca at dana.cimilluca@wsj.comAppeared in the September 21, 2017, print edition as 'Bain Prevails in Toshiba Contest.'"
"Cannes 2017: Facing Harsh Ad Industry Realities, One Glass of Rosé At a Time","June 23, 2017 12:01 p.m. ET","Ad executives chewed over big industry problems at the Cannes Lions International Festival Of Creativity. PHOTO: BLOOMBERG NEWSBy Suzanne VranicaJune 23, 2017 12:01 p.m. ET1 COMMENTSCANNES, France -- Attendees at this year’s Cannes advertising festival enjoyed the usual yacht rides, celebrity sightings and rosé-fueled parties, but the topics of conversation were often of the gloomier variety.From Madison Avenue’s inadequate diversity and shortage of transparency in the digital ad business, to the mighty power of the Google- Facebook “duopoly,” the thousands of media and tech executives who descended on the French Riviera had some harsh realities to confront.Top of mind for many was the shocking speed at which brands’ reputations can be put at risk when a controversial ad or ad-placement goes viral on social media.“These issues that arise are not brand problems, they are business problems,” said Liz Matthews, senior vice president of brand and creative at Dell.Fake news and ad blocking were other recurring themes throughout the week-long conference.Advertisers Try to Avoid the Web’s Dark SideWith automated digital advertising, marketers get scale, low prices and precise targeting. But it also comes with the risk of a brand winding up in the wrong place.CLICK TO READ ARTICLETHE AD MAZENew Yorker Editor David Remnick bashed President Donald Trump and singled out social media platforms for helping to spread fake news. Meanwhile, Keith Weed, Unilever ’s chief marketing officer, told Wall Street Journal panel attendees that the industry needs a digital supply chain that is less “murky.”Speaking on a panel hosted by the International Advertising Association, Procter & Gamble Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard —who earlier this year threw down the gauntlet, demanding agencies and tech companies clean up the online ad business—said the industry is about 40% to 50% there in terms of fixing the digital supply chain. He is hopeful that by the end of the year it will be accomplished.Once again, the festival highlighted the fact that the ad business is under pressure to overhaul its workforce and attract more women and minorities.Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson talked up how brands can help raise social consciousness by highlighting different types of people and lifestyles. He also called on companies, to diversify their boards.The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media released some alarming statistics during the festival that showed men get about four times as much screen time in ads as women and one-in-ten female characters are shown in sexually revealing clothing. The organization looked at 2,000 ads submitted to Cannes that were created in the last 10 years.“We need to talk less, do more and move faster,” to solve this diversity problem, said Antonio Lucio, chief marketing officer of HP Inc. “It’s becoming embarrassing.”The heavy topics didn’t slow down the non-stop schmoozing that the conference is known for. Countless media owners, ad tech companies and platforms tried to dazzle marketers and agencies—with the help of fine food and musical acts such as the Weeknd, Ed Sheeran, Phoenix and Solange Knowles—in the hopes of convincing them to open their wallets. That’s a far tougher task nowadays, as Facebook and Google snap up much of the money in the digital marketplace.The growing dominance of the two tech behemoths was a major topic at cocktail parties, as rivals struggle to find a way to grab their share of spending. Emarketer estimates that the tech titans earned 77 cents of each new dollar spent on digital advertising in the U.S. last year.Ad giants such as WPP, Publicis Groupe SA and Omnicom Group Inc. experienced slower growth in the U.S., during the first quarter, with some blaming global uncertainty and lackluster economic growth.Those business conditions had an impact on the foot traffic on the Promenade de la Croisette, as ad holding companies trimmed back the contingents they sent. With the festival markedly less crowded this year, attendees celebrated the fact that it was easier to get a table at the Carlton Terrace.Publicis made a splash (or belly flop) with the announcement that it’s planning to take a year off from the festival and reallocate resources to a new internal technology platform called Marcel.The announcement triggered a backlash from employees and competitors who see value in the awards.Write to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com"

Today’s Top Supply Chain and Logistics News From WSJ,"Dec. 13, 2017 6:11 a.m. ET","By Paul PageDec. 13, 2017 6:11 a.m. ET0 COMMENTSSign up: With one click, get this newsletter delivered to your inbox.There’s hardly any slack in the slack season at U.S. ports heading toward the end of the year. Southern California’s big seaports are reporting an unusually strong late-season surge in imports, WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes, a sign that retailers boosted by strong consumer sales are restocking inventories at a rapid pace to tap into the resurgent sales demand. Experts say the late surge is being driven by accelerating e-commerce growth, which is driving a big increase in airfreight and ocean shipments across the Pacific. Trade data group Panjiva Inc. says U.S. seaports overall saw a 5.6% year-over-year gain in volume last month. But the growth was far stronger at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which together were up 10.6% from last year. More important, their imports jumped 8.4% from October to November to levels closer to the peak season. The containers are pushing more goods to road and rail distribution networks, and to consumers that the retailers hope are still in a buying mood.The “Amazon Effect” is hitting central banks. The growing use of the Web-driven comparison shopping that consumers are doing on their smartphones is starting to have a big impact on the basic measures of the economy, the WSJ’s Harriett Torry and Laura Stevens write, adding new complications to the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates. The problem is that consumer knowledge is keeping a lid on prices that retailers can charge, and that’s become a growing factor holding down inflation in advanced economies. While retailers wrestle with prices and profit margins, policy makers are still trying to figure out how the consumer pricing fits into the range of measures they look at in considering the direction of the broader economy. Central bankers want inflation to rise to an annual rate of around 2%, considered a healthy level. But recent research suggests online price competition may be subtracting as much as a tenth of a percentage point from core inflation.A surge in global oil prices is being built on supply as much as demand. A wave of oil-supply disruptions and OPEC’s production cuts has raised hopes among investors and producers that the beleaguered industry is seeing the end of the crude glut. Oil inventories in the industrialized world have fallen to their lowest levels in two years, the WSJ’s Georgi Kantchev and Benoit Faucon report, helping push the price for international benchmark Brent crude this week to its highest level in 30 months. After a three-year roller coaster, producers now are preparing for a stable price around $60 a barrel or higher. The recent surge has sent U.S. prices for diesel close to $3 a gallon, up some 50% in the past 21 months. The most recent jolt to the market came in Great Britain, where a major pipeline sprung a leak and cut off supply for a time, sending prices upward and signaling that supplies are too tight to withstand such an interruption.SUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIESThe Port of Los Angeles. PHOTO: TIM RUE FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNALAn explosion in Austria highlights the thin band of infrastructure used for natural gas distribution. The blast at Austria’s largest import hub left one person dead and reverberated across Europe, the WSJ’s Zeke Turner reports, triggering a state of emergency in Italy and the highest gas prices in 3 years in the U.K. Almost a third of Italy’s supply flows through the hub, and the explosion compounded existing gas-supply concerns in the U.K., coming just a day after a major supplier said it was shutting down an important section of a Scottish pipeline. Gas at times has been a political pawn in Europe but countries have sought to keep prices and supply stable even as domestic gas production has dropped in the last decades. Many countries have mandatory rules that force gas suppliers to fill up gas stores before the cold winter months. The countries now are looking at how much they have in storage, and whether other pipeline flows can be redirected.QUOTABLE‘People are stocking up like crazy to meet the demand from e-commerce.’—Bjorn Vang Jensen, vice president of global logistics for appliance-maker Electrolux AB.Number of the Day$2.07Average spot rate for truckload transport in the U.S. in November, the highest in nearly three years, according to DAT Solutions LLC.IN OTHER NEWSThe rate of unemployment across the world’s developed economies returned to its precrisis level in October.

"VMware: It’s All About Dell, Says Hilliard Lyons, Cutting To Hold","March 2, 2018 4:33 p.m. ET","As mentioned earlier, most analysts looking at yesterday’s better than expected fiscal Q4 report from virtualization pioneer  VMware (VMW) are concluding that financials don’t matter as much as Michael Dell’s rumored interest in taking the company private via a reverse merger.That has prompted one downgrade of the stock today, from Hilliard Lyons analyst Stephen Turner.Turner, cutting his rating to Neutral from “Long Term Buy,” makes note of several nice things in the report, including how its recent partnership with Amazon (AMZN) is spurring its software license sales:Non-GAAP revenue totaled $2.31 billion, increasing 14% y/y, the fastest growth rate since Q4’14. More importantly, License revenues increased 20%, to $1.07 billion, its fastest rate since Q4’11. License growth has been spurred by its partnership with public cloud providers.And Turner raises his price target to $150 from $145, “however, we downgrade shares to Neutral from Long term Buy as the potential of a reverse merger with Dell hangs over shares of VMW.""""We believe recent tax reform changes could be playing a role in Dell’s sooner than expected potential deal with VMware, which is several years ahead of our prior view.""A Dell deal would be bad for VMware holders, he believes:Unfortunately, we believe VMware shareholders may not receive fair value for the 20% of VMware Dell does not own, which is publicly traded under the VMW ticker. VMware shareholders have little to no recourse for any action taken by parent company Dell. As such, we downgrade shares of VMW to Neutral following Dell’s potential attempt to do a reverse merger with VMware which we view as dilutive to VMW shareholders. We believe potential action by Dell could be a near term negative catalyst and as such we reduce our suitability rating to a 4.VMware stock today closed down $7.32, or 6%, at $116.34, while shares of the tracking stock for Dell’s majority interest in VMware, Dell Technologies (DVMT), closed up $1.71, or 2.3%, at $73.66."

PHOTO: JASON GROW FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNALBy Katherine ClarkeMarch 22, 2018 8:00 a.m. ET47 COMMENTSKnown for his lavish spreads in his hometown of Austin, Texas, and on the Big Island of Hawaii, tech mogul Michael Dell has expanded east, buying two super-deluxe high-rise homes in Boston and in New York City in recent years.In 2014, Mr. Dell, 53, spent $100.47 million on a penthouse on New York’s Billionaire’s Row, setting a record for the city’s priciest home purchase, people familiar with the transaction said. Last year, he snapped up a penthouse seeking $40 million at the Four Seasons Private Residences One Dalton Street in Boston.Michael Dell, founder of Dell Technologies PHOTO: GETTY IMAGESThe purchases significantly add to Mr. Dell’s real-estate holdings, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. Before these buys he owned two homes around his hometown of Austin, Texas, and a third retreat on the Big Island of Hawaii’s Kohala coast.A college dropout, Mr. Dell earned his fortune by starting Dell Technologies , which makes and sells personal computers and other technology products. Most of that fortune lies in his private-investment firm MSD Capital, which was set up to manage his family’s fortune. MSD Capital’s real-estate holdings are purely for investment purposes, a person familiar with his investment strategies said, such as a home in Los Cabos, Mexico, which is on the market for $18.5 million.Here is a snapshot of Mr. Dell’s personal properties.A aerial view of Mr. Dell’s approximately 33,000-square-foot compound in Austin, Texas. PHOTO: PICTOMETRYAustinIn Austin, Mr. Dell built an approximately 33,000-square-foot compound for his family. He and his wife, Susan, completed the property in 1996, according to a person familiar with the project, the same year his company launched its website Dell.com.Mr. Dell tapped New York City firm Gwathmey Siegel & Associates Architects —whose founder Charles Gwathmey was best known for designing homes for the likes of Steven Spielberg and David Geffen. Juan Miro, an architect from the firm, was dispatched to Texas to oversee its completion, the person said. Gwathmey Siegel’s style is famously modernist and geometrically complicated, and Mr. Dell’s granite and stainless-steel house is no exception. It has eight bedrooms and 16 bathrooms, a home gym and an indoor lap pool. A stairwell includes polished wood panels and a bowed steel banister, which frames a sculpture by artist Joel Shapiro.MORE FROM MANSIONAmtrak Ends Chartered and Specialty Train Trips on U.S. Railways March 29, 2018How Much Is That Luxury Home? It’s a Secret March 29, 2018Living in ‘the Valley’ Is, Like, Cool Now March 29, 2018Property records show that Mr. and Mrs. Dell own several vacant lots adjacent to their property, bringing the total compound to about 119 acres. The adjacent lots all have a conservation easement, meaning they are permanently restricted from being developed. The property is a 20-mile drive from Round Rock, Texas, where Dell Technologies is based.In 1997, Mr. Dell challenged his $600,000 property-tax bill after county assessors valued the home at $22.5 million, according to legal filings. At the time, Mr. Dell’s attorney said his client had spent about $30 million on improvements to the property. The resolution wasn’t disclosed.In the hills about 12 miles away, Mr. Dell also owns a quirky geometric house known as 6D Ranch. Named after the six members of the family, it is where their Arabian horses are kept, according to a person familiar with the property.The three penthouses at the Four Seasons Private Residences One Dalton Street were most recently on the market for about $40 million. PHOTO: JASON GROW FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNALBostonIn September 2016, Dell Technologies completed an approximately $67 billion deal to acquire EMC, a company dealing in data storage and data protection, marking what was then the largest technology merger in U.S. history. EMC would keep its operations in Hopkinton, Mass., where it is located, according to a statement from the company at the time.In 2017, Mr. Dell inked a contract for a penthouse at the Four Seasons Private Residences One Dalton Street, according to people familiar with the transaction.The tower will be Boston’s tallest residential building when it is completed next year. The unit is one of three penthouses and was most recently on the market for about $40 million. The building’s three penthouses have soaring ceilings and double-height terraces with outdoor fireplaces, according to the project’s website.Mr. Dell quietly purchased a $100.47 million penthouse at New York’s One57 tower in 2014. PHOTO: AFP/GETTY IMAGESNew YorkMr. Dell’s $100.47 million purchase at One57, the more than 1,000-foot condo tower on Manhattan’s West 57th street, set the record for the most expensive home ever sold in New York City. His aerie totals 10,923 square feet, with six bedrooms and six bathrooms, according to an offering plan for the project. The building’s glassy units have sprawling views of Central Park.Luxury agents say building’s reputation as the pinnacle of prestige has faded. “When he bought it, it was the symbol of success for supertalls,” said New York appraiser Jonathan Miller. “Since then, it’s been mired in a lot of negative stories about unsold units and new competition from other projects.” A buyer who paid $32 million for an apartment at One57 in 2014 sold it for $23.5 million in 2016, public records show.A bird’s eye view of Mr. Dell’s Hawaii estate, which is known as the Raptor Residence.

In partnership with former Walmart chairman Rob Walton, it also owns the entirety of Hualalai, a master-planned residential community on the Big Island surrounding the highly rated Four Seasons there.Mr. Dell’s personal home is located in the nearby, exclusive residential community of Kukio. Unlike other Hawaiian coastal communities, Kukio is accessible only to homeowners and their guests. Visitors need permission of a homeowner to enter. A clubhouse in the community fronts Hawaiian fish ponds and an archaeological reserve, with views of the island of Maui, according to the community’s website.Mr. Dell’s home appears to be the largest in the community at 18,500 square feet and with seven bedrooms, according to plans. People call the property Raptor Residence, as Mr. Dell purchased it in under a limited-liability company of that name."
Dell’s VMware Slips in Late Trading Despite FYQ4 Beat,"March 1, 2018 6:07 p.m. ET","Shares of virtualization pioneer VMware (VMW) are down 66 cents in late trading, or half a percent, at $123, after the company this afternoon reported fiscal Q4 revenue and earnings that topped analysts’ expectations, and affirmed a previously offered outlook for 2019.In a first pass at the report, Mizuho’s Abhey Lamba notes the figure for license revenue came in higher than expected, at $1.068 billion versus consensus for $1.028 billion. “Billings” was also “modestly"" higher.The report follows a drop in VMware stock during the regular session of 6%, prompted by a CNBC report that said Michael Dell, controlling shareholder of privately held Dell, is considering a reverse merger between Dell and VMware, of which it already owns the majority of shares outstanding, as my colleague Andrew Bary related. As Andrew notes, the report was actually good for the tracking stock for Dell's investment in VMware, DVMT, which closed up 1.5% today.VMware’s revenue in the three months ended in January rose almost 14%, year over year, to $2.31 billion, yielding EPS of $1.68, excluding some costs. That was above the average estimate for $2.26 billion and $1.63 per share.CEO Pat Gelsinger called it a “strong” quarter, and noted the company is entering its 20th year in business this year.CFO Zane Rowe noted the company had achieved $3.2 billion in operating cash flow in the year just ended “while continuing to invest in products and services to drive future growth."""

"The Best Windows Laptop $1,000(ish) Can Buy","March 27, 2018 10:55 a.m. ET","Finding the Perfect $1,000 Windows LaptopFor Windows laptops, the pricing sweet spot is $1,000. WSJ's David Pierce walks you through the best options from Microsoft, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Acer, and lands on an overall great pick. Photo/Video: Emily Prapuolenis/The Wall Street JournalBy David PierceMarch 27, 2018 10:55 a.m. ET177 COMMENTSYou still need a laptop. You can try to work from your phone—best of luck—and technically an iPad does a lot of laptop-y things. But when there’s work to be done, nothing else beats that combination of keyboard, trackpad, larger screen and desktop apps.Buying a laptop is a little harder than buying a phone. Companies sell so many models and so many options, it feels like you need a Ph.D. to tell them apart. How is anyone supposed to make sense of a choice like Intel Core i5-8600K vs. Intel Core i7-8550U? If you get it wrong, though, you’re stuck: Intel says most people upgrade only every five or six years.Let’s simplify things by looking at the $1,000 mark. Spend less and you tend to sacrifice important specs or features. Spend more and you’re buying diminishing returns: slightly thinner, minimally faster. Unless you want to pay for gaming power or an Apple logo, a grand buys all the Windows laptop you need.Yes, Windows. Chromebooks have their uses, but you should get something that can run all your apps, connect to all your accessories and work the way you do. Apple’s $1,299 MacBook is a luxury product by contrast, but thanks to its weak keyboard and underpowered processor, it’s not even necessarily a great one. We expect a full MacBook overhaul this year which could change the equation, but for now, at this price, you want Windows.After lots of research and testing, I found five laptops you should consider. You can find each one for between $900 and $1,100, though remember: Windows laptops can have volatile pricing, so always look out for sales. All have strengths and weaknesses—there’s no perfect laptop at any price—but I’ve highlighted a standout feature for each of my picks. I’ve also named an overall winner, in case you want to skip to the end. (OK, fine: It’s HP Inc.’s HPQ -3.56% Spectre x360.)Dell| XPS 13$999BATTERYLOOKSPOWERVERSATILITYPROSCONSRidiculous webcam placement; chintzy keyboardBig screen in a small body; attractive designSources: the company (photo); WSJ analysis of the laptopThe Pretty OneIn most ways, Dell’s XPS 13 is every bit as good as any of its competitors. In one way it’s the best: By nearly eliminating the bezel around the display, Dell squeezed the XPS 13 into a smaller body than all of its competitors. Without those big borders, the screen just looks better. The XPS 13 scored the second-best time in my battery tests, it has all the right chips and features, and it looks like it cost good money.But… that tiny bezel forced Dell to move the webcam down below the screen, which is a terrible place. Rather than framing my face, the camera stares up my nose. (Dell says most users don’t mind the placement.)The bigger problem is that the XPS 13 you want costs $1,200. The standard model comes with a paltry four gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage—neither of which will suffice.Microsoft| Surface Pro$958BATTERYLOOKSPOWERVERSATILITYPROSCONSHard to use on your lap; low-end processorLight, thin and versatile; most tablet-like of the bunchSources: the company (photo); WSJ analysis of the laptopThe Portable OneLike the best camera, the best laptop is the one you have with you. No Windows computer combines portability and functionality quite like Microsoft Corp.’s Surface Pro, the tablet/laptop hybrid that inspired so many competitors. It’s the size and shape of an iPad, with the full power of Windows.Unfortunately, all that versatility compromises the Surface Pro’s utility, and I don’t just mean the smaller screen. And, because the crucial keyboard accessory sells separately for $160, it’s deceptively expensive. (I’ve included it in my pricing, because you need it.) The only way to hit the $1,000 target and still get the whole kit is to buy the cheapest model, which uses a vastly underpowered processor. You might opt for Microsoft’s other offering in this range, the Surface Laptop but, as comfortable as it is to use, it doesn’t measure up to my other picks.| Swift 3Acer$999BATTERYLOOKSPOWERVERSATILITYPROSCONSBig and heavy; more desktop than laptopLots of ports; big screen and roomy keyboardSources: the company (photo); WSJ analysis of the laptopThe Powerful OneMany laptops in this price range offer enough processing oomph for web browsing, Netflixing and Exceling, but not gamer-grade horsepower. Acer Inc.’s Swift 3 does a little better. Its Core i7 processor, more powerful than you’ll often find at this price, makes the machine more suitable for Photoshop users or inveterate tab-hoarders. Just don’t expect it to run “Fortnite.”Acer also added a large selection of ports to the Swift 3 and a relatively large 14-inch display. But all that extra stuff makes it larger and heavier than my other picks. It works as a stashable in-home family PC, but by today’s standards, it isn’t especially mobile.Lenovo| Yoga 720$989BATTERYLOOKSPOWERVERSATILITYPROSCONSShallow keyboard; subpar speakersLight and flexible; often cheapest of the bunchSources: the company (photo);  WSJ analysis of the laptopThe Affordable OneLenovo Group Ltd.’s Yoga 720 has almost everything you’d want in a laptop, and I’ve seen it on sale for as little as $750. Its screen back flips to lie flat against the keyboard so you can hold it like a tablet. It’s fast enough, lasts long enough and looks good enough.My issues with the Yoga individually feel minor: The speakers sound mushy, the keyboard is a bit shallow, the design is bland. Together, they make clear why the 720 is cheaper than the others: It’s a good computer for the price, but if you spend more on something else, you’ll be glad.HP| Spectre x360$999BATTERYLOOKSPOWERVERSATILITYPROSCONSGets dirty easily; uneven keyboard backlightClean, attractive look; excellent keyboardSources: the company (photo); WSJ analysis of the laptopThe Best OneIf all you want is to stop reading and just buy a new computer, here’s your answer: The best $1,000 Windows computer is HP’s latest Spectre x360, a machine that does everything well. We’ve been recommending this line for a few years now, and HP just keeps improving it.The x360 checks all the spec boxes, looks as good as anything out of Cupertino, Calif., and is enjoyable to use, from the speakers to the keyboard. It has a 360-degree hinge that flips the laptop into a tablet for drawing or using in a cramped space. It uses new USB-C ports for charging and data, but also offers an older-style standard USB-A port.In my testing, the x360’s biggest problem has been the lid’s tendency to scuff in my bag. It came in third on my super-harsh battery test, behind the Surface Pro and nearly in line with the Dell: You should have no trouble using it through a workday. It’s not rich with new ideas about what computers can be, but when you have work to do, that isn’t the priority. You just want a laptop, and HP made a terrific one.Appeared in the March 28, 2018, print edition as 'Short-Listing Laptops in a Welter of Choices.'"
"PC Sales in U.S. Plunge as Smart Speakers, Etc. Take Consumer Dollars, Says Gartner","Updated Jan. 11, 2018 4:53 p.m. ET","Shipments of personal computers fell 2% in Q4, year over year, to 71.6 million units, capping a 2.8% decline for the year in total, according to the latest data today from research firm Gartner. It was the 13th quarter in a row of falling PC sales, and the sixth year in total that sales have dropped.Gartner finds some signs of optimism, it said, including rising sales In Asia-Pacific and Latin America.Sales in the U.S. showed a “steep decline,” said Gartner, falling 8%, year over year.Among top vendors, HP Inc. (HPQ) held onto its top spot in PCs, with year-over-year shipment growth of 6.6%, for a 16.1% share of the market. Lenovo (0992HK) held onto the second spot, despite seeing sales decline almost 1%. Sales at privately held Dell were up almost 1%, and Apple (AAPL) saw a 1.4% rise.In the U.S., HP had growth of just 1.6%, but second-place Dell saw a plunge of 12.3%. Apple’s (AAPL) sales, in third place at 13% share, declined 1.6%, but that was enough to give Apple a market share boost from the year-earlier 12.1% share. Lenovo’s sales in the U.S. were down a whopping 23.6%.Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa attributed the U.S. decline to PCs no longer being a holiday gift item, and too many other things competing for consumers’ dollars, such as voice-enabled speakers like Amazon's (AMZN) ""Echo"" devices: U.S. holiday sales were filled with popular products, such as voice-enabled speakers, and newly released smartphones. PCs simply could not compete against these gift items during the holiday season. We did see some consistent growth of gaming and high-end PCs."
