Warren Buffett Doesn't Buy Junk Stocks (but Maybe You Should),"Apr 5, 2013 at 8:30PM","Warren Buffett became the greatest investor of his generation by following a relatively simple philosophy: buying great companies at good prices. A look at Berkshire Hathaway's stock performance since 1990 clearly demonstrates Buffett's success.BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY PRICE CHART (1990-PRESENT). DATA BY YCHARTS.That said, it's harder than ever to find great companies at good prices today. The proliferation of information has made it easier to spot companies that have a durable competitive advantage of some sort, which tends to drive up their stock prices. For example, while I like Amazon.com's business, the company trades for more than 70 times forward earnings, far more than I'd be willing to pay. Furthermore, Buffett has a big advantage over ordinary investors today.  His past success opens up opportunities not available to the general public, such as access to preferred stock deals and private transactions.Dumpster diving for stocks!The difficulty of finding great companies at good prices can be discouraging for everyday investors. As a result, I often like to go dumpster-diving for stocks! While great companies are worth more than good companies, mediocre companies, and downright ""bad"" companies, every company has a value that's usually not zero (though there are exceptions!). If you can find an adequate margin of safety, you may be able to generate strong returns from owning not-so-strong companies. Don't believe me? Take a look at this stock chart:BBRY, BBY, DELL, AND HPQ: NOVEMBER 1-PRESENT, DATA BY YCHARTSThe above chart tracks the performance of four companies -- Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), Dell (UNKNOWN:DELL.DL), and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) -- vs. the S&P 500 since last November. Whereas the S&P 500 has gained nearly 10%, each of these four companies is up more than 50% in less than six months!You can rest assured that Warren Buffett would not touch any of these stocks, and not just because he does not like to invest in the tech sector. Best Buy has experienced stagnant sales and falling earnings for the past year or so, due to heavy competition from Amazon. Dell and HP have each seen their PC businesses cannibalized by Apple's iPad and other tablets. According to a recent Dell proxy filing, a Boston Consulting Group study concluded that Dell is likely to see a $10 billion drop in PC revenue over the next four years. HP has also seen disappointing results from most of its other business lines recently, and has experienced significant leadership turnover. BlackBerry was also a victim of Apple's rise, as it went from being the smartphone king to an also-ran in just a few short years. While shares have more than doubled since September, it is nevertheless true that, in two short years, the stock has dropped from $55 to $15.The big ideaOut of favor ""dumpster"" stocks can be great investing opportunities, because Wall Street tends to turn against these companies all at once. When problems first surface, analysts are often slow to recognize the severity of the threat. Once it becomes obvious that a company like HP or Best Buy is experiencing a significant decline in profitability, analysts rush to cut their ratings and price targets. The result is typically a steep fall in the stock price, which can lead analysts to cut their price targets yet again.By the end of this process, the stocks have been beaten down so much that value investors can frequently find very good bargains. At their lows last November, Best Buy, Dell, and HP were all trading for three-to-five times earnings. These prices implied that -- for all the problems these companies already faced -- investors expected the future to be much worse. For the stocks to rally, the companies merely needed to demonstrate that they were starting to stabilize their businesses.It should go without saying that a ""dumpster-diving' strategy wouldn't work for companies that are actually headed for bankruptcy.  However, HP, Dell, and Best Buy remained profitable in spite of their difficulties. In my analyses of HP and Best Buy last November (I wasn't actively covering Dell at the time), I found that both companies were trading for well below their long-term valuations.Recognize the risksWhile dumpster diving for stocks can be a profitable enterprise, investors should be ultra-cautious when investing in troubled companies. All of the dumpster stocks I highlighted above caused investors significant pain in the months and years prior to their recent rallies. There are a few ways to make sure you win more often than you lose.1) Margin of Safety: Always build in a big margin of safety when buying stock of a company with significant competitive challenges. Simply put, that means that you should try to calculate a very conservative estimate of what the company is worth, and only buy the stock if it drops (for example) 20%-30% below that conservative valuation. It's better to miss some opportunities than to overpay for a company with uncertain prospects.2) Start small: Don't bet your whole fortune on a dumpster stock you've just discovered, even if you think it is substantially undervalued. Start small, and if the price continues to drop, consider that as an opportunity to buy more.3) Be patient: It can take years for a stock to come in line with its ""intrinsic value."" While it's nice when dumpster stocks quickly spring back to life -- like the four I highlighted above -- this investing strategy requires taking a long-term view of what a company is worth. (I was very surprised at how quickly HP and Best Buy rebounded from their lows)4) Stay detached: Keep up to date on the company's fundamentals (particularly earnings performance), and make sure that nothing significant has changed from your initial evaluation of the stock. If the company's problems are much more severe than you anticipated, you need to be ready to cut your losses.5) Consider options strategies: Options are volatile investment vehicles compared to stocks, and are not suitable for beginning investors. However, if you understand how options work, they can be useful for investing in companies where it's hard to calculate the intrinsic value. For example, look at BlackBerry's earnings for the past three years:BLACKBERRY EPS, PAST THREE YEARS: DATA BY YCHARTSThrough 2010 and early 2011, BlackBerry appeared to have steadily rising earnings. Then, the QNX operating system (which eventually became BB10) was hit with multiple delays, BlackBerry's market share sank, and by mid-2012, the company was losing money. Call options allow you to minimize your downside in the event that things go south. That's a big advantage, since it's impossible to be right 100% of the time.Foolish conclusionDumpster diving for stocks should never be the ""bread and butter"" of your investing approach. By nature, it is somewhat more speculative than investing in higher-performing businesses, although the focus is still on long-term value. If you can find a great company at a good (or great) price, that should be your first investing target!  I think Apple might be such a company today.Nevertheless, sometimes it's hard to find many great companies at acceptable prices. In that case, investors with a long time horizon can profit from the market's occasional irrationality by investing in beaten-down stocks when Wall Street becomes overly pessimistic. Disagree?

Lessons of the Past for Boeing and HP Today,"Feb 1, 2013 at 11:30AM","On this day in economic and financial history...The early aviation industry was one of boundless promise for the right entrepreneurs. At first, it seemed the Wright Brothers might be the ones who dominated: They had the patents and the know-how. But less than two decades after their historic Kitty Hawk flight, the Wrights' company had merged with a primary competitor. No one had yet managed to turn aviation toward civilian uses, which would turn out to be far broader than the array of military aircraft built during aviation's early days.William Boeing was the dominating force the aviation industry had lacked. His company, formed in 1916 (the same year as the Wright merger), quickly became a leader in aircraft manufacturing, particularly in the growing field of civilian airmail delivery aircraft. By 1925 Boeing (NYSE:BA) expanded into airmail transport, and within four years this sprawling enterprise would become the de facto monopoly of the airline industry.On Feb. 1, 1929, Boeing Airplane and Transport Corporation became the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation. Within a year this new company (previously enhanced by the acquisition of another major air transport company) added Pratt & Whitney, some other notable aircraft and aircraft parts manufacturers, and National Air Transport, the first airline to provide cross-country service. William Boeing's new enterprise was now in control of the aviation industry, from the plant to the tarmac.United Aircraft and Transport also included big-name aviation companies like Sikorsky and Northrop in its roster. Its airline operations were rechristened United Air Lines (NYSE:UAL), and in the days before passenger transport was common, this subsidiary nevertheless managed to dominate airmail delivery. The United Aircraft and Transport empire quickly caught the eye of Congress, particularly after the Air Mail scandal became a public embarrassment for both the Hoover and Roosevelt administrations.Air mail would not have succeeded in the early years without government subsidy, which soon led to consolidation under three companies, including United Air Lines. This government-endorsed triparty monopoly -- and a series of fatal crashes in 1933 -- led to a Congressional investigation that produced the Air Mail Act of 1934. The Act barred the combination of manufacturing and transport operations and forced Boeing to break his enterprise apart. Boeing took the opportunity to step down from leadership and sold his stock in the company, which was quickly split into three of modern aviation's current leaders: transport company United Air Lines (now United Continental), Boeing, and United Aircraft, which became United Technologies. Boeing was to be the western manufacturing concern, and United Aircraft would build planes in the east.Both Boeing and United Technologies have been members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) for decades, which makes this one of three monopolies to see two post-divestiture companies inducted into the index. The others are Standard Oil, which is represented today by ExxonMobil and Chevron, and AT&T, which is represented by itself (though today's AT&T is more closely related to SBC Communications) and Verizon.We are all Keynesians nowJohn Maynard Keynes first published his landmark book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money in February of 1936. Arriving in the depths of the Great Depression, Keynes' General Theory led to a revolution in modern economic thought -- particularly with regard to employment and demand, but also with regard to consumption and investment. This wide-ranging, influential book can hardly be summarized properly here, but its legacy can most clearly be seen in some of the policies of the New Deal, as well as subsequent expansions of these policies following World War II. Nobel Laureate economist Paul Krugman is the current standard-bearer of a more modern Keynesian worldview, continuing the outspoken promotion of generally liberal economic policies for which Keynes is known.Thomas Edison, moviemakerThe ""Black Maria"" Kinetograph Theater film-production studio, the first of its kind in the United States, opened for business on Feb. 1, 1893. One of prolific inventor Thomas Edison's many business ventures, the Black Maria (pronounced ""Mah-RYE-uh"") was built at a cost of $637.67, or a little under $16,000 when adjusted for inflation. The studio was an unqualified success at popularizing Edison's kinetograph and kinetoscope, predecessors to modern film cameras and projectors. That May at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, Edison made his first demonstration of films shot at the Black Maria. A year after the studio's completion, the first film ever copyrighted was finished there, titled The Edison Kinetoscopic Record of a Sneeze. Here it is, in all its glory:The kinetoscope was quickly replaced by better technology, but it was a commercial success while it lasted. The first kinetoscope theater opened in New York in 1894, charging a quarter for admission. If patrons had paid that price to watch that sneeze, it would have cost them about five cents per second. In modern terms, that would be like paying $13,000 to watch The Hobbit. One hopes that moviegoers in Edison's day got more than five seconds for their quarter.Calculate your profitsHewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) unveiled the world's first handheld scientific calculator in February of 1972. The HP-35, so called because of its 35 keys, provided the technically inclined the ability to perform trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions with ease. It was the first HP product to contain both the integrated circuit and the light-emitting diode, and it had arisen out of co-founder Bill Hewlett's challenge to his engineers to take the company's existing desktop-sized calculator and shrink it down to fit in his pocket.At a cost of $395 (more than $2,000 today), the company expected few sales -- 10,000 would have been enough to recoup development costs. Instead, more than 300,000 calculators sold in its first three years on the market, and demand was so intense that the company had to warn eager buyers of potential shortages. The engineer's slide rule, a fixture at workplaces for decades, was soon rendered obsolete.10 better buys than the Dow Jones Industrial AverageWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

5 Leading Companies in Employee Relations,"Apr 18, 2013 at 1:36PM","Like most investors, you probably aim for the best possible return when picking potential investments. But as consumers increasingly clamor for companies to embrace social responsibility, good corporate citizenship is becoming a vital part of many companies' success. And it can boost the performance of our portfolios, too.CR magazine recently released its ""100 Best Corporate Citizens"" list for 2013, in which it rated members of the Russell 1000 large-cap index on 325 different elements related to responsible behavior. In the coming weeks, I'll delve into each of the seven categories that contribute to a company's overall score.Today, we'll look at the employee relations category, which gets a hefty 19.5% weighting. Here are some of the top-rated companies:Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)Gap (NYSE:GPS)Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ)Merck (NYSE:MRK)Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)To earn their high scores, the companies above engaged in a variety of good practices, including offering their employees benefits such as onsite recreation facilities, vision insurance, and adoption assistance, and disclosing the percentage of employees and managers who are women or members of a minority group.Digging deeperSo what, exactly, are these companies doing right? Here are a few examples of their employee-related practices:Intel offers a wide variety of generous benefits, and at Glassdoor.com, 83% of employees chiming in would recommend their employer to a friend. One interesting twist at Intel is that workers are routinely rotated into new positions every 18 to 24 months, to keep them learning new things. Its flexible work options include telecommuting, compressed workweeks, flextime, and more.At Gap, employees typically receive 20 to 35 days of paid time off, whether for illness, vacation, or personal time. Other benefits include discounts on company merchandise and on other items, too, such as computers, gym memberships, or flowers. There's also paternity pay and child care support. About 67% of workers would recommend their employer to a friend.Hewlett-Packard has been struggling in recent years, making generous benefits all the more important, in order to attract and retain workers. (It's not always enough, as attested by only 41% of employees recommending the company to friends, per Glassdoor.com.) Along with the usual suspects (401(k) matching up to 4%, dental and vision insurance, adoption assistance, and more), it offers discounts on a wide variety of expenses, such as hotels, insurance, and company products.Merck offers some workers a benefit that's hard to find these days -- a traditional pension. It has also boosted the percentage of women in executive roles from 25% to 35% between 2009 and 2011, and per its own ""Culture Survey,"" 49% of its workers are ""engaged"" or ""fully engaged."" About 64% of its employees would recommend it to a friend, per Glassdoor.com.Cisco's benefits have led to its being included in Fortune's list of ""Best Companies to Work For"" for the past 16 years in a row. Its percentage of female workers is 22%, down a little over the past few years, and 82% of workers express satisfaction with their workplace. About 76% of workers would recommend their employer to a friend, per Glassdoor.com.Earning well while doing goodCompanies doing good, such as treating their employees well, can boost your portfolio's performance. And various other studies have suggested that socially responsible investments are at least competitive with the overall market, if not outperforming it on occasion. That's a solid motivation for even the most coolly rational investors to take social responsibility to heart.If you're in the market for solid socially responsible candidates for your portfolio, check out the real-money portfolio run by my colleague Alyce Lomax. Out of all the Fool portfolios in the group, hers was recently in first place."
DreamWorks Animation: Where Innovation and Imagination Collide,"Mar 5, 2013 at 6:00PM","Chances are if you have kids, or you're just a kid at heart, you're quite familiar with DreamWorks Animation (NASDAQ:DWA). DreamWorks, an animated film company headed by CEO and co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg, has delivered 25 films in total to date including the Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and Madagascar series.Last week, the company reported its fourth-quarter earnings results and, to be quite frank, it wasn't its finest hour.Kung fu profitsFor the quarter, revenue jumped 21% to $264.7 million thanks in large part to the continued success of Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted, which contributed $95.2 million in post-box-office sales, and its library, which added an additional $63.4 million. Unfortunately, production costs more than doubled to $354 million and DreamWorks reported a $0.98 quarterly loss.Most of the blame lay with Rise of the Guardians, which cost $145 million to produce but only generated $302 million in sales, to date. All told, Rise of the Guardians cost DreamWorks $87 million in writedowns and will be the impetus that results in 350 full-time employees being laid off -- about 15% of DreamWorks' full-time staff. Investors can take news like this in one of two ways: as a sign that DreamWorks has lost its luster, or as an incredible opportunity to invest in a rapidly evolving animation company.How to train your portfolioAs you might guess by my analysis of DreamWorks and its CEO just last month, I see a lot of value in DreamWorks' future based on the company's past performance and its strength in leadership. As I noted previously, in spite of producing just 25 animated films, DreamWorks boasts four of the top 50 grossing movies of all time! To me this demonstrates that what DreamWorks is doing is more than just luck -- it's a reflection of workers having the right tools, and the company having the right talent, to get the job done right.In a case of incredible timing, while on vacation in California last month, I received a call from Jeffery Katzenberg inviting me to tour DreamWorks' five-building campus to get a better feel for what investments the company had made in terms of technology to streamline and improve its animations. Needless to say, the technology and software upgrades being utilized by DreamWorks helped build up my overall image of the company from just a rear-looking success story to one that looks primed for success moving forward.Rise of the technologyMy guided tour through DreamWorks' campus hit on many points, from the theater to animation aspects, even stopping off at the company's data center. Below, I'll attempt to share some of my key takeaways from my experience at DreamWorks.SOURCE: SEAN WILLIAMS.But before we jump headfirst into what makes DreamWorks tick, I think a brief overview of the production process itself will help shed some light on the challenges a company like DreamWorks faces on a daily basis, and how it's investing heavily now in newer technologies to overcome those obstacles.According to Kate Swanborg, DreamWorks' technology executive and head of enterprise marketing  -- my ""question answerer extraordinaire"" over the course of two hours -- each animation takes approximately five years to make, involves an average investment of $130 million, requires about 200 terabytes of storage space, and includes 60 million to 80 million render hours! In spite of these impressive tallies, only 3-5 seconds of animation are produced in a given week. This might seem painstakingly slow from a numbers perspective, but it's a requirement if DreamWorks hopes to keep its competitive edge over Disney's (NYSE:DIS) Pixar.At the heart of DreamWorks' transformation is a completely revamped hardware and software system capable of giving developers at any stage of the production process almost instant feedback.On the hardware side, DreamWorks began partnering with Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) as early as 2001. Since then, it's built on this partnership to include a full line of Z800 and Z820 workstations with 100 gigabytes of RAM. Previous workstation models weren't allowing employees to fully utilize the memory and processing capacity of HP's workstations, which ultimately held them back. That isn't the case with the newer models, which are more fully utilizing the upgraded processing and memory capacity and translating into more efficiently produced films.On the software side, DreamWorks shifted away from Emo software to the considerably more user-friendly Primo software. Primo allows DreamWorks' animators to seamlessly turn their imagination loose with the end result being instant feedback that wasn't available with Emo's software.SOURCE: SEAN WILLIAMS.Combining the two processes are 20,000 CPU cores in one of its three big data centers -- one of which is pictured below in Glendale, Calif.SOURCE: SEAN WILLIAMS.These data centers allow for scalable multicore processing and brought DreamWorks screaming into the 21st century by making all of its data cloud-enabled. If you want to be brutally simple, computer-generated animation is a massive collection of data, and DreamWorks' new software and huge data center investments have made it such that any person in the production process can gain access to, or provide feedback on, a developing animation from any desktop, anywhere! In fact, about 20% of all rendering nowadays is done offsite! This combination of new hardware and software has put the ball back in the animators' courts.Another separating factor for DreamWorks is its reliance on 3-D technology. Although 3-D televisions failed to take off as expected in consumer households, the 3-D experience in the movie theater remains a traffic driver. DreamWorks, rather than relying on previous animation techniques in the 1990s that superimposed 3-D on moviegoers in the theater, produces all of its movies in 3-D from the start which creates a richer (and non-nauseating!) movie from start to finish.The prince of DreamWorksAs a truly exceptional conclusion to my technology-focused tour, I was able to spend 15 minutes chatting with CEO and co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg.SOURCE: SEAN WILLIAMS.As you might imagine, we spoke briefly about the various technologies that were introduced over the past couple of years, but I had two more pressing questions that technology wizard Kate Swanborg and I didn't touch on.To begin with, I was curious about Katzenberg's views on how mobile computing may transform his business and what actions his company might be taking to prepare for the transition. To that end, Katzenberg expounded that ""It's our future. It's a valuable new form of expression that will completely repurpose intellectual property and our characters.""One of the more intriguing moments of our conversation on the ongoing mobile transformation revolved around his view of how we may pay for content in the future:Ten years from now [similar to how consumers in India watch content on their mobile phones] we might be paying for content by the square inch. For instance, watching a movie on a mobile phone may cost $0.69; on a tablet, perhaps $0.99. If you watch that same movie on a 60-inch television, it might cost $4.99. It's a revolutionary time for how content is made available.As you might imagine, Katzenberg and I also got on the subject of my article highlighting him as an incredible CEO. I asked him to expand a bit on what provoked him to supply such amazing perks to his employees. Katzenberg had this to say:If people are in love with their work, and you give them the best tools available and surround them with a healthy environment, and celebrate their accomplishments and milestones, then we all win! Many of these people here are 29 years old and they're not looking out for their health. It's our job to do that for them, because keeping them healthy is good business.And this is precisely why I highlight exceptional CEOs on a weekly basis -- to bring proactive-thinking leaders to investors' attention.The Crood realityBefore my tour, I had a respect for DreamWorks and understood that its past dealings had made the company successful. When I left, I better understood how the company has completely transformed its business and positioned itself for long-term success.DreamWorks laid the groundwork for its in-home and marketing successes over the last couple of years, which should give it an edge over Disney's Pixar in the long run. In 2011 it signed a streaming content deal with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the king of streaming content, to bring its animations into family households. More recently, Netflix and DreamWorks announced they'd be teaming up to introduce a new children's series known as Turbo: F.A.S.T and modeled after its CG animation Turbo due out later this year. In terms of advertising, DreamWorks snagged McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), the world's largest restaurant chain and arguably one of the most recognizable brands globally, to an exclusive 10-year deal in 2007, ending Disney's 10-year partnership with the brand. In return for in-store promotion of its upcoming animations, DreamWorks supplies McDonald's with co-branded marketing materials and videos.  The next big test for DreamWorks comes in less than three weeks when it releases The Croods. If history serves as any indicator, and based on the innovations I was shown, I fully expect this movie to be a success.The company's ambitious plans, which could have it producing up to three CG animations annually, currently has it valued at just 18 times forward earnings. Given its content and marketing partnerships, as well as its superior leadership and revolutionary technology, I feel investors could be getting an extraordinary deal at these levels. As such, I plan to place a CAPScall of outperform on DreamWorks to demonstrate my strong belief that it's an exceptional value. "
Origin Stories of 3 of the World's Largest Companies,"Mar 3, 2013 at 11:00AM","On this day in economic and financial history ...AT&T (NYSE:T) was first incorporated as the American Telephone and Telegraph Company on March 3, 1885. At first, it was a subsidiary of American Bell and was tasked with the construction and operation of the nation's first long-distance telephone network. AT&T proved so successful at this task that it soon eclipsed its corporate parent in importance. AT&T became the heart of the Bell System when it acquired American Bell's assets in 1899. By this point its long-distance lines, originating in New York, were already well established in Chicago and were building gradually toward a transcontinental network that could link New York with California, and all points in between.AT&T became a transcontinental telephone monopoly in 1915 with the completion of the first call between New York City and San Francisco. Though thousands of local telecom competitors had sprung up between AT&T's buyout of American Bell and its completion of the transcontinental lines, none could match Ma Bell's reach, and it continued to be the dominant operator for decades. AT&T became part of the 20-component Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) a year after inaugurating transcontinental telephony. It was removed in 1928, a year after becoming the first telecom to offer trans-Atlantic telephone service between the United States and the British Isles, but it was reinstated in 1939 and has remained ever since.Between 1939 and 1984 (the year of its antitrust divestiture), AT&T became one of the largest and best-recognized companies in the United States. Telephone service reached 50% of the country in 1945 and rose to 90% in 1969. AT&T controlled nearly all of this service, thanks in part to what was essentially a government-endorsed monopoly allowed as a result of the Department of Justice's failed antitrust suit of 1956. The consent decree that followed AT&T's antitrust victory gave it largely free rein over American telephone service but barred it from participating in the nascent computer industry, clearing the way for fellow Dow component and onetime tech competitor IBM to become a dominant force in computing.Another antitrust effort (the third of AT&T's lifetime) proved successful in 1983, breaking Ma Bell into multiple regional operators. The AT&T you now know was once SBC Communications, which began as the regional Bell in Texas, Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. It acquired the original AT&T in 2005 and adopted its name and branding shortly afterward.The once and future king (of beers)Interbrew and AmBev announced their intent to merge on March 3, 2004, in a deal that would see the combined company leapfrog global beer leader Anheuser-Busch to become the world's largest brewer by volume. The end result of the merger was a company with roughly $12.5 billion in annual sales and a 14% share of the global beer industry, spanning 140 countries. In 20 of these countries, including six of the seven fastest-growing markets, the new company would be the largest or second-largest brewer.Four years later, InBev made an offer Anheuser-Busch couldn't refuse to become Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) in 2009, by far the world's largest brewer. This newly enhanced company produced roughly 20% of the world's beer a year after its merger was completed.So that's what the H-S-B-C stands forThe Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Company opened the doors of its first branch on March 3, 1865, in Hong Kong. Founded by Scotsman Thomas Sutherland shortly after the Opium War, the bank quickly became a prominent British-led bank in the Far East, opening a Shanghai branch a month later and a branch in Japan a year after that. For more than a century, Hongkong and Shanghai grew throughout Asia, which was only briefly interrupted by the Japanese during World War II. The bank developed a truly global presence in the postwar period by opening or acquiring branches in the United States, the Middle East, India, Canada, Australia, and Britain.In 1991, these divergent banks reorganized under the umbrella of holding company HSBC (NYSE:HSBC), which is now headquartered in London. This banking titan was the world's second-largest bank in 2012, its $2.55 trillion in assets trailing only the holdings of Germany's Deutsche Bank.HP was an early adopter onceHewlett -Packard (NYSE:HPQ) became only the ninth dot-com domain name holder in history on March 3, 1986, when it registered hp.com. The only older domain names still used for their original purpose are Xerox's xerox.com and SRI International's sri.com, both of which were registered less than two months earlier. HP's domain name was then the first two-letter domain name ever registered, at a time when commercial Internet service providers did not yet exist. Fewer than 10,000 networks were accessible at the time, whereas millions upon millions of networks now operate around the world. HP's domain registration was a rare example of forward thinking at minimal cost. Unfortunately, most business decisions are a great deal more difficult.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

"The Dow, Year to Date","Feb 18, 2013 at 6:00PM","Year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) is crushing it. The index is up 6.7% in just a little more than a month and a half, after finishing the previous 12 months up just 7.26%. Only one of the Dow's 30 components is in the red for the year after five closed lower in 2012. While there's still a long way to go and anything could happen, the index looks for now as if it will easily perform better in 2013 than it did in 2012.Noteworthy 2013 movesSo far in 2013, the only underwater Dow stock is Boeing (NYSE:BA). The company came into the year with great momentum, and after a number of years of delaying new aircraft deliveries, many believed that this would finally be Boeing's time to shine. But after just six peaceful days in 2013, things started falling apart. A battery problem caused a 787 Dreamliner to catch on fire in Boston, followed by a string of issues with other 787s around the world. The FAA grounded the entire fleet over the battery mishap, and investigators have been working diligently since then to fix the problem. Yet even with all these woes, Boeing has lost a mere 0.44% this year.As for 2012's worst Dow performer, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) is the Dow's top stock so far this year, gaining 17.82% after losing 44.68% of its value in 2012. The company's financials haven't changed from 2012 to 2013, so it's likely that investors have been pouring into the stock because they think shares were taken too low in 2012. As my Fool colleague Evan Niu pointed out in ""1 Chart That Proves the PC Is Dead,"" the whole industry has seen growth rates flatline over the past few years, which clearly gives the HP bears plenty of fuel to bash the company. But recent developments may give the bulls some ammunition to fight back.For years, computing devices ran almost exclusively on Microsoft's Windows platform. But with the advent of tablets and smartphones, Windows' tech domination has been decreasing. Apple, of course, has its own operating system, and Google's open Android system can be found on a number of devices -- and now it'll be coming to HP. On Feb. 4, the company announced that it will make a Chromebook, essentially a dumbed-down laptop that runs on Google's operating system, rather than on Windows. The Chromebook can't perform all the functions of a traditional computer, but it can run nearly all the same applications one would find on a tablet.The relationship between Google and HP doesn't look as though it will end with the Chromebook, either, as HP has plans for an Android tablet and possibly a smartphone. As HP moves more into the Google-Android world, the company should find more opportunities in the future. I'm still not convinced that HP is on the right track, but the stock clearly has support from Wall Street and enough momentum to keep pushing the stock higher in 2013. For now, I'll gladly sit on the sidelines and watch the PC manufacturers fight for market share with their nearly identical products. Sure, HP may be on to something here, and if Google ever produces a PC operating system comparable to a Windows product, that may be enough to lure consumers back to HP.10 better buys than the Dow Jones Industrial AverageWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

The Truth About American-Made Vehicles,"Apr 21, 2013 at 1:00PM","I keep hearing rumblings from consumers and investors about how Toyota (NYSE:TM) and Honda (NYSE:HMC) vehicles are more American made than those from Ford (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM), or Chrysler. So many people seem to believe this that I had to look into it myself. A simple search turned up a Cars.com ""American-made index,"" which indeed declared that four of the top five most American made vehicles were Japanese models.Fortunately for you readers -- and Detroit -- I was skeptical and dug deeper. The truth is that Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler are much more American made and the Cars.com index is deeply flawed. Here's what you need to know about buying American-made vehicles, and why it's important for consumers and investors.FlawedThe Cars.com index takes in to account whether cars are assembled here, the percentage of domestic parts used, and whether they're bought in large numbers. I scratch my head a little bit at that last factor. I understand that the point is to discount vehicles that could be 100% made here yet sell only 10 units. But in reality, there are much better factors to consider when measuring for the most American-made vehicles.In addition, the Cars.com index seems to minimize the importance of domestic parts bought. GM doesn't have a single car in the top five of the index, yet consider that GM alone buys as many U.S. parts as Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Subaru, Mitsubishi, and all other Japanese automakers combined. Surprised? Wait -- it gets better.Another thing the index fails to recognize is where the companies are headquartered. While the Japanese automakers do have plants and offices here, they aren't headquartered where the majority of their R&D money is spent. Detroit's Big Three are all headquartered here and have eight times the numbers of workers here that Toyota, Honda, and Nissan do. Detroit spends more on R&D here in the U.S. per year than juggernaut companies such as Boeing, Intel, Google, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, and ExxonMobil -- again, combined. Made and sold hereWhile the Cars.com index uses volume in its calculation, it does so in a flawed way. Wouldn't you rather calculate which vehicles that are made in the U.S. and also sold here? The data ignores that Detroit's Big Three, on average, sell one and a half times as many U.S.-made vehicles into the U.S. market as its foreign counterparts do.At this point, I decided to scrap the Cars.com index, and I found a much better study done by Prof. Frank DuBois of the Kogod School of Business at American University. This study viewed 253 cars, trucks, and SUVs to determine which had the most domestic content. It took into account labor, R&D, inventory, capital spent, engine parts, transmission parts, body, interior, chassis, electrical, and profits.Tied at the top of this list, with a score of 88.5 out of a 100, were the Buick Enclave, Chevy Traverse, and GMC Acadia, which were all made in Michigan. Ford's F-Series -- the No. 1 truck in the U.S. -- was tied for second, with the Dodge Avenger at 87.5. Next up were two American muscle icons -- the Mustang and Corvette -- with a score of 85. You have to go down to a score of 81 to find the first foreign vehicle -- the Toyota Avalon. These results are a world away from the Cars.com index, yet, in my opinion, are much more accurate.Buy AmericanThe best thing that could happen for Ford and GM investors is for the American public to once again back our automotive industry and actually buy American. Our auto industry supports nearly 8 million U.S. jobs and is expected to hire as many as 34,000 more workers over the next five years -- led by Ford and GM.But while some consumers still think Japanese cars are as American-made as American cars are, others don't buy American because they think our vehicles are still poorer in quality. Consider this: Since 2010, Toyota and Honda have the most recalls of any automaker. Moreover, Toyota, previously known for its industry-leading quality, has more recalls than the No. 2 and 3 spots combined, or GM tripled.Ford and GM aren't the same two companies that pumped out terrible vehicles and had management that ran themselves into the ground. Both are producing quality and, most importantly, American-made vehicles.Maybe it's time to give Detroit a second chance."
Does Apple Have a Little Inventory Problem?,"Mar 5, 2013 at 7:30PM","If there's one thing that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) hates, it's inventory. CEO Tim Cook has long voiced his belief that inventory is evil, comparing it to running a dairy business where products spoil quickly. The latest rumor on Apple supply chain happenings is that the Mac maker is running into a bit of an inventory problem with components. Is this cause for concern?Not quiteDIGITIMES is reporting that component shipments related to the new iMacs saw a big drop in February, with March shipments expected to similarly be below January levels. This comes even as Apple is reporting now overcoming manufacturing challenges with the redesigned all-in-one desktop and domestic Mac shipments are estimated to have jumped 31% in January.Like other supply chain rumors, any single data point should be taken with an entire salt shaker. Apple may very likely have plenty of iMac components sitting around while overall assembly is bottlenecked by the laminated display process. Only recently has Apple seemed to have cleared these manufacturing hurdles. Just days ago, shipping times on the iMac were being quoted in weeks. Those shipping times rather suddenly dropped to one to three days and now new orders for standard configurations ship within 24 hours. Those are positive for Mac units this quarter, especially following the disappointing Mac figure last quarter.Apple frequently makes hefty component prepayments to secure supply and only utilizes these prepayments when it needs to. For reference, Apple closed out 2012 with $3.9 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding after utilizing $323 million worth of them during the quarter.The fact still stands that Apple's actual inventory management (not components) is unrivaled, which you can see from its incredibly high inventory turnover of 71.1. Compare that to PC rivals like Hewlett-Packard, whose inventory turnover is just 13.4. Apple may have extra components idling by, but all that matters is that iMac shipments are on the rise.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

1 Important Way Intel Still Tops Qualcomm,"Mar 28, 2013 at 7:00PM","No two companies embody the shift of traditional computing to mobile form factors like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The two chip makers are two sides of a silicon coin, where one dominates the market for PC processors while the other is the go-to vendor for mobile chips.Late last year, there was a symbolic changing of the guard when Qualcomm's market cap overtook Intel's for the first time ever. In the months since, Qualcomm has slightly widened its lead, but both companies are worth right around $110 billion.QCOM MARKET CAP DATA BY YCHARTS.Intel continues to face headwinds, as the PC market that it relies on remains weak, while Qualcomm's licensing and chip businesses are both sitting pretty amid global consumer adoption of mobile devices.However, there's still one important way in which Intel still tops Qualcomm.Intel InsideWhen the average consumer thinks PC processor, they immediately think Intel. Intel has dominated the market for PC chips for decades, with smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices always playing second fiddle. With such long-standing hegemony comes strong brand recognition.In Interbrand's 2012 ranking of the best global brands, Intel ranked No. 8. Qualcomm didn't even crack the top 100. The consultancy valued Intel's brand at nearly $40 billion.While Qualcomm's technology is found inside nearly every single mobile phone in the world in some form or fashion -- either through licensing its intellectual property portfolio or one of its mobile chips (applications processors and baseband modems) -- most consumers may not even realize it. Even fewer care.The market for mobile chips is more competitive than PCs, and there is also a higher level of integration among device OEMs where chips are designed in-house. Qualcomm enjoys a revenue share of over 40% in the applications processor market, but that's only part of the bigger picture, as companies like Apple and Samsung, the two largest smartphone vendors, are increasingly moving toward in-house chips.That's one reason why Qualcomm can't command the same level of brand recognition as Intel. It's not as if Hewlett-Packard or Dell ever made their own PC processors.Snapdragon Inside?In a recent interview with MIT Technology Review, Qualcomm chief marketing officer Anand Chandrasekher addressed how he hopes to change that. The exec spent 18 years at Intel and only joined Chipzilla's rival last year.Part of the problem is that Qualcomm has historically not marketed directly to consumers, something that Intel did from the get-go with its iconic ""Intel Inside"" campaign that put its name directly on the outside of every PC sporting one of its processors. Smartphones with Qualcomm's logo directly on them are few and far between, in part because there's physically less space to put a sticker on, according to Chandrasekher.Qualcomm now wants to push its Snapdragon brand more aggressively, which is one of its more recognizable products. You may have started to see Snapdragon commercials touting battery life mixed in with your regularly scheduled programming, but probably only relatively recently.Chandrasekher considers his company a ""$100-billion-plus company, in terms of market cap, that nobody knows."" Appealing directly to consumers is a tough proposition, though, because many may not be familiar with the technical details of why Snapdragons are superior to the competition -- that pitch is for the OEMs building devices.Onward and upwardQualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs also hosted the opening keynote at this year's Consumer Electronics Show, hoping that would gain it some mindshare with consumers. Too bad the presentation was so weird that most people were left confused and wondering what Big Bird, Desmond Tutu, vampire attacks, and Star Trek have to do with Qualcomm.The marketing exec acknowledged that the CES event didn't go so well, but that the company continues to learn how to better market itself to convey its value proposition directly to consumers. It might take a long time and a ton of marketing money, but can Qualcomm ever match Intel's brand?"
Why Is Amazon Dropping Kindle Fire Prices?,"Mar 24, 2013 at 10:00AM","Last week, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced that it was reducing the price of its Kindle Fire HD 8.9-inch tablet from $299 to $269, while also cutting the price of the LTE version from $499 to $399. In the press release, Amazon stated that the launch of those tablets in Europe and Japan allowed the company to increase production volumes and therefore lower prices. However, this announcement should be taken with a grain of salt. It is much more likely that weak sales of the 8.9-inch Kindle Fire devices led to the price cut. While Amazon has generally tried to sell its tablets at cost, the 8.9-inch devices were previously priced to be profitable. With the failure of that strategy, Amazon seems to be reverting to its primary strategy of pricing tablets at cost and hoping to sell content at a profit.Who wants a $500 Kindle Fire?Other vendors, such as Motorola (Xoom), BlackBerry (Playbook), and Hewlett-Packard (TouchPad), have previously tried to compete with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the upscale tablet market. Each of those would-be iPad competitors flopped at the $499 price point. Even at greatly reduced prices, none of these tablets were able to come close to the iPad's sales volume.Despite this harsh lesson, Amazon decided to attempt a $499 tablet last year. The highlight of Amazon's high-end tablet was a 4G LTE modem, and an option for customers to buy a discounted $49.99 basic data plan for the first year. Amazon also introduced an 8.9-inch Wi-Fi version of the Kindle Fire HD for $299. The Kindle Fire HD 8.9-inch began shipping on Nov. 15, with the LTE model shipping the week thereafter.As early as December (one month after the launch of the Kindle Fire HD), analysts began warning that demand for the 8.9-inch Kindle Fire models was very weak. One analyst estimated that Amazon sold 6 million tablets in the holiday quarter, with most of those being the $199 Kindle Fire HD 7-inch. (Amazon has not released official sales statistics for the Kindle Fire tablets.) While some analysts had expected the new Kindle Fires to steal market share from Apple, the reverse seems to have occurred. Apple introduced the iPad Mini shortly after the Kindle Fire HD launch, with a starting price of $329. With a 7.9-inch screen, the iPad Mini is in between the two Kindle Fire HD size options. Apple reportedly expects to sell 55 million iPad minis in 2013. The iPad Mini's runaway popularity suggests that customers comparing it to the Kindle Fire HD 8.9-inch are overwhelmingly willing to sacrifice on screen size (and pay an extra $30) to get the iPad's superior overall experience.Enter price cutsBy cutting its prices to $269 and $399 for the Wi-Fi and LTE 8.9-inch tablets, Amazon will put a little more distance between itself and Apple, price-wise. As analyst Colin Gillis of BGC Partners recently argued, the price cut may be designed to stimulate demand in the seasonally weak first half of the year. More broadly, it confirms that demand was either weak all along, or fell off dramatically after the holiday season. By contrast, Amazon's claim that the addition of new markets is allowing lower prices does not make very much sense. Tablet sales peak in the seasonally strong fourth quarter, so the launch of the Kindle Fire HD 8.9-inch in Europe and Japan will (at best) offset seasonally weak demand in the U.S. Worldwide sales of the Kindle Fire HD 8.9-inch will be flat to down sequentially.Only iPads earn a profitThere may be a grain of truth in Amazon's explanation for the price cuts: It probably can break even (or even earn a small profit) on its tablets at their new, lower prices. According to a bill of materials estimate by TechInsights, the components for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9-inch may cost as little as $179, or $218 for the LTE version. These estimates do not include the manufacturing cost or logistics costs, but should otherwise be roughly accurate (Amazon is also probably subsidizing the data plan for the first year). For comparison, TechInsights estimated the bill of materials for the base model Kindle Fire HD 7-inch at $148.These cost estimates imply that if Amazon was breaking even on the Kindle Fire HD 7-inch, it was earning a significant per-unit profit on both versions of the Kindle Fire HD 8.9-inch. Last week's price cut probably wiped out most of that profit margin. Once again, we are learning that while vendors other than Apple can sell tablets in respectable quantities, only Apple can earn a significant profit in the tablet business.What's next?Amazon's inability to penetrate the high-end tablet market may be pushing its focus back to finding the lowest imaginable price points. On Wednesday, TechCrunch reported that Amazon is preparing a $99 tablet for release later this year. While Amazon seemed to refute that rumor later in the day, it is still quite possible that Amazon will reduce prices again this fall when it refreshes the Kindle Fire lineup. It's not clear how this strategy is going to help Amazon, though. Thus far, putting lots of cheap tablets in the hands of consumers has not generated enough content sales to prevent a significant drop in revenue growth. Amazon's tablet strategy may be running out of gas.Should Amazon be on your buy list? It's on ours...Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

It's Time to Buy Xerox Stock. Here's Why.,"May 26, 2013 at 11:45AM","It might not be obvious to the casual observer, but right now, today, Xerox (NYSE:XRX) stock offers one of the best values available in the IT industry. Why?Three reasons.Xerox stock is cheapWhen you stack up Xerox stock against two of its rivals in the international ""business process outsourcing"" industry -- Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) -- it's clear that Xerox is one of the cheapest options out there. Its 9.7 price-to-earnings ratio falls 32% below the P/E of IBM. It sells for a whopping 45% discount to the price of a share of Accenture.And as is so often the case, with a low valuation comes a big boost in dividend yield. Xerox stock currently yields a tidy 2.6% dividend. That's as compared with Accenture and IBM, both of which yield less than 2%.Xerox: A cheap price for low expectationsWhy aren't investors paying up for Xerox stock (yet)? Part of the reason, one presumes, is because no one's expecting the stock to do very much over the next five years. Of the three firms named, Xerox currently sports the lowest projected growth rate.But while that sounds bad, if you turn this fact on its head, low expectations might actually turn out to be good news for investors in Xerox stock. After all, if no one's expecting much growth out of the company, then Xerox has a low hurdle to clear.It has to be easier for Xerox stock to exceed expectations for 6.7% earnings growth, after all, than it will be for Accenture to deliver better than 11.4% growth. (And with sales growth alone having averaged 5.4% annually over the past five years, there's every reason to believe Xerox can at least hit its targets going forward).Xerox stock pays you bestPerhaps most important to investors, though, is the simple fact that out of the three big IT companies discussed here, Xerox is the one generating the most cash from its business -- and it gives you the biggest free cash flow bang for your buck.Measured by dividing a company's market capitalization (the price you pay for Xerox stock) into its free cash flow (the money your investment generates for you), Xerox offers investors easily the best ""free cash flow yield"" of the three companies named. Put even more simply, for every $1 you invest in a share of Xerox stock today, you can expect the company to generate nearly 17.4 cents worth of real, cash profits on your investment.XRX FREE CASH FLOW YIELD DATA BY YCHARTSXerox may ultimately use this cash to pay you bigger dividends (although its 2.6% dividend is already pretty big), to buy back shares (increasing the size of your stake in the company for every share it takes off the table), or to reinvest in its business and maintain its lead over rivals for years to come. Any way you look at it, though, Xerox's ability to generate cash offers investors a great reason to invest.And that, Fools, is the reason I think now's a great time to buy Xerox stock."
Is Hewlett-Packard a Great Stock for today's Dividend Investor?,"Jun 5, 2013 at 2:03PM","It's no secret that Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) is in trouble. The inveterate computing giant suffers from the waning PC market like many other sector titans, but that downtrend came at a particularly bad time for this company. HP is still reeling from the revolving-door management policy since ex-CEO Mark Hurd left the company in shambles, and current leader Meg Whitman admits that putting the pieces back together is both difficult and time-consuming.Sales are shrinking. GAAP earnings have turned negative. Share prices are down 47% in the last three trouble years, taking 168 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) in the process. The market capitalization has dwindled from more than $100 billion to the third-smallest cap on the Dow.HPQ MARKET CAP DATA BY YCHARTS.So the storm clouds are building on HP's immediate horizon. But all is not lost -- not yet.With all of these standard metrics collapsing at once, it's easy to overlook HP's bright spots. In particular, the free-falling share price and last year's huge earnings writedown combine to mask the fact that cash flows took a sharp turn in the right direction.HPQ FREE CASH FLOW TTM DATA BY YCHARTS.HP generated $9.9 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters. That's a middling performance among the elite companies on the Dow (16 out of 30, to be exact) but a stellar result in relation to the wider market. HP's free cash machine places in the top 5% of the S&P 500, for example.Pair this fountain of cash with an admittedly not-so-buoyant history of dividend increases, and you'll see that HP spent just 10.7% of its free cash to fuel that 2.4% dividend yield. That's the third-lowest cash-payout ratio on the Dow, where financial specialists are always rolling in piles of fresh cash. The lowest cash ratio, for reference, goes to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) -- a paltry 6.8% of its free cash flows go to income investors. But the megabank is still waiting for government approval to raise its payouts, and most of its business takes place below the free-cash-flow line on its enormously complicated financial statements. It's a very different situation at HP, where cash flows form the most important bottom line of all, and no regulator is keeping its dividend policies back.Dividend investors might wonder what would happen if HP's board authorized a more generous set of increases, given all that cash-based headroom. In fact, Whitman and other recent HP chiefs have supported that strategy, while Mark Hurd largely left it untouched. Dividend payouts have jumped 82% in three years after flatlining for years.HPQ DIVIDEND DATA BY YCHARTS.So HP's cash flows are surging, largely ignored, with plenty of headroom to increase dividend payouts even further. This moderate yield could -- and arguably should -- spike, even if the turnaround story doesn't play out. That makes HP an intriguing pick for dividend investors with their eyes on the Dow 30."
"How Falling Server Sales Affect HP, IBM, and Intel","Dec 10, 2013 at 3:00PM","With the growth of cloud computing, the traditional server market has lost its cash cow status for many companies. IDC estimates that server sales fell by 3.7% year-over-year in the third quarter, thanks largely to big web companies designing their own servers and having them built by contract manufacturers. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), the top two server manufacturers, have seen margins decline due to this trend, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the dominant server chip provider, has had to adapt to this changing market.Proprietary no moreIn the old days, companies simply bought servers from companies like HP, IBM, and Dell, and those providers were able to achieve solid margins in the server business. But, as cloud computing has taken off, with the so-called ""big four"" cloud companies -- Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft -- rapidly growing their capacity, server companies are increasingly being cut out of the loop. These cloud companies are designing their own servers, buying chips directly from Intel, then farming manufacturing off to Asia.Four years ago, 75% of Intel's server chip revenue came from Dell, HP, and IBM. Today, that same 75% is split between eight companies, one of which is Google. It's clear that the market has already shifted dramatically, and Intel has a dedicated salesperson for each of these big cloud customers. Small companies that don't need a huge number of servers and don't want to trust their data to a public cloud will likely remain customers of HP, IBM, and Dell, but the proprietary server business is certainly shrinking.What this means for HPThe No. 1 server vendor, HP, stands to lose the most from these trends. The company derives a significant portion of its profits from server sales, and although HP picked up share in Q3, operating margin continued to decline. The slight increase in revenue from this gain in share likely means nothing long-term, and I see no reason to believe that the server profits will stabilize any time soon.HP's enterprise group, which is responsible for servers, accounted for 45% of the company's fiscal 2013 non-GAAP operating profit. Operating margin, which sat near 19% in Q4 of 2011, has fallen to 14.5% in Q4 of 2013. What's worse, HP has no other businesses that can make up for these falling profits. Companywide, revenue and profits are declining in almost every division. As server profits slowly dry up, it's hard to imagine where growth is supposed to come from.What this means for IBMThe No. 2 server vendor is IBM, a company which sells servers based on both the x86 architecture from Intel and its own Power architecture. IBM's server sales collapsed last quarter, likely allowing HP to pick up share, but IBM has a robust, highly profitable business without relying on hardware sales.Last quarter, IBM had a service backlog of $141 billion, up 6% year-over-year. The company is constantly shifting out of low-margin businesses to focus on high-margin opportunities, and it has become very good at maximizing and growing profits. The IBM of today looks very different from the IBM of 2000, as can be seen from the graphic below.Pre-tax income by segmentSource: IBM Investor RelationsHardware has become decreasingly important to IBM, and today the company can easily absorb hardware weakness without significantly affecting the bottom line. While HP is in big trouble due to the shift to the cloud, IBM should be perfectly fine.What this means for IntelSales of x86 servers actually grew by 2.8% in the third quarter, as the big cloud companies design their servers around Intel chips. The vast increase in demand for servers from these companies is clearly a positive for Intel. However, the company has had to accept lower margins as the big cloud companies typically use cheaper, lower-margin CPUs than typical enterprise customers.This margin sacrifice is necessary in order to keep AMD and ARM-based chips from gaining any significant server market share. Intel's data center group is a bright spot for the company, and Intel expects revenue to grow by 15% annually in the long-term. This likely hinges on the company's chips powering the growing data centers of the big cloud companies, and Intel is making sure that happens. The CPU is one area that companies can't really skimp on, and Intel offers superior performance-per-watt compared to the alternatives.The bottom lineMuch like the PC market, the server market is becoming one where the companies that actually manufacture the servers make very little money, while Intel manages hefty margins. Given HP's reliance on server profits, I don't see a path to growth for the company any time soon. IBM's shift away from hardware is serving it well, and a declining hardware business means little for its bottom line. Intel has serious competitive advantages in the server chip business, and those should allow the company to continue to dominate the industry.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Microsoft Should Be Scared to Death of Google's Chromebooks,"Nov 28, 2013 at 12:00PM","In the 1990s, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) worked hard to undermine Java, Sun Microsystem's programming language. Back then, it was believed that Java would allow programmers to write applications that could effectively run on any operating system, whether it was Windows or anything else. Although it never really materialized, the promise of Java's ""write once, run anywhere"" design philosophy held the potential to destroy Microsoft's Windows operating system monopoly.Well, the threat is back, and this time, it's for real. Cloud computing and web-based applications are slowly eroding users' dependency on local applications, in effect, rendering Microsoft's Windows operating system completely irrelevant. Google's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) cheap Chromebooks could conquer the market for traditional PCs, as Microsoft's hardware partners like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) have begun to support Google aggressively.Microsoft shows its hand in new adMicrosoft's new ad has drawn a bit of attention in the tech media -- writers are puzzled by Microsoft's assault on Google's Chromebooks. Business Insider's Jay Yarrow writes:But, the weird thing about this ad is that it's aimed at the Chromebook, which seems like a nothing business so far. Microsoft actually has to explain Chromebooks in the ad since most people don't know what they are.That's true -- Google's Chromebooks remain a paltry percentage of the overall PC market today. However, Microsoft's desire to undermine them is justified -- the Chromebook's potential is practically limitless. Although they remain hobbled by their inability to run local software, Google's Chromebooks are incredibly cheap, boot almost instantly, and are more or less impervious to traditional viruses.Chromebooks are becoming more capable every dayMoreover, the limitations of Chromebooks are being diminished every day. Google's Chromebooks can't run any local software, but nearly anything cloud-based runs just fine. As more software developers offer cloud-based versions of their applications, Chromebooks are becoming ever more capable.Chromebooks can even run AutoCAD, traditionally known as one of the most demanding pieces of software, because AutoDesk has begun to offer a cloud version. Although Microsoft claims that a Chromebook can't run Office, that's not really true -- owners of Google's Chromebooks can use Office WebApps, a slightly dumbed-down version of Microsoft's full Office software suite.When Asus announced its Chromebook earlier this year, the company's CEO said that, while he didn't believe Google's laptops would ever catch on among consumers, he thought they had a bright future among businesses, governments, and schools.That makes sense -- business software, like Salesforce's applications, are increasingly being offered in cloud form. Further, enterprise users can set up virtual desktop servers, streaming local applications to a fleet of cheap Chromebooks.Microsoft has alienated its hardware partnersAsus isn't the only company to support Google's Chromebooks -- HP has also begun to shift its support toward Google. Earlier this year, HP's CEO Meg Whitman identified Microsoft as a ""competitor."" For years, Microsoft and HP had been the closest of allies, but with Microsoft taking the unprecedented step of offering its own tablets and PCs, HP feels threatened.Every time Microsoft sells a Surface Pro, that's potentially a lost sale for HP. And when HP does sell a Windows device, it has to pay Microsoft money for the privilege. That said, HP still sells mostly Windows machines, and likely will for many quarters to come.But so far this year, HP has rolled out three new Chromebooks, and I wouldn't be surprised if more are in the works. As Microsoft pushes its ""devices and services"" strategy, HP becomes ever more incentivized to offer alternatives to Windows.Will Windows survive?Perhaps the most ironic thing about the rise of the Chromebook is that Microsoft is slowly transforming Windows into a copy of Chrome OS. Windows 8.1, Microsoft's recent update to the Windows operating system, merges Microsoft's online services -- SkyDrive and Bing -- with Microsoft's local operating system.Windows PCs can still run local software, but with Windows 8.1, they're more connected than ever before. In the way that Chromebook users store their files on Google and become reliant on Google search, SkyDrive integration means that more local files are being stored on Microsoft's servers, while Bing search becomes integrated into the overall experience of using a Windows PC.Microsoft's Windows has tons of inertia behind it, and it certainly isn't going to go away anytime soon. Yet, although Google's Chromebooks remain just a tiny part of the larger PC market for the time being, unlike the broader PC market, the demand for Chromebooks is actually growing.With the support of Microsoft's spurned hardware partners like HP and the growth of cloud computing, Google's Chromebooks are a very real threat to Windows and shouldn't be taken lightly.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2 Reasons Dell Is the Riskiest Stock in the Market Today,"Jul 6, 2013 at 11:00AM","Shares of Dell (UNKNOWN:DELL.DL) fell as low as $12.71 on Friday, even as founder Michael Dell's proposal to buy the company for $13.65 goes before shareholders two weeks from now. At first glance, Dell might seem like a no-brainer ""buy"" candidate (invest $12.71 now, get $13.65 after the proxy vote on July 18).However, this is far from being the whole story. An activist campaign led by Carl Icahn's Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP) investment fund has made Dell perhaps the riskiest stock in the market. Icahn believes that Michael Dell's proposal to buy the company significantly undervalues Dell. Yet while Icahn probably has the heft (and the votes) to scuttle Dell's go-private deal, he is unlikely to garner enough support to implement his proposal to increase shareholder value through a $14 tender offer.The results are likely to be very disappointing for Dell shareholders. If this ""clash of the titans"" between Dell and Icahn ends in a stalemate, the company will find itself without a clear strategic direction and its valuation could revert to a much lower multiple, in keeping with Dell's uncertain prospects.1. Dell-Silver Lake buyout on the rocksInvestors can debate whether the $13.65 buyout offer from Michael Dell and hedge fund Silver Lake Partners recognizes the ""full"" value of Dell. However, one thing cannot be disputed: Until Michael Dell and Silver Lake came along with a proposal to take the company private, Dell stock was worth much less, bottoming below $9 in late 2012.DELL 1 YEAR PRICE CHART, DATA BY YCHARTSThe rapid rise in Dell's stock price in early 2013 was a direct result of the buyout offer. Indeed, as Dell's ""Special Committee"" pointed out in a shareholder presentation released Friday, the PC industry outlook has been revised lower numerous times in the past year. Company fundamentals have also suffered, lagging those of competitors like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ).This hasn't stopped Icahn from making the rounds on TV to tell anybody who will listen that Dell is worth far more than $13.65. Yet as the Wall Street Journal recently noted, Icahn has not offered to buy the company at any price; he wants Dell to fund a $14 tender offer with the company's cash on hand and new debt.In late 2012, when Dell shares were mired below $10, most shareholders would have taken $13.65 in a heartbeat. Icahn's muckraking has clouded the waters; many shareholders now seem unwilling to sell at that price. Indeed, the Special Committee of Dell's board recently advised Michael Dell and Silver Lake to raise their bid in order to improve their chances of winning the upcoming shareholder vote. However, according to a Bloomberg report on Friday, Dell and Silver Lake will not budge.2. Icahn's tender offer: a long shotShareholders voting against the Dell-Silver Lake buyout offer are probably doing so because they have been convinced that Icahn's tender offer plan would offer more value. However, investors need to understand that even if the Dell-Silver Lake buyout is rejected, Icahn's plan has a very low probability of being implemented.The problem is that Michael Dell owns approximately 16% of the company. While he has to remain ""neutral"" in the buyout vote, he can vote as he pleases if the buyout offer fails. This means that while Icahn only needs to muster 42% of the shareholder vote to scuttle the buyout offer, he needs a full 50% to elect his slate of directors and proceed with his recapitalization plan.According to AllThingsD, there is a good chance that the buyout will fail but Icahn will also fail to gain control of the company, leaving the company in no-man's-land. It has been very clear from the recent verbal sparring in the press that Icahn and Michael Dell have very different ideas about how to turn the company around. If the two sides are forced to share control of the company, prolonged bickering seems more likely than concerted action.Foolish bottom lineIf the ""deadlock"" scenario emerges, where neither Michael Dell nor Carl Icahn can take full control of the company, Dell stock could plummet. Dell's special committee noted in its recent presentation that if Dell were to trade for the same earnings multiple as HP, shares would be worth just $5.85-$8.67 across a range of plausible scenarios.Dell shares are trading at a significant discount to Michael Dell's buyout offer ($13.65) and Carl Icahn's proposed tender offer ($14) for good reason. Shareholders are so closely divided that it is very possible that both proposals will fail. Even if you are willing to sell your Dell stock for $13.65 and Michael Dell wants to buy your stock for $13.65, you'll only be able to sell at that price if enough other shareholders are of the same mind.While virtually every shareholder favors either Dell's plan or Icahn's plan over the status-quo, the two sides may be reaching a deadlock that keeps the status-quo intact by default. Ordinary shareholders are just pawns in this high-stakes game. The growing likelihood of stalemate makes Dell an incredibly risky stock for investors -- one that should probably be avoided.10 stocks we like better than DellWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

A Massive Hedge Fund Gradually Shifts Its Largest Bet,"Dec 16, 2013 at 6:47PM","Bridgewater Associates, the hedge fund founded by Ray Dalio, has a fascinating composition. It mixes concentrated investments in macroeconomic categories (usually through large, liquid ETFs) with a plethora of smaller positions. The fund's equity holdings disclosed on Sept. 30, 2013, stood at $11.8 billion. Three holdings made up 89% of the fund: the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:SPY), the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEMKT:VWO), and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEMKT:EEM). The last 11%, or $1.3 billion of holdings, was split among no fewer than 308 positions. Out of these positions, 241 represented less than 0.1% each of the total. The smallest position was a $95,000 stake in Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN). Now, to you and me, $95,000 may seem like a decent bit of coin. But in relation to $11.8 billion, it's infinitesimally small -- expressed as a percentage, it's 0.0008% of the total. To put this in perspective, picture a boulder that weighs one ton -- 2,000 pounds. Now take a slice of bread, tear off a fourth of that slice, and place that fourth on top of the boulder: This is the equivalent relationship in weight between the value of the Huntington Bancshares position and Bridgewater Associates' total publicly disclosed equity portfolio.Perusing the holdings of such a massive fund is endlessly fascinating, but it also illuminates some of the futility of trying to understand a particular hedge fund's decisions from a quarter-end disclosure that lists only positions held. Nonetheless, let's see if we can glean some insight from the latest filing.A significant concentration slowly shiftsBridewater Associates' investment in three huge ETFs has gradually evolved as the U.S. economy has improved. If we go back a little less than two years ago to 2011, we see that the fund held a huge bet on broad-based U.S. stocks through the SPY ETF, with a smaller position in emerging markets through the Vanguard and iShares ETFs:SOURCE: BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES SEC 13F FILINGSOver the last two years, the U.S. markets have outperformed emerging markets, as evidenced by the SPDR S&P 500's relative outperformance versus the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF:SPY DATA BY YCHARTS.As the U.S. markets continue to gain traction, it appears Bridgewater is taking profits along the way and reallocating the proceeds to emerging markets, effectively flipping the trade on its head. Here's what the composition looks like today:SOURCE: BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES SEC 13F FILINGSThe fund still has deep exposure to U.S. equities but may be anticipating a general investor rotation into emerging markets as the global economy improves and investors regain their risk appetite.Other noteworthy actions: goodbye to BenIn other developments, the fund closed out its position in Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN), the global investment manager better known as Franklin Templeton Investments. At 0.16%, this was one of the fund's more prominent holdings. Don't be surprised if you see this company show up in a future filing; it appears to be a favored trading position. Over the last three years, the fund has disclosed positions as small as $367,000 and as large as the $18.3 million stake it held on June 30, 2013. Franklin Resources has basically replicated the year-to-date return of the S&P 500 index but with a little more volatility, which may explain why it appears to be a frequent trade rather than a held position:BEN DATA BY YCHARTS.An anchor and a tech turnaroundAt 0.1% of total portfolio value, General Electric (NYSE:GE) is one of the larger holdings filed in this quarter outside of the ""big three"" ETFs. GE joins about 22 other stocks with a weighting of at least one-tenth of a percent, which encompasses a broad representation of U.S. tech, industrial, and retail giants, including Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), American Express (NYSE:AMX), and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). Positions like these likely provide a counterweight to the fund's overall concentration in emerging markets.GE has posted similar numbers so far in 2013 compared with 2012. Through the first three quarters of reported earnings, total revenue decreased 1.7% from the prior year, operating income was nearly identical to 2012's at 9.7%, and net income, at 9.3% of sales, showed less than a 0.5% improvement. But as a representative S&P 500 stock with bright prospects in an improving U.S. economy, GE seems a credible choice as an anchor to the fund's non-ETF positions.Finally, the fund added struggling tech behemoth Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), valued at 0.15% of the total portfolio on Sept. 30, 2013. HP's declining revenue is a long-term concern as it seeks to compete in both the shrinking PC market and newer growth opportunities in the enterprise and cloud-computing markets. The company has been able to prop up quarterly earnings through cost-cutting during 2012 and 2013, and the investment community has viewed this action more or less favorably, as HP's stock is up nearly 90% this year. HP will be an interesting holding to review on Bridgewater Associates' next 13F filing. Additional shares may indicate that the fund expects revenue growth to follow the operations optimization, while a static position or trimming may indicate that the fund is merely looking for a quarter or two of further momentum in the stock."
How IBM Created the Future of the PC -- and Almost Destroyed Its Own,"Aug 12, 2013 at 11:33AM","On this day in economic and business history...International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) burst into the growing personal computer field Wednesday by announcing a new system that will be sold through IBM's own stores, ComputerLand dealers, and Sears, Roebuck & Co's new Business System Centers.The IBM personal computer, designed for home, school, or small business use, will range in price from $1,565 for a basic home system attached to an audio cassette player and television system to as much as $6,300 for business systems using color graphics and printers.With its announcement, made with great fanfare at media conferences held simultaneously in Chicago and other cities, IBM presented its challenge to Apple Computer; Tandy's Radio Shack; and Commodore International. Those firms now dominate the personal computer market, which has grown to $1.5 billion in revenues since the mid-1970s.-- Chicago Tribune, ""Personal computers to join IBM lineup."" Aug. 13, 1981.IBM changed the world on Aug. 12, 1981, when it launched the 5150 personal computer. It was not the first to market -- Apple, RadioShack, and Commodore had created the first ""trinity"" of true PCs in 1977 (click the links to read more about their groundbreaking products) -- but IBM blew the doors off the competition, purely by accident. In fact, it was because IBM acted in a most un-IBM-like way that its PC became the de facto computing standard for more than three decades.The personal-computing market was already growing rapidly by 1981. Contemporary estimates showed the size of that market doubling every year since the launch of the 1977 trinity, and by the time IBM was ready to hit the market, approximately 80,000 computers were shipped each month, resulting in monthly revenue of about $250 million. Every month that IBM waited would see it fall further behind in an exploding market.The company could have developed proprietary components and built its PC from the ground up, as its competitors had, but that might have taken years. When IBM executives reached out to Bill Lowe, the director of IBM's General Systems Division lab in Boca Raton, Fla., to develop a personal computer, they granted him and his team wide latitude for the sake of development speed. As a result, the Boca Raton team did something IBM had never done before in developing a new system: They used other companies' parts. IBM's history describes this fast-paced environment:The manufacturing strategy was to simplify everything, devise a sound plan and not deviate. There was not time to develop and test all components. So they shopped for completely functioning and pretested subassemblies, put them together and tested the final product. Zero defects was part of the plan.In sum, the development team broke all the rules. They went outside the traditional boundaries of product development within IBM. They went to outside vendors for most of the parts, went to outside software developers for the operating system and application software, and acted as an independent business unit. Those tactics enabled them to develop and announce the IBM PC in 12 months -- at that time faster than any other hardware product in IBM's history.At a press conference at the Waldorf Astoria ballroom in New York City, [PC project lead Don] Estridge announced the IBM Personal Computer with a price tag of $1,565. Two decades earlier, an IBM computer often cost as much as $9 million and required an air-conditioned quarter-acre of space and a staff of 60 people to keep it fully loaded with instructions. The new IBM PC could not only process information faster than those earlier machines but it could hook up to the home TV set, play games, process text and harbor more words than a fat cookbook.IBM sold 100,000 5150 PCs by Christmas of 1981. It did not immediately become the best-selling machine on the market -- the Commodore 64 held that title until IBM-based PCs took the lead in 1985 -- but it set in motion a sea change in the computing industry that would eventually push two of the 5150's component suppliers to all-time market-cap records. Because the IBM PC's core components were supplied by other companies, all it took was a ""clean room"" reverse engineering of the IBM PC's basic input/output system for other manufacturers to figure out how to build copycat machines without running afoul of any IBM copyrights.Columbia Data Products launched first IBM PC clone less than one year later after taking the 5150 through the clean-room reverse-engineering process. This clone retained the two most important parts of the original 5150: the Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) 8088 microprocessor and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) MS-DOS operating system. Wintel was thus allowed to spread beyond IBM's control, and before long there were a wide array of IBM-compatible PCs on the market. The first ""portable"" IBM PC, the Compaq Portable, launched shortly after Columbia's clone, and by the mid-'80s, Compaq and other low-cost manufacturers had begun to push the PC standard forward with the use of better Intel chips and more advanced Microsoft operating systems.By the late 1980s, IBM had effectively lost control of the technical standard it had created. Its effort to build a proprietary operating system (with Microsoft's help) fell flat, and Windows took off shortly thereafter. The spread of commoditized PCs was an incredible boon to Intel and Microsoft, as both companies retained full control over the pricing of the PC's two most essential components. However, IBM was floundering. The venerable tech company reported a $5 billion annual loss for the 1992 fiscal year, a record for U.S. corporations, despite holding the lead in global PC market share. PCs had become a commodity, and IBM couldn't keep cutting its prices.The decision to use off-the-shelf components had far-reaching effects on the business world. PCs would almost certainly have continued to spread without IBM, but the computers that would have spread in the 5150's absence would have looked and worked differently. Instead of establishing IBM at the head of the computing pack, the PC eventually produced market caps in excess of $500 billion for both Microsoft and Intel, while IBM sought buyers for its distressed PC manufacturing operations. After IBM lost the market-share lead in the 1990s, Hewlett-Packard eventually stepped up in its stead, particularly after it merged with PC clone pioneer Compaq in 2002.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) recognized Microsoft and Intel's importance to the PC era in 1999, two years after it added HP to its roster. No other easily identifiable product can claim as much responsibility for the success of so many Dow components as the IBM 5150. Unfortunately, these companies' continued reliance on the PC industry in a post-PC era might make them the PC's next wave of victims, as well.10 better buys than the Dow Jones Industrial AverageWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons Dell Went Private,"Nov 1, 2013 at 8:35AM","Last month, Michael Dell tweeted a message that resounds globally:""Welcome to the world's largest start-up!""After an exhaustive, lengthy process of trying to take Dell private, Mr. Dell's mind is at ease. The deal is complete.But now, his mind is again racing, just in another fashion — moving from ideation to implementation. Let's look at three reasons that going private was a good move for the company.Reason 1: A platform for transformationArmed with $1,000 in his college dorm room, Mr. Dell founded Dell in 1984. Just 15 years later, the company boasted the top spot for the following three segments: PCs in the world for large and medium businesses, PCs in America, and worldwide workstation shipments. Two years later, it became the number one PC system manufacturer on earth.Now, nearly 15 years since these first accolades, Dell once again is expanding on repositioning efforts. If history is any indicator, we may see some top spots in coming years.And if Mr. Dell's leadership record is not enough, consider the company's strengths, including customer loyalty. Dell didn't lose a single large customer during the choppy waters of the past year. In fact, some of its large clients drafted contingency plans in case Mr. Dell would no longer be the CEO.Further, Dell boasts more than 140,000 channel partners, which generates about 35% of the firm's commercial revenue; seven years ago, no revenue came through these channels. Additionally, Dell continues to grow its $21 billion enterprise business, which is already up 110% in 5 years, an average of 22% annual growth. The target: $40 billion.Imagine the progress that can be made when Mr. Dell holds the reins and is only responsible to the primary shareholder, himself.Reason 2: Less paperwork, more productive workAs a private enterprise and unlike its primary competitors, Dell is not required to meet shareholder or analyst expectations. Plus, the company can forego quarterly or annual filings with the SEC, expensive IR associated costs, and dividend and buyback measures, among other processes involved with being a public company.Assuming Dell spent the same amount on dividends and buybacks as it has the past 5 years, this cash flow would exceed the monthly interest payments to the banks that lent cash to Dell for the buyout. That equation is pretty good, especially considering the potential future dividend increases had it stayed public and the extra cash it will have to invest or pay down additional debt.So, with less distractions and more control, Mr. Dell is now building on his vision.Reason 3: 'Cash Flow' and 'Growth'The first two reasons fuel the third: Mr. Dell's vision to transform his company into a global powerhouse that emphasizes customer needs and a long-term time horizon. How? Grow fast and generate cash.One way Dell expects to achieve this goal is by targeting mid-size companies, the fastest growing portion of the vast $3 trillion IT business. So, let's run some numbers. According to Mr. Dell, Dell owns 2% of the market and no competitor owns more than 5%. If Dell can capture just an extra .25% growth within the fastest growing segment of the market, it will generate $7.5 billion — not bad.Additionally, Mr. Dell will invest more heavily in R&D, something shareholders seemed to dislike, while building out the company's customer base. Mr. Dell even plans to sell PCs as a loss leader, considering 90% of its PC users buy extra services or products.As a result, competitors like Hewlett-Packard, which are still under the watchful public eye and are subject to quarterly reports, may be in for a harsh awakening.His final, forward thoughtsAs Mr. Dell said:We still have a long way to go and many challenges to meet.... But under a new private company structure we will have the flexibility to accelerate our strategy and pursue organic and inorganic investment without the scrutiny, quarterly targets and other limitations of operating as a public company. Our 110,000 team members worldwide are 100 percent focused on our customers and aggressively executing our long-term strategy for their benefit.Time will tell if Dell's historical indicators will prove correct. Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Together, they've tripled the stock market's return over the last 13 years.* And while timing isn't everything, the history of Tom and David's stock picks shows that it pays to get in early on their ideas.Click here to be among the first people to hear about David and Tom's newest stock recommendations.*Stock Advisor returns as of April 2, 2018"
Don't Sweat Polycom Losing Cisco,"Oct 18, 2013 at 7:00PM","Maybe we should've seen this coming. There's been a brain drain lately at Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) as networking companies have been picking top people off from the C-suite of the unified communications specialist.Last week Brocade Communications announced it had hired away Polycom's chief information officer, while on the same day Riverbed Technology said it plucked its chief marketing officer. Of course, in July, Polycom's CEO resigned under a cloud after an internal audit found irregularities in his expense account.Now an analyst at William Blair says its chief rival, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), is ending its relationship with the audio- and video-conferencing equipment maker, a move that could cost it some $50 million in revenue annually and swipe $0.08 per share from its earnings.The videoconferencing market has gotten more competitive even as it has undergone consolidation. Cisco bought Tandberg in 2010 for $3 billion, Logitech purchased LifeSize for $408 million, Microsoft spent $8.5 billion to acquire Skype, Polycom bought Hewlett-Packard's visual collaboration division, and Avaya bought Radvision, all with expectations that the expansion the industry was enjoying would continue.But 2012 upset the apple cart, with broad declines across the board, though analysts thought it was an aberration and videoconferencing would rebound this year. That apparently hasn't worked out according to plan -- the first quarter of 2013 got off to a rocky start, with Cisco witnessing a 17% decline in revenue and Polycom suffering an 11% drop from the year ago period (and down 12% sequentially). It didn't get much better in the second quarter, either, as the equipment market dropped another 10.7% from 2012's level and 5.5% from the first quarter.In retrospect, 2011 was a watershed year for the industry, and worldwide revenues have since plunged by 34%. So when we see the struggles Polycom is going through, it's no surprise management is jumping ship for calmer waters and Cisco wants to drive a stake through the heart of its biggest rival.Cisco was already weaning itself away from Polycom, as it announced earlier this year it was moving to another vendor for IP conference phones, so this analyst note really might not be the big revelation it otherwise seems, and could explain why Polycom's stock has barely reacted.As the unified communications specialist moves to more software-based platforms, such hardware-oriented news might be even less damaging. While the whole industry has been down and its executive suite has suffered a bit of turmoil, Polycom has largely held onto its market position.At around 16 times expected earnings -- admittedly, earnings that don't take into account the William Blair analyst's expectations of an $0.08 per share hit -- Polycom is parked in between Cisco and Logitech at either extreme, but it doesn't seem to me it will remain at that level for much longer."
Why I'm Doubling Down on Apple Stock,"Jul 10, 2013 at 6:30PM","As shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) dropped from more than $700 to less than $400 between September 2012 and April 2013, investors' concerns about the company multiplied rapidly. From a psychological perspective, this is not very surprising. While Apple stock was running up from less than $400 in late 2011 to its peak around $700, it was natural for investors (including me) to gloss over some of the company's weaknesses.APPLE STOCK PRICE CHART, DEC. 2011-PRESENT. DATA BY YCHARTS.By contrast, during its recent fall, Apple's flaws have come into clearer focus, and many people seem to have forgotten that it is still one of the most profitable companies in the world. A recent article in Fortune tried to take an even-handed approach, but still concluded that Apple has peaked. Author Adam Lashinsky argues that the company is ""following"" competitors with its new products and services like iTunes Radio, iOS 7 and possibly an iWatch.In the midst of this chaos, an incredibly simple fact often gets overlooked: Even if investors were overly optimistic about Apple's prospects when they drove the Apple stock price up above $700 in September, isn't it very likely that the company is dramatically undervalued in the low-$400 range? That's what I concluded, which is why I significantly increased my position in Apple late last month.Has Apple really peaked?The debate about whether Apple has ""peaked"" makes for some very interesting theater, but can sometimes obscure more than it reveals, especially from an investing standpoint. There are two key points that investors should keep in mind when considering the future prospects of Apple and its stock.The first point to consider is that it takes a good deal of hubris for analysts and other bystanders to proclaim that innovation is dead at Apple. While investors have become accustomed to the idea that leaks in the supply chain will give plenty of advance warning regarding Apple's plans, outsiders cannot really be sure of what the company is working on.At most, one could argue that Apple has not debuted any innovative products since Steve Jobs died. However, there was a gap of more than five years between the iPod's debut in late 2001 and the announcement of the iPhone in early 2007. During that time, the company created lots of variations on the iPod (and iMac), but nothing truly ""new.""Somebody who thought in 2005 that Apple had stopped innovating was proven wrong in dramatic fashion. However, the idea that Apple had peaked would never have even come up in 2005, simply because Apple stock traded for less than $40 back then. Apple just wasn't a big deal in 2005, whereas today it is constantly under the microscope.A second point to consider is what people really mean when they speculate about whether Apple has peaked. If people are measuring the distance between Apple and competitors, then it is probably true that Apple has peaked. Apple was so far ahead of competitors in the smartphone and tablet arenas -- two humongous addressable markets -- by mid-late 2010 that it would be hard to replicate that dominance. For example, Apple had a staggering 71% share of smartphone profits in 2011.However, if the question is whether Apple's earnings power has peaked -- and this is the key question if you're thinking about whether or not to buy Apple stock -- the answer is ""probably not."" Indeed, despite all of the pessimism surrounding Apple today, analysts still (on average) expect the company to grow revenue by more than 9% and EPS by more than 10% next year. That would still leave Apple's EPS a little below the record high it achieved in 2012, but any new product lines (or even higher-than-expected share repurchases) could lead to record EPS next year.The big takeaway is that even if Apple never reopens its lead in the smartphone or tablet markets, and even if it never creates a new product that takes the world by storm, there is still room for the company to resume earnings growth by fully exploiting existing opportunities. One example is the often rumored idea of building a lower-cost iPhone that could be affordable to the middle class in developing countries.Beyond a bargainWhen I stated in the introduction that Apple stock's rapid decline from $700 to less than $400 seemed overdone, that actually underestimated the depth of the company's fall. From an enterprise value standpoint -- which adjusts for debt and excess cash to determine the value of the underlying business -- the drop in Apple's value was much steeper. After deducting Apple's cash, the company's enterprise value peaked at nearly $550 billion last September. As recently as late June, that had fallen nearly 60% to $225 billion.Moreover, Apple has announced a big increase to its share repurchase program in the interim, raising confidence that excess cash will gradually be returned to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. That means that investors have less reason to discount or ignore the company's cash when determining Apple stock's proper value.Could the Apple enterprise really be worth just $225 billion? Analysts currently expect Apple to earn over $37 billion for FY13, compared to last year's record earnings of $41.7 billion. Apple's enterprise valuation therefore bottomed at just six times earnings last month, and still sits well below seven times earnings. That represents a discount to the valuation of Hewlett-Packard, a company that has gone through much more turmoil over the last two years, and it represents a significant discount to Dell's current valuation.In short, the recent Apple stock price only makes sense if you believe that the company's earnings will continue declining. However, it's important to note that while earnings declined this year, revenue growth continued. The earnings decline was entirely driven by lower gross margin. The bulk of the evidence points to this margin contraction being one-time in nature, not a long-term trend.Foolish conclusionIf you believe that bargains do arise in the stock market, Apple stock today fits the bill. The company may not be as far ahead of competitors as it was two or three years ago, but it still has a unique brand name that provides an enviable moat. Moreover, despite a margin ""correction,"" the company is still on pace to earn net income of approximately $37 billion this year.Yet for all these advantages, Apple stock can be bought for less than seven times earnings (if you exclude the company's cash). Could something go wrong for Apple investors? It's always possible; the technology landscape can change rapidly. However, Apple provides a generous margin of safety for value investors -- enough to make me feel comfortable upping my holdings.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Will Smart Pills Revolutionize Health Care?,"Sep 11, 2013 at 4:40PM","The ongoing convergence of the tech and health care industries has yielded some remarkable advances in telehealth, electronic health records, or EHRs, and mobile apps. Yet several companies are going even further by creating ""smart pills"" -- medications that are synchronized to mobile devices after they are ingested.This idea of edible technology has crossed over from sci-fi to reality to address the troubling fact that over half of all drugs worldwide are prescribed, dispensed, or sold inappropriately, according to the World Health Organization.The smart pillLast July, the Food and Drug Administration approved Proteus Digital Health's ingestible biosensor and its companion patch as the world's first ""smart pill"" system, Helius. The pill is embedded with a tiny sensor made from silicon and natural ingredients.After the pill is swallowed, it uses stomach fluid as a power source to broadcast signals back to its battery-powered companion patch. The data includes vital information such as the time of ingestion, the patient's heart rate, body temperature, and other activities. That data is then sent to a smartphone app used by physicians to better gauge a patient's current condition.SOURCE: MOBIHEALTHNEWS.COMPrior to FDA approval, Helius was tested for the treatment of mental health, heart conditions, hypertension, and diabetes, according to Proteus CEO Andrew Thompson.A trio of major backersProteus Digital Health has some major investors, including pharma giant Novartis (NYSE:NVS), medical device bellwether Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), and tech giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).In 2010, Novartis invested $24 million in Proteus to license its sensor technology worldwide. Novartis also gained rights related to Proteus' upcoming oncology, cardiovascular, and clinical development applications for the smart pill system. Novartis has used the smart pill technology on a 20-patient study to track the use of its blood pressure drug, Diovan. According to Novartis, the use of Proteus' technology improved drug regimen compliance from 30% to 80% after six months. This higher compliance rate could not only increase the quality of care for patients, but also boost Novartis' revenue through higher sales of its drugs.Medtronic's interest in Proteus also suggests a strong link between smart pills and telehealth devices. Medtronic currently produces pacemakers that can be monitored remotely via its CareLink Network. It also recently acquired remote monitoring device company Cardiocom to expand its telehealth business. For Medtronic, investing in smart pills and remote monitoring solutions is a sound way to diversify from its core business of medical devices, which may suffer from upcoming Medicare cuts.In May, Oracle made a minority investment in Proteus. The two companies plan to work together in clinical trials to provide clinical investigators with data regarding the efficacy of its smart pill technology. Proteus' technology will also be integrated into Oracle's health care IT segment, which has a wide array of services based in its Oracle Health Services Cloud. Boosting the strength of its health care portfolio could help boost Oracle's presence in the health care IT industry, where it competes with other IT giants like Hewlett-Packard and IBM.The evolution of camera pillsJust as the smartphone was an evolutionary step up from the digital camera, smart pills represent the evolution of capsule endoscopy -- those tiny camera pills that were approved by the FDA more than a decade ago. Camera pills are generally used to record videos for gastrointestinal treatments, but they lack Proteus' sophisticated sensors.Given Imaging (UNKNOWN:GIVN.DL), a major manufacturer of camera pills, recognized this market shift and acquired SmartPill Corporation's Smart Pill GI Monitoring System last October for $6 million. The SmartPill uses sensors to measure pH levels, pressure, and temperature in the gastrointestinal tract. It can also measure total gastrointestinal transit times to better evaluate disorders like gastroparesis and constipation.Demand for Given Imaging's pill technologies is rising; last quarter, the company reported that earnings and revenue rose 70.7% and 11.1%, respectively, from the prior-year quarter. Shares are up more than 30% over the past 12 months.A Foolish final thoughtSmart pills represent a major point of convergence for the tech and health care industries. These camera pills that have evolved into full-featured medical sensors could significantly improve patient adherence to medications and better measure the effects of those medications in real time.With companies like Novartis, Medtronic, and Oracle supporting this technology, smart pills could soon join telehealth, EHRs, and mobile apps as the next big thing in the booming health care IT industry.Editor's note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Given Imaging acquired the SmartPill GI Monitoring System for $6 billion. The Fool regrets the error."
Should You Buy Intel Stock Today?,"Jul 10, 2013 at 2:03PM","Shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shrugged off a weak first quarter of 2013 to rally in the second quarter. By mid-June, Intel stock was trading 24.8% higher year to date, soundly beating the Dow Jnes Industrial Average's (DJINDICES:^DJI) 16.9% gain. But the high didn't last long. Intel came back to Earth over the last week, and now it trails its Dow peers for 2013. The chip giant reports earnings next Wednesday. Is this the right time to buy Intel stock -- or to back away slowly?INTC TOTAL RETURN PRICE DATA BY YCHARTS.Let's see. The price plunge over the last few days owes to renewed fears regarding the death of the PC. Not one, but three analyst firms downgraded Intel this week, sending the stock 4% lower overnight. They all questioned Intel's ability to keep margins stable in the swiftly changing market, where the company has missed the boat on tablet and smartphone sales.Here's where it gets a little weird. The just-released Haswell chip is seen as such a strong bet on mobile markets that this week's skeptics see it cannibalizing higher-margin desktop and server products. Damned if you do and damned if you don't, right? According to this logic, Intel shouldn't try to adapt to new markets, because the old ones are just too comfortably profitable.Well, the litmus test is about to begin. The new Haswell chips are available today, and they've been chosen to power a handful of brand-name tablets. Dell (UNKNOWN:DELL.DL) has a $1,200 tablet available with Haswell inside. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) announced Haswell-powered tablets last month. The Dell model runs Windows 8 and doubles as an ultrabook by swinging the screen around. We're still waiting for details on the HP slates, but they're likely to follow Dell into the Windows world.Intel chips do support the Android operating system, which is more of a proven quantity in the tablet world than anything Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has produced, but Windows remains the easiest way to combine tablet and laptop functions.These tablets may not be game-changers, but they are solid entries into the tablet market by a collection of companies desperate for some success. Dell and HP have tried their hands at tablets and phones before, with disastrous results. Microsoft has been selling smartphone software since before the iPhone boom, but it never broke through to mainstream success. And, as we have already established, Intel sure could use some mobility muscle to make up for dwindling PC sales.The important thing to notice here is that Intel is finally making the push into mobile computing. The market has matured, some say that smartphone sales have peaked already, and Intel is not making a play for massive growth in an exploding industry anymore. Instead, the company must aim for growing market share in a commoditized market. That sounds a lot like the PC and server markets where Intel has been making hay for decades.Let me leave you with one more chart. The panic over slow PC sales might lead you to believe that Intel's business is falling through the floor. The reality is nowhere near a drastic plunge, though. Let's see if these stable trends can continue in next week's earnings report. My personal Intel shares are betting that they can.INTC REVENUE TTM DATA BY YCHARTS."
"How Does Wal-Mart Look Compared to Target, Costco and Best Buy?","Nov 13, 2013 at 8:05PM","Thursday will likely be a big day for Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), the world's largest retailer with a market capitalization of more than $255.3 billion and 2012 sales of roughly $469.2 billion, as it reports its earnings for the third quarter of 2013. In comparison, Target (NYSE:TGT), one of Wal-Mart's biggest competitors, has a market capitalization of $41.3 billion and 2012 sales of $73.3 billion, while Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) sits in the middle with a market capitalization of $53.5 billion and 2012 revenue of almost $105.2 billion. All three retailers will be watched closely going into the holiday season by investors for indications of how the last quarter of the year will treat these mega-retailers. Tomorrow might just be the most important day of them all. Earnings expectationsFor the quarter, the consensus between analysts is that Wal-Mart will post earnings per share of $1.13 on revenue of $116.79 billion. If this expectation comes to fruition, then it would market a 4.6% increase in the company's earnings per share of $1.08 from the same quarter a year ago. Furthermore, it would imply that revenue for the industry behemoth has risen by 2.5% from the $113.93 billion the company reported this time last year.On a year-over-year basis, matching earnings would imply that the company has seen its nine-month earnings per share rise by 4.8% from $3.35 in the first three quarters of last year to $3.51 this year. This would imply revenue of $347.9 billion, a 2% increase from the $341.2 billion it clocked in during the same period last year. If this quarter is anything like last quarter, the disparity between earnings per share will likely be attributable to a small improvement in the company's cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue, combined with few common shares outstanding.How does Wal-Mart stack up against its peers?While analyzing a company's performance year-to-date is nice, it is more important to understand how the company has performed over an extended period of time, especially compared to its peers. In an attempt to assess this, I decided to pit the company up against Target and Costco.From a revenue perspective, Wal-Mart has performed in the middle of the pack. Over the past five years, the company saw its revenue rise by 16%. In comparison, Target was only capable of increasing its revenue by 12.9%. Although both of these growth rates are acceptable, they pale in comparison to the 47.2% growth rate experienced by Costco.Looking now toward net income, we see a similar, but slightly different story. While Costco saw its net income rise by an astonishing 87.8%, placing it in first place again, it was Target that earned second place with a growth rate of 35.5%. In contrast, Wal-Mart came in third place with a 26.9% improvement in its net income; still good but leaving investors to question if Target or, very possibly, Costco, might eventually knock Wal-Mart out of the number one spot eventually.A new threat appearsIn addition to competition coming in from Target and Costco, Wal-Mart is also being threatened by a company that no one would have guessed a few years ago. The culprit? None other than Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), an electronics retailer with a market capitalization of $15 billion.Shares for the specialty retailer are up 292.8% from their 52-week low as the company has successfully turned its once faltering business around to at least some degree. Although revenue for the company had continued to decline year-to-date, it has been able to return from losses to profitability once again due to its ability to control costs.Now, admittedly, the company is far smaller than Wal-Mart and its focus is in electronics while Wal-Mart focuses on... well... everything, but a new advertisement for the company recently released challenges the assertion that Wal-Mart is the true place to buy things on the cheap. In addition to cutting $200 off the purchase price of a variety of Hewlett-Packard laptops (and beating at least one model by a penny), it's giving significant discounts on Apple products, such as $1,099.99 for the regularly priced $1,299.99 MacBook Pro with retina display.What this means for Best Buy is that it will likely garner some significant traffic this holiday season, but this traffic will come at the cost of lower margins. The downside to this is lower profitability in the short-term, but it offers a higher chance for customers to become enchanted by the Best Buy name, which could help in the long run.Foolish takeawayUndoubtedly, Wal-Mart is the big fish in the retail industry. However, just because of this, we cannot assume that this will always hold true. Target is catching up in terms of profitability, whereas Costco has rapidly expanded and is beating the giant on both its top line and bottom line in terms of year over year growth. Furthermore, Best Buy, though still small, should serve as a warning that size isn't everything in retail and that, in time, a smaller retailer may have ample opportunity to catch up to and steal market power from, a company as big as Wal-Mart in at least one of its segments.As far as earnings go, I don't believe it's out of the question to expect big things from the power player that is Wal-Mart in the short term. But, investors should remain only cautiously optimistic in the company's future prospects, because it appears as though multiple competitors are beginning to close in.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Why You're Wrong About This So-Called 3-D Printing Stock,"Nov 6, 2013 at 6:25PM","There's good reason for investors' keen interest in the additive manufacturing -- aka 3-D printing -- space. This disruptive sector is projected to grow 20% to 30% annually for the next five years. But like many hot stock sectors, this one harbors a lot of misinformation. Let's put one fairly widely held false belief to rest: Proto Labs (NYSE:PRLB) is not a 3-D printing play..Proto Labs is a service provider which uses subtractive -- not additive -- manufacturing.to rapidly produce custom metal and plastic components for others. Subtractive manufacturing involves using machinery to whittle away at a sheet or hunk of material. The machinery can be modern and computerized -- as in Proto Labs' case -- or manual. Additive manufacturing (or ""3-D printing""), which companies such as 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) use, builds up a part layer by layer.Even Investors Business Daily, a well-respected publication, has called Proto Labs a 3-D printing company. Additionally, Structured Solutions and STOXX, leading providers of financial market indices, have both included Proto Labs in their 3-D printing industry indices, according to ETF Strategy. Why the confusion? It seems a fair number of people equate ""prototyping,"" especially rapid prototyping, to ""3-D printing."" So the company's name is likely part of the issue. Nonetheless, prototypes were made using subtractive manufacturing long before additive manufacturing entered the scene, and are currently produced using both methods. Additionally, Proto Labs has only been a public company since Feb. 2012, so lack of familiarity is surely at play. Proto Labs' niche is the quick-turnaround of smaller production runs, though it also produces prototypes. It uses computer numerical control, or CNC, machines to produce metal components and injection molders to churn out plastic ones. CNC machining is a subtractive manufacturing technology. Ironically, Proto Labs is using technology that 3-D printing is largely replacing. Though don't let that scare you from considering investing in promising subtractive manufacturing plays, as subtractive manufacturing isn't going to disappear, in my opinion. There are benefits and drawbacks to both types of manufacturing. Subtractive manufacturing will surely contract, as additive manufacturing expands. However, that should just shake out weaker companies.  Proto Labs subtracts, but its business and metrics add up Proto Labs is in a fragmented industry, largely comprised of smaller, private companies. While there might be a few public companies that have some overlapping operations, there are no comparable competitors. That's often a sign a company has a solid moat around its niche and will sport strong numbers. Since its IPO, Proto Labs' stock has given the hot 3-D printers' stocks a run for their money. It's been performing in-line with Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), the second largest 3-D printing company by market cap, and holding its own against the largest industry player 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). RevenueProto Labs' revenue growth is solid, though not as strong as that of the two major 3-D printers. However, as those following the 3-D printers know, 3D Systems has been gobbling up smaller companies at a frenetic pace.While it seems to be doing a decent job incorporating acquisitions into its fold, a growth-by-acquisitions strategy can present concerns. Proto Labs' revenue growth was in-line with Stratasys' until Stratasys' merger with Objet in late 2012.Proto Labs and 3D Systems recently reported third-quarter results, while Stratasys is slated to report on Nov. 7. That's the reason Stratasys' chart is one quarter short of the others.EarningsProto Labs' earnings-per-share growth has been stronger than its revenue growth, meaning margins have been expanding. This margin expansion has largely owed to the company's ability to quickly turn around jobs for customers. This competitive advantage provides it with pricing power. Meanwhile, the two 3-D printer companies have experienced negative earnings growth. Stratasys' profitability was negatively affected by the Objet merger, and the company is currently not profitable, on a GAAP basis. However, analysts expect it to return to profitability in 2014. 3D Systems' earnings growth has suffered due to its frequent small acquisitions. However, it's still solidly profitable, with a trailing-12-month profit margin of 9.5%.  ValuationProto Labs' strong growth, a pristine balance sheet (the company has close to no debt and a solid cash position), and fat margins (nearly 22% profit margin on a trailing-12-month basis) don't come cheap.The stock is valued at a forward P/E of 47.4 and a five-year price-to-earnings-to-growth, or PEG, of 1.9. While that may seem pricey, it's a bargain compared to the 3-D printer stocks. Granted, the 3-D printing sector has more growth potential; however, I think we could see some intense pricing competition on the consumer and, perhaps, professional end of the sector, which will likely result in margin contraction. It's easier for larger companies to enter these markets -- as Hewlett-Packard just did -- than it is for them to enter the industrial end of the 3-D printer market.Meanwhile, Proto Labs has solid barriers to entry, which extend beyond setup costs. The company is known to be extremely efficient, and a newer entrant would likely not be able to to match its quick-turnaround capabilities for quite some time.  A prototypically potent investment Remember to be somewhat skeptical of what you read when technically oriented stocks are involved, especially when they're in hot stock spaces.If your investing goal is to gain exposure to the 3-D printing space, you should ""subtract"" Proto Labs from your watch list. However, if your goal is to invest in a promising stock, regardless of industry classification, Proto Labs certainly deserves a look.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

A Look Back at Nike's Performance in 2013,"Dec 16, 2013 at 4:30PM","Nike (NYSE:NKE) has performed extremely well for shareholders this year, and although the company only joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) in September, it looks to end 2013 as one of the index's top-performing members. A share-price return of 48.64% year to date makes the athletic apparel maker the second-best Dow stock, behind only Boeing's 79.18% gain in 2013 and just ahead of American Express' 47.3% rise. The chart below shows how Nike compared to the Dow and S&P 500 since Jan. 1.NKE DATA BY YCHARTS.As you can see from the chart, Nike clobbered both the Dow and the S&P 500 this year. Nike's share price tracked the indexes fairly closely throughout the year. Similar peaks and valleys can be seen across the time frame, except for two big divergences; the first came in late March after Nike's performance had lagged the indexes for a few weeks, then in September Nike pulled away from the market's slow rise. So what happened at those times? Let's take a look.The first big jump came on March 22 after the company reported earnings. As my colleague Jeremy Bowman said at the time, Nike was playing above the rim that day -- shares rose more than 12% at one point during trading. The company reported earnings-per-share growth of 20%, revenue growth of 9% during the quarter, and a big gain after selling its Cole Haan brand for $203 million. Additionally, the company reported strong growth in North America and Europe, while China and other parts of Asia struggled. This was largely seen as good news because the U.S. is still Nike's largest market and primary source of profit.  The move in September can be contributed to two things. First, on Sept. 10, the Dow Jones announced that it had chosen Nike, Goldman Sachs, and Visa to replace Bank of America, Alcoa, and Hewlett-Packard among the index's 30 members. This announcement affected the stock price because it meant that some funds now had to buy Nike shares to meet their guidelines. For example, your average Dow Jones index fund is required to hold all 30 of the stocks on the index. Being added to the Dow instantly increased the demand for Nike shares and thus the stock price rose.  Nike also delivered a strong fiscal first quarter earnings release on Sept. 26, reporting that it increased revenue by 8% during the period and earnings per share by 54%. The results were a sign that the competition wasn't hurting business. The stock jumped 4.7% after the earnings announcement and moved above $70 per share, where it remains today.  Moving forwardLooking down the road, Nike can be expected to continue to perform well and produce strong returns for shareholders, but perhaps not as strong as what we saw in 2013. The move to the Dow was a big win for the company and shareholders, but that sort of thing doesn't happen every year.Over the past few years many have wondered what the likes of Under Armour and lululemon athletica may do to Nike and its growth. However, we have yet to see any meaningful market-share erosion from the competition into Nike's core business. I personally believe the athletic apparel industry has enough space for a number of different players. Nike is still clearly the top dog, which I expect to remain true for at least the next few years.More Foolishness10 better buys than the Dow Jones Industrial AverageWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

Learn to Invest Like FC Barcelona,"Oct 21, 2013 at 10:29AM","BARCELONA (IN UNICEF SHIRTS) CLASHING WITH ARCH-RIVALS REAL MADRID, 2009. SOURCE WIKIMEDIA COMMONSLast month, an incredible streak was broken in international sports. In a soccer match against Spanish League adversary Rayo Vallecano, Futbol Club Barcelona walked off the field with fewer minutes of ball possession than their opponent for the first time in 136 games. The game (which Barcelona won 4-0 nonetheless) marked the first time in three years in which Barcelona, or Barca, as it is popularly known, did not win the battle of possession.One of the world's elite soccer teams, Barcelona has enjoyed success that stretches across decades. While borrowing from different soccer philosophies, Barca's style and system are unique in the soccer world. The principles by which the team plays, moreover, translate well into the world of investing. Let's review four hallmarks of Barcelona's style that have parallels in that most unheralded of sports: long-term equity investing.One-touch, two-touchThe Barcelona style is affectionately referred to by fans as ""Tiki-Taka"" soccer. Tiki-Taka is a Spanish onomatopoeic term roughly similar to ""click-clack,"" the sound of the ball being passed crisply from one player to the next using only one or two touches.  This makes for remarkably efficient ball movement and furthers the primary obsession of possessing the ball. The Tiki-Taka concept maximizes ball sharing between players.Outside game day, Barca players (whose average club salary would make any NBA owner reach for an Alka-Seltzer) relentlessly practice fundamental drills, some of which even preschoolers can emulate. In my personal favorite practice set, called ""rondo,"" players form a small circle, and play keep-away from two chasers in the middle, using one-touch passes. While the speed at which the team moves the ball can resemble a Japanese pachinko game, the underlying premise is utterly simple.Investing Parallel: Buy companies that structure themselves to exchange ideas quickly and fluently.Susan Wojcicki, employee number 16 at Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and now a senior vice president of product management and engineering with the company, had this to say on idea sharing in an insightful article entitled ""The Eight Pillars of Innovation:""By sharing everything, you encourage the discussion, exchange and reinterpretation of ideas, which can lead to unexpected and innovative outcomes. We try to facilitate this by working in small, crowded teams in open-cube arrangements, rather than individual offices.This past week, Google's share price crossed $1,000 on stellar earnings.This is due in no small part to the profusion of ideas that are monetized year in, year out at Google. Like the Barcelona rondo drill, companies that crowd teams together and share ideas quickly have an edge.Keep possession of the ballBy passing the ball among themselves and denying the opposition touches, Barcelona mathematically reduces their opponent's chances to score. Hoarding the rock also wears down the rival side, until a designated assassin such as Lionel Messi or Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (known simply as ""Neymar"") slices through the defense for the kill.While some criticize Tiki-Taka as boring, it requires an immense amount of physical skill and keen decision-making to keep the ball within your team's possession, to say nothing of the reserves of patience the team draws upon until it is the right time to strike. Investing Parallel: Buy companies that don't give up market share easily.While Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) revenue growth rate has slowed over the last few years, the company just recorded its 25th consecutive quarter of increased market share by value. And just as statistically, teams that control possession tend to win more games, companies that obsessively increase market share while retaining profitability tend to make great long-term investments.The importance of the triangleThe triangle is the basic unit of the Barcelona offense. During a game, three players loosely form into a triangle, and transfer the ball via those quick, one-touch passes. Approaching teammates from any angle instantly form more triangular possibilities. This forces other teams to run more and chase the ball while Barcelona players employ their keep-away skills, expending relatively less energy. It's a simple, logical, and efficient field formulation of which Euclid, the father of geometry, would no doubt approve.Investing parallel: Avoid companies whose business segments are organized inefficiently, and seek out companies with superior segment organization.Part of Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) current malaise is its patchwork of seven gargantuan and disparate business segments, which range from ""Printing"" to ""Storage and Networking"" to ""Enterprise Servers"" to ""HP Financial Services."" Another tech bellwether, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), describes itself as operating in just three businesses: hardware, software, and services.Which company do you think has an easier time focusing on its business?For the last several years, in any given quarter, Oracle's net profit margin has landed in a range of between 20% and 30%. HP's net profit margin -- when it's been positive -- has fluctuated between 2% and 8%. Keep the defensive line highWhen Barcelona moves the ball deep into enemy territory, the entire defensive line moves up. This puts enormous pressure on their adversaries, as the field effectively becomes smaller. As triangles multiply and the short passes fly, defense and offense merge into a single organism, zinging the ball at numerous angles, but moving it methodically ever closer to the goal.Investing parallel: invest in companies that understand how to keep pushing their defense (their existing legacy business / cash cow) while innovating in new areas.My favorite example of this philosophy is Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). Cisco has placed bets on a number of alternate revenue streams, for example, security, which is a small fraction (3.7% to be exact) of total yearly revenue of $48.6 billion.Yet while it expands these areas, the company never loses focus on its strength in networking. This has paid off recently, as a good chunk of computing that is migrating to the cloud runs through Cisco's networking. To quote CEO John Chambers from Cisco's last earnings call, networks are ""squarely at the center of the cloud, mobility, BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), [and] security..."" Parting 'shot on goal'There are many more investing insights you can glean from watching the sophisticated Barcelona side play. Are you a fan of soccer, or ""football"" as it is known in the rest of the world? Let me know in the comments section below what other investing parallels you notice when watching Barcelona.

Hewlett-Packard Company Looks Strong Before Earnings,"Feb 18, 2014 at 8:00PM","On Friday, shares of Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) closed at $30.02. This was the first time HP stock ended the day above $30 in two and a half years!HP has been through some rough sledding in recent years, but the business is finally stabilizing and the company is expected to post EPS growth this year for the first time since 2010.HP's two most important businesses -- printing and enterprise hardware -- ended the 2013 fiscal year with strong momentum. There's a good chance HP has maintained this momentum going into 2014. If HP's upcoming earnings report confirms this improving picture, HP stock could surge even higher.Long road back from chaosThe last time HP shares ended the day above $30 was August 17, 2011. (HP stock closed at $31.39.) The next day, HP issued a weak earnings forecast, discontinued its slow-selling WebOS-based smartphones and tablets, stated that it was buying British software firm Autonomy for more than $10 billion, and announced that it was considering a spinoff of its PC business!This marked the beginning of chaos at HP. Within a month, HP's board had given CEO Leo Apotheker the boot, replacing him with current CEO Meg Whitman. A few months later, HP decided to keep the PC business after all. A year after that, HP took a massive $8.8 billion writedown on its purchase of Autonomy, alleging that it had been defrauded because of improper accounting procedures at Autonomy.Incidentally, on the same day HP disclosed the Autonomy writedown, its stock bottomed out at $11.35. Since then, it has come roaring back, gaining more than 150% through the end of last week.HEWLETT-PACKARD 5 YEAR STOCK CHART, DATA BY YCHARTSSome of HP's gains can probably be attributed to the strong performance of the stock market. However, it has also started to show clear signs of progress in its turnaround.Signs of progressHP's two most important business segments are printing and the ""Enterprise Group,"" which primarily sells enterprise hardware like servers, storage, and networking. Together, these two businesses account for 70%-75% of HP's segment profit.These two businesses also happen to be the furthest ahead in the turnaround process. Luckily, while the PC and enterprise services businesses both continue to struggle, neither one is a particularly significant contributor to HP's earnings anymore.HP MAKES LOTS OF MONEY SELLING HIGH-MARGIN INK AND TONER.In printing, HP actually grew segment pre-tax earnings by 8.5% last year. HP is likely to deliver another year of strong earnings growth in the printing business in 2014. First, the company has been dialing back on sales of low-margin consumer printers in favor of commercial printers that will get heavy use and drive long-term sales of high-margin ink and toner. Commercial printer sales actually rose 9% in Q4 of 2013.Second, HP will continue to get a big margin benefit from the weak Japanese yen. The company sources toner and many printer components from Japan, so as the dollar appreciates against the yen, HP's costs decline.US DOLLAR TO JAPANESE YEN EXCHANGE RATE DATA BY YCHARTS.The Enterprise Group hasn't performed quite as well as printing. In fact, it posted a 17% decline in pre-tax earnings last year. That said, by Q4 it was showing clear signs of improvement, punctuated by a surprising return to revenue growth -- although earnings continued to decline.2014 could be a pivotal year for HP's Enterprise Group. The declining parts of the enterprise hardware business, such as UNIX servers and tape-based storage, are now small enough that their declines can be outweighed by growth businesses. This includes the ""Moonshot"" line of micro-servers and the 3PAR line of next-generation storage arrays. As these newer product lines scale up in the next few years, they should drive a return to profit growth in the Enterprise Group.Foolish bottom lineLast year, HP made significant progress turning around its two most profitable businesses. It also finished repairing its balance sheet, surpassing its target of reaching zero net debt by the end of 2013. This allows it to more aggressively return cash to shareholders.CEO Meg Whitman has previously warned that HP's turnaround progress will be uneven, so there is no guarantee that the upcoming earnings report will live up to expectations. However, with the printing and enterprise hardware businesses steadily improving throughout 2013, the general trend this year is likely to be positive. With HP's earnings multiple still sitting at about half the market average, the risk-reward trade-off for HP continues to look attractive."
How High Can Hewlett-Packard Company Stock Go?,"Apr 14, 2014 at 9:35AM","After plummeting in 2011 and 2012, shares of Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) have rebounded in the last year and a half. In fact, Hewlett-Packard stock has nearly tripled since bottoming out in November, 2012, and reached a new multiyear high just last week.HEWLETT-PACKARD FIVE-YEAR STOCK CHART. SOURCE: YCHARTS.During 2013, even as other tech powerhouses like International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) started to lose steam, HP made significant progress in its turnaround. In the last few quarters, HP has seen solid results from the printing and enterprise group business units, its two main profit drivers. (Those two segments accounted for about 75% of HP's pretax segment profit last year.)If Hewlett-Packard can demonstrate progress this year in fixing its enterprise services business -- which is the real ""problem child"" at HP today -- the stock could reach $40 by next year. That represents more than 20% upside to the current price.Margin growth in printingThe first part of Hewlett-Packard to return to health was the printing business, which historically has been HP's biggest cash cow. Printing revenue slipped 2.6% last year due to deflation for many printer components and supplies, but pretax profit for the printing business segment grew 8.5% year over year.HP'S PRINTING SEGMENT HAS RETURNED TO EARNINGS GROWTH.Printing segment earnings continued to increase last quarter, albeit at a more modest 1.2% pace. However, HP is paving the way for stronger earnings growth in this business unit in the next few years. Since the middle of FY13, HP has posted robust growth in printer unit sales, particularly for business customers. This will drive higher long-term sales of high-margin ink and toner.Enterprise hardware starts moving againHP's enterprise group, which sells hardware like servers, storage, and networking gear (and related support services), was the second part of HP to start showing signs of life. Through the first three quarters of FY13, enterprise group revenue was down 7.8% and pretax earnings had declined nearly 20%.However, enterprise group revenue has grown modestly for the last two quarters, and the rate of earnings decline has quickly dropped into the single digits. Obviously, this is still not good. That said, HP's enterprise group is made up of a variety of distinct product lines. A few of these are in long-term decline, but others are growing rapidly. The growth product lines include Moonshot low-power servers and 3PAR storage systems.The growth businesses are just starting to overtake the declining businesses in terms of importance. As this process plays out in the next year or two, revenue growth should strengthen and the enterprise group will return to earnings growth.While HP's enterprise hardware business is not where it needs to be yet, competitors like IBM are struggling even more. IBM's overall revenue declined 5% last year, and hardware was the biggest drag on its results.RECENTLY, IBM HAS HAD FAR MORE TROUBLE IN THE HARDWARE BUSINESS THAN HP.In fact, IBM disclosed that its hardware segment profit declined $1.7 billion year over year in 2013. IBM lost money in its hardware business last year, and evidently didn't think all of its problems were fixable. In January, IBM sold off its low-end server business to Lenovo for the bargain price of $2.3 billion. By comparison to IBM, HP's enterprise hardware business outlook is rosy.Looking aheadAs long as HP's printing and enterprise group business segments stay on track, HP investors should have nothing to worry about. However, for HP to return to robust earnings growth, it needs improvement in its troubled enterprise services segment. (The personal systems segment brings in a lot of revenue but is not very profitable and will -- at best -- stagnate in the long run.)The services business has been overstaffed and was one of the main targets of HP's ongoing job cuts. It still has an imbalance of revenue compared to its staffing level, and as a result its pretax profit margin has plummeted to 4% in FY12, 3% in FY13 and just 1% last quarter, well below the long-term target of 7%-9%.Nevertheless, HP executives reiterated on the most recent earnings call that they expect a 3.5%-4.5% operating margin for the enterprise services division in FY14. That implies that they expect rapid improvement in the next few quarters, presumably driven by HP's almost-completed cost-cutting program.Management also appears confident that the long-term 7%-9% margin target is achievable. That could be worth more than $1 billion in incremental pretax profit, even with no revenue growth.Foolish bottom lineHP has already brought its printing business back to profit growth. The recent return to revenue growth in its enterprise group is also promising. If HP's new enterprise hardware products stay on their current trajectory, the enterprise group will start contributing to earnings growth within the next year, even as problems linger at other competitors like IBM.The one other thing HP needs to complete its turnaround is a revival in its enterprise services segment. This is a $20 billion business that has the potential to generate high single-digit margins, but it has been making virtually no contribution to HP's earnings recently. If HP starts making real progress in enterprise services, a $40 stock price will be well within reach.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Which Tech Company Is the Most Dangerous Competitor in America?,"Mar 2, 2014 at 11:00AM","The tech industry has always been brutally competitive. Companies can grow to multibillion-dollar valuations on the back of a brilliant new breakthrough, only to lose it all in the span of a few years as powerful foes rush in with slightly superior alternatives at bargain-basement prices.The world's top tech companies are well aware of this constant challenge, and they're not shy about pointing out exactly which of their competitors pose the greatest threats. A couple of months ago, Bloomberg dug into the 10-K filings of the 50 largest tech companies on U.S. exchanges to find out which of them are most often mentioned in the ""risk factors and competition"" section -- you know, that wall of text many investors scroll past to get to the juicy financial details. You might be very surprised by which companies appear most frequently, so read on to discover the most dangerous companies in tech, or just scroll down to find the full top-10 rankings with additional data.10th through fifth placeThere were several ties in the latter half of this top-10 list, so we actually wind up with two 10th-place finishers, two eighth-place finishers, and two fifth-place finishers.Amazon.com and Cisco tied for 10th place on Bloomberg's most-dangerous list, with eight mentions apiece in the 50 largest tech companies' 10-Ks. Amazon's ranking seems surprisingly low, since it's a dominant force in both e-commerce and cloud computing, two of the most important elements of the modern Internet economy. Amazon has also expanded into streaming video, and has a payment-processing system in the works as well. Cisco, on the other hand, is the undisputed leader in networking equipment, which it's leveraged to build share in online security tools and business communications as well. That puts it in the crosshairs of several large antivirus makers, but it's not the only networking specialist with a monster market cap, either.Intel and recent leveraged-buyout target Dell tie for eighth place with nine out of 50 mentions each. Intel's placement is obvious -- as the world's largest chip maker, it's in direct competition with virtually every other major chip maker, and its ownership of security software maker McAfee puts it in the crosshairs of every major antivirus-software company as well. Computer maker Dell is a perennial threat to other large hardware companies, and its belated efforts to expand into software and enterprise solutions expands its list of domestic opponents dramatically.Samsung places seventh, with 11 call-outs from America's 50 largest tech companies. As one of the world's largest and most diversified electronics companies, Samsung not only makes smartphones and TVs, it also manufactures many of the chips that control the world's devices.SOURCE: ED FAVILA VIA FLICKR.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google tie for fifth place with 12 mentions apiece. Both companies compete in many of the same sectors of the tech world, including mobile (iOS and Android) and desktop computing (Macs and Chromebooks). Apple's integrated ecosystem threatens both hardware and software companies, while Google's reliance on data-driven advertising and its ownership of YouTube makes it a threat to major content- and media-focused tech companies. This ranking seems low for both companies, but more so for Google, which has a hand in so many parts of the tech ecosystem that it should surely threaten a wider range of competitors.Fourth place: OracleDatabase-software specialist Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) gets singled out by 13 of America's 50 largest tech companies as a major threat. Surprisingly, companies in segments as divergent as security software and data analytics think Oracle is dangerous -- but since Oracle is the second-largest software company by revenue in the world and boasts 400,000 customers worldwide, it probably has more competitors than it's even fully aware of -- and some of them might be using its programming tools to challenge other top tech companies as well. Oracle also offers a wide range of cloud-computing applications and platforms as well as a line of server hardware.SOURCE: DON DEBOLD VIA FLICKR.Third place: Hewlett-PackardPC and printer kingpin Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) competes with 15 of America's 50 largest tech companies in a wide range of hardware categories -- it also makes servers, smartphones (though it's unlikely that these are actually ""competing"" with anyone right now), and networking hardware -- and has also been steadily growing its software segment under current CEO Meg Whitman. HP competes with nearly every other company already on this list, and as its enterprise software and services efforts intensify, it's likely to come into the crosshairs of companies that might not have imagined having to fend off HP five or 10 years ago.Second place: MicrosoftWith 16 mentions from America's 50 largest tech companies -- a third of the list -- Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) claims second place on our most-dangerous list. Its operating system dominance is obviously a challenge to Apple. Its expansion into search got Google riled up. Its leadership in the game-console market (not to mention its game-development studio) worries game publishers. Its push into cloud computing makes Amazon and Oracle direct competitors. And now that it's got its own mobile-device manufacturer in Nokia's hardware segment, Microsoft is bound to find new challengers waiting for it in 2014.SOURCE: ALFRED LUI VIA FLICKR.America's most dangerous tech company: IBMAfter working our way through a list of industry leaders, it may be surprising that IBM (NYSE:IBM) worries more of its peers than any other tech company. With 18 mentions out of the top 50 tech companies, IBM is clearly a big threat, but why? Bloomberg points out that IBM's business-services focus has given it an inside track to IT departments in many of the world's largest companies, which has been a popular avenue of growth for companies ranging from HP to Cisco.IBM's leadership in the nascent Big Data field, and its development of artificial intelligence systems such as Watson, also make it dangerous to a number of analytics-driven tech companies. IBM is also by far the most prolific patent hoarder in America, which can make it dangerous even when it's not trying to challenge anyone directly. However, it's possible that IBM's rank will slip next year, since it recently sold off its server-hardware segment, which was one of the world's largest server vendors in 2013.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

How Kodak Is Recovering From Bankruptcy,"Mar 24, 2014 at 8:15PM","Once regarded as a solid blue-chip company, Eastman Kodak (NYSE:KODK) began to struggle financially in the late 1990s due to a continuous decline in sales of photographic film. Kodak's management failed to identify digital photography as a disruptive technology, and the company eventually ended up filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2012, and had to sell its photographic film, patents, commercial scanners and even kiosk operations in order to survive.In September 2013, the company emerged from bankruptcy after exiting several failed businesses. Now, the company has a new business plan, which focuses on commercial imaging and printing, a space where competitors Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Fujifilm Holdings are quite strong. Has Kodak learned its lesson? How exactly does the company plan to turn losses into profits, and become a leader in commercial imaging?SOURCE: EASTMAN KODAK INVESTOR RELATIONSA narrow focusThe new Kodak plans to focus on commercial imaging and graphics, together with providing digital printing solutions to businesses. In the past few quarters, the company exited, divested, or harvested most of its non-core businesses and assets. This allowed the company to eliminate various legacy liabilities, including losses related to Kodak Gallery, which was once the company's consumer online digital photography website and served more than 60 million users at its peak. CompetitorsThe commercial imaging space is dominated by Hewlett-Packard, which owns a wide portfolio of industrial printing solutions. Hewlett-Packard's Indigo Division has several years of experience developing and marketing digital, offset printing presses, consumables and workflow solutions.Fujifilm Holdings is another important name in the commercial printing space. The company is a leading manufacturer of computer-to-plate systems, which allows printing companies to make printing plates directly from computer data, skipping the film stage. Fujifilm manufacturers offset printing plates in China, Japan, the United States, and the Netherlands.Innovation and brandingTo compete against these giants, Kodak will have to put innovation first. As Forbes contributor John Kotter notes, the company must encourage and welcome pie-in-the-sky ideas.Note that most of Kodak's patent portfolio has been sold off. However, the company still retains great technology and engineers. For example, a team of more than 100 engineers have worked for more than five years to create Kodak Stream Inkjet Technology, which delivers offset-class output with the ability to perform high-speed, variable-data printing at low cost. More important, Kodak is still a highly recognizable brand. Early resultsIt's too early to know if Kodak's new business plan will succeed. The company ended 2013 still in the red. Kodak's overall sales for 2013 came in at $2.35 billion. Revenue for the most recent quarter came in at $607 million, down from $739 million a year earlier. Sales, which fell 12% at the company's graphics, entertainment, and commercial films business, were not enough to prevent a net loss of $63 million.On the bright side, net loss is down from $402 million a year ago. 2014 will certainly be a key year for the company, and investors should monitor both revenue and profitability figures in detail. The company is not forecasting a major turnaround, and it forecasts sales volume for 2014 in the $2.1 billion-$2.3 billion range.Final Foolish takeawayKodak, once a powerful player in the imaging and photography industry, is trying to recover by narrowing its business focus. The new Kodak plans to gradually become a leader in the commercial imaging industry, a space currently dominated by Hewlett-Packard and Fujifilm. Although the company has made some progress in reducing its net loss per quarter, it's too early to know if Kodak's new business plan will succeed.10 stocks we like better than Eastman KodakWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

5 Years Since Stocks Crashed: How Has the Bull Market Grown Since 2009?,"Mar 9, 2014 at 9:48AM","A lot can happen in five years. A newborn baby might become a kindergartener, a new president might be elected, a hot new website might grow from a user base of 100 million to more than a billion -- and a surging bull market can begin and end. In fact, one recent bull market continued for exactly five years before it fell apart in horrific fashion. The crash that followed was the worst to strike down the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) since the Great Depression. The crash ended on March 9, 2009, exactly five years ago today, and if the Dow can push past the all-time high it reached at the end of 2013, it, too, will be a five-year-strong bull market -- and it might go much further still.But how sustainable is the current rally? That depends on a number of factors, not the least of which include corporate profits, market valuations, investor sentiment, and economic stability. We can't know for certain if any of these important factors will continue to improve, but we can look back at the market's five-year rebound to see how each factor has affected it.Let's start with a simple comparison between the two most notable stock indexes in America, the Dow and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC). We can't expect them to match up exactly, but have they at least kept closely in track with each other? Surprisingly, the Dow has fallen rather far behind its broader peer, an underperformance that began roughly in mid-2012:^SPX DATA BY YCHARTSWhat's caused this discrepancy? Until the fall of 2013, the Dow had two notable underperformers in Alcoa, which recorded a 61% gain to the Dow's 136%, and Hewlett-Packard, which lost 10% from the start of the rebound to the day of its removal. IBM, historically the most heavily weighted Dow component, has also underperformed the Dow since the rebound began, even when reinvested dividends are taken into account.There is certainly more data available on the S&P 500's performance, so let's dig a little deeper into that index's performance since March 9, 2009. Let's start with the difference between the index and its dividend-adjusted total return (which you can actually achieve or best by investing in one of many S&P 500-based dividend-paying index funds, like the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT:SDY)):^SPX DATA BY YCHARTSDividends do make a bit of difference for the S&P 500, as its return swells by another 31.5% over its baseline growth when reinvestment comes into play.

For one thing, the S&P's aggregate earnings fell off a cliff during the financial crisis, but have since recovered to the highest level ever seen, in both nominal and real terms:S&P 500 REAL EARNINGS DATA BY YCHARTSThe current bull market started its earnings rebound from such a wretchedly low starting point that we may never again see the kind of bottom-line growth the S&P 500's components have strung together since 2009. In fact, the current bull market boasts by a very wide margin the largest real earnings growth of S&P 500 components out of any expansionary period in over 100 years of analysis by economist Robert Shiller (we'll focus on only the larger bull markets for brevity):Bull MarketReal Earnings GrowthTotal Market* Growth2009-present1,170%**150.8%2002-2007132.3%94.4%1990-200076.8%395.7%1982-1987(7.1%)250.4%1962-196643.4%85.8%1957-1961(15%)74.9%1949-195637.1%222.4%1942-1946(24.5%)128.7%1932-1937111.2%371.6%1921-1929241%496.5%1896-189967.6% 170.8%SOURCE: YCHARTS AND ROBERT SHILLER.*GROWTH OF DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE USED BECAUSE OF MORE ACCURATE DAILY CLOSING DATA.**EARNINGS GROWTH ONLY CURRENT TO Q3 2013.It's worth noting that if we start from a point at which the S&P 500's earnings weren't at historic lows, then real earnings growth looks far more modest -- stretching our date range back to March 2008 rather than 2009, at which point earnings were rapidly sliding but not completely over the edge, gives us real earnings growth of 45.3%.Neither dividends nor earnings growth can really account for all of the gains in a bull market, because investors will inevitably bid up stocks faster than the companies behind them can increase earnings. This, in a nutshell, is valuation expansion, and we often use the cyclically adjusted P/E ratio, or CAPE, developed by Robert Shiller to smooth out the wild swings in valuation you might see in a crash like the one from which we've been recovering for the past five years. Here's how much the CAPE has grown since the start of the current bull market:^SPX DATA BY YCHARTSAccording to this metric, a little less than half of the current market's gains can be explained by valuation expansion, which is roughly in line with the valuation expansion seen in several other durable bull markets, as I examined last year (click here to learn more). However, bearish analysts are often keen to point out that the CAPE itself is now reaching back toward the levels it last left behind during the financial-crisis crash:S&P 500 CYCLICALLY ADJUSTED PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO DATA BY YCHARTSThis alone may not be enough to justify alarm, but it all depends on how you interpret the other valuation metrics available to us as informed investors. Late last year, Josh Brown published research done by Merrill Lynch's Savita Subramanian that showed 12 of 15 valuation metrics -- including various P/E ratios, EV/EBITDA, price-to-free-cash-flow, price-to-book-value, and some other esoteric measures -- were historically undervalued compared to more recent averages. Shiller's metric has been calculated since 1871, which is about as similar to our current market environment as a steam locomotive is to a 747. Brown has also written extensively on why the CAPE itself may not be as relevant to modern investors as many would like to believe. On the other hand, Orcam Financial Services founder and Pragmatic Capitalism blogger Cullen Roche found that certain broad-based valuation metrics, like gross national product to total stock market capitalization, and equity prices to revenues, corroborate the CAPE's apparent warnings of overvaluation.Is today's market overvalued? Is it just getting started? The answer could be right in front of us, waiting to be discovered any day now.10 better buys than the Dow Jones Industrial AverageWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Enormous Issues With the United States Economy,"Feb 8, 2014 at 3:30PM","The United States economy is in trouble. Employment is the backbone of any economy, and there are three reasons jobs today just ain't as sweet as they used to be. Here's why Americans are getting paid less, getting fired, or are just giving up altogether.1. Uneducated only, pleaseThe United States economy was built on the backs of John Rockefeller, Henry Ford, Rosie the Riveter, and countless others who transformed our nation into a manufacturing machine.In 1960, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) was the largest employer, putting 595,200 Americans to work. That's 0.8% of the entire work force, and a whopping 3.5% of all manufacturing jobs.SOURCE: GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY; 1960 CHEVROLET CORVETTE CONVERTIBLE. But while manufacturing has brought the United States economy unprecedented wealth, it's recently been more headache than help. Outsourcing, improved technology, and a global recession have mangled manufacturing's role as America's everlasting employer.Since its 2009 bailout, General Motors Company has been cutting jobs and trading out high-paid workers for cheaper labor. The automaker has hired around 18,000 hourly production workers, allowing the company to remove skilled trade jobs. The Center for Automotive Research says General Motors Company saves approximately $57,000 a year when it hands a pink slip to a high-skilled $32-per-hour earner and hires a $15-per-hour employee instead.2. Subsisting on servicesBut manufacturing might not even matter much to the United States economy. Today, the sector employs around one-tenth of America's workforce, while the services sector has soared to nearly 90%.General Motors Company topped the top employer list in 1960, but the biggest spots in 2010 were all filled by services corporations. In first place, Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) employed an astounding 2.1 million people -- that's equal to the population of Houston, the country's fourth-largest city.The biggest goods-producing employer in 2010 was Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ), with just 324,600 employees. Not only is that less than General Motors Company employed in 1960, but it's shrinking even more. Hewlett-Packard Company announced on New Year's Eve that it will cut 5,000 more jobs, bringing its total termination count to 34,000 -- 11% of its entire workforce.  For a closer look at services, the Bureau of Labor Statistics periodically releases data on the hottest occupations in the United States economy. For May 2012 (the most recent data available), retail salespersons, cashiers, and restaurant workers snagged the top three spots. Collectively, these three industries alone employ a staggering 10.6 million Americans.SOURCE: BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS But the news isn't all good for services. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also tracks hourly wages, and our nation's largest employers are also paying pennies compared to manufacturing. While General Motors Company is happy to hire $15-per-hour workers, the average cashier makes just $9.21.The lowest earners list is littered with services workers. Food preparation workers have it worst, earning just $7.92 per hour. That's lower than the minimum wage for 15 states.SOURCE: BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. 3. Giving up for goodSOURCE: NATIONAL ARCHIVES; UNEMPLOYED WAIT OUTSIDE A SOUP KITCHEN IN 1931. While the services sector keeps its employees on subsistence wages and manufacturing jobs continue to get cut, the biggest problem may be getting workers to work-period. The global financial crisis pushed the United States economy's unemployment rate from an enviable 4.5% to an ugly 10% in just two years' time.US UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DATA BY YCHARTSBut although rates are back down to 6.7%, it's not because employers are hiring. Many Americans are simply giving up and leaving the work force altogether, making numbers look better than they actually are. Since 2007, the number of employable Americans looking for work has dropped from 66.4% to a measly 62.8%, the lowest since 1978.US LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE DATA BY YCHARTS.The future of the United States economyThe United States economy is in a rut. Although the Federal Reserve recently noted that things have ""picked up"" in recent quarters, it described labor market indicators as ""mixed."" With current movements between manufacturing and services, as well as in and out of the economy altogether, it's easy to understand why. Employment is the undisputed backbone to the United States economy, allowing America to both produce and purchase."
Revealed: How 3D Systems Corporation Views Competitive Threats,"May 2, 2014 at 10:45AM","During 3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) 2014 first-quarter-earnings call, it came to light how the 3-D printing giant views competitive threats from Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ). Although mindful of the competition, 3D Systems believes its business is more vertically integrated, and therefore gives it a first-mover advantage over the competition.Oh, the irony!In an effort to broaden its horizons, Stratasys recently made a greater push into the 3-D printing service bureau space when it purchased Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies, two leading independent 3-D printing service providers in the U.S. Together, with its existing Redeye 3-D printing service bureau, Stratasys will consolidate its servicing operations into a streamlined solution, offering a wider range of 3-D printing services, including small batch direct manufacturing with metal alloys.For Stratasys, the greater push into the servicing space makes a lot of sense because it diversifies its technology portfolio, broadens its manufacturing expertise, builds out its sales channel, and potentially expands its customer base. The irony with this move is that Stratasys only sells 3-D printers based on two primary technologies, and in order to become a fully streamlined 3-D printing service bureau, it likely has to adopt 3-D printing technologies from 3D Systems, which offers seven different technologies under its umbrella.According 3D Systems CEO Avi Reichental, the service centers Stratasys purchased were ""by and large"" already using its stereolithography, selective laser sintering, and direct metal 3-D printers. In other words, the potential exists for 3D Systems to win future purchase orders from Stratasys as it streamlines and grows its service operations.It's complicatedAs far as Hewlett-Packard is concerned, Reichental acknowledged that it takes HP very seriously because it has ""unlimited resources, capabilities, and technologies."" As terrifying as this sounds to 3D Systems investors, Reichental doesn't underestimate the high level of complexity required to become a meaningful and relevant 3-D printing player in the design and manufacturing world. Realistically, it'll likely take years until HP can reasonably be considered a formidable competitor.In Reichental's view, a multi-faceted approach involving different 3-D printing technologies is the only way to make a big impact in the space. Emphasizing a diverse 3-D printing portfolio makes sense from a business perspective because different 3-D printing applications are best suited for different technologies. The technology needed to produce a titanium medical implant device is dramatically different than technology that produces plastic automotive dashboard prototypes. The company with the most diverse 3-D printing portfolio can cater to the most 3-D printing applications.Still, investors should continue to monitor Hewlett-Packard's entry into the space, only because HP has deeper pockets than what the worldwide 3-D printing industry generated in annual sales last year.A first-mover advantage?3D Systems believes it has a first-mover advantage over the competition because no other 3-D printing company offers as expansive of a 3-D printing portfolio. In order to subscribe to this statement, deeper vertical integration will have to become an increasingly predominant theme throughout the 3-D printing industry so that competitors would have no choice but to build or acquire a broader portfolio. If the industry does in fact move in this direction, it would put 3D Systems and its already established portfolio of seven 3-D printing technologies in a rather opportune position while the industry mobilized.The jury may still be out on how this will all shake out, but Stratasys' recent emphasis on services and diversification certainly puts some weight behind this line of thinking. Going forward, investors should watch how 3D Systems deepens its level of integration and continues to differentiate itself from the competition.10 stocks we like better than 3D SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why IBM Is Selling Its Server Business to Lenovo,"Jan 27, 2014 at 8:30PM","The world's largest PC manufacturer, Chinese technology company Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY), will pay $2 billion in cash and $300 million in stock to acquire IBM's (NYSE:IBM) x86 low-end server business, also known as System X.This is not the first time Lenovo acquired a business unit from Big Blue. In 2005, the company acquired IBM's ThinkPad line of PCs. The company eventually ended up becoming the biggest player in the PC arena. A shrinking PC industry was no impediment for Lenovo to establish a profitable PC business, helped by economies of scale and high quality standards in manufacturing. Lenovo posted a 36% hike in profits last November, but Lenovo wants more. It aims to conquer the smartphone space, and now, the low-end server market.IBM winsOverall, the latest acquisition seems to be a win-win situation for both Lenovo and IBM. Big Blue's low-end server business has been shrinking for a while, hurting the company's bottom line. This move also reduces IBM's dependency on hardware significantly. That's exactly what the company wants. Big Blue's new business priorities in its 2015 road map are cloud computing, Smarter Planet, business analytics, and growth markets. Moreover, between 2010 and 2013, the company spent roughly $12 billion in acquisitions, buying mainly software companies in the cloud space. There will always be a place for hardwareNote that although IBM is emphasizing software nowadays, the company is not retiring completely from the server world. It plans to stay in the high-end server and mainframe business, focusing on its System Z and Power lines, together with its storage systems.In other words, Big Blue is basically selling the low-margin, high-volume segment. This is consistent with IBM's new strategy, which focuses on high-margin software sales, and using mainframe and System Z technologies as a way to cross-sell its recurrent service and profitable support contracts.Apart from getting $2 billion in cash, IBM will have permission to continue selling System X servers as a reseller partner for Lenovo. Unlike System Z -- mainframe servers for large corporations -- IBM's System X portfolio of servers was basically targeted at mid-sized corporations, hosting companies, and clients with small cloud needs.Lenovo wins, Hewlett-Packard losesThe recent acquisition puts Lenovo in a better position to compete against Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Dell in the server market.Hewlett-Packard will now face a rival that isn't afraid of aggressive pricing to capture market share. In the third quarter of the past year, Hewlett-Packard had the largest share in the $9.5 billion low-end server market, according to IDC.This could change dramatically in the coming quarters, because the latest acquisition is expected to move Lenovo ahead five years in its plan to expand in servers, raising its global ranking among suppliers from No. 6 to No. 3, according to Peter Hortensius, senior vice president at Lenovo. Final Foolish takeawayThe acquisition of IBM's low-end server business by Lenovo may be a win-win situation. IBM, which reported its seventh straight quarter of declining revenue last week, is trying to reinvent itself once more by focusing on high-growth areas, such as cloud computing and software.The deal will also give Lenovo about 12% of the world's server market. Although the acquired business unit is barely profitable, by increasing sales volume, Lenovo could transform IBM's low-end server unit into a cash-flow machine, as the company is well-known for using an aggressive pricing strategy combined with high-quality quality control to successfully capture market share.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Is Xerox Destined for Greatness?,"Jan 13, 2014 at 11:45AM","Investors love stocks that consistently beat the Street without getting ahead of their fundamentals and risking a meltdown. The best stocks offer sustainable market-beating gains, with robust and improving financial metrics that support strong price growth. Does Xerox (NYSE:XRX) fit the bill? Let's take a look at what its recent results tell us about its potential for future gains.What we're looking forThe graphs you're about to see tell Xerox's story, and we'll be grading the quality of that story in several ways:Growth: Are profits, margins, and free cash flow all increasing?Valuation: Is share price growing in line with earnings per share?Opportunities: Is return on equity increasing while debt to equity declines?Dividends: Are dividends consistently growing in a sustainable way?What the numbers tell youNow, let's take a look at Xerox's key statistics:XRX TOTAL RETURN PRICE DATA BY YCHARTS.Passing Criteria3-Year* ChangeGradeRevenue growth > 30%12.9%FailImproving profit margin71.1%PassFree cash flow growth > Net income growth37.5% vs. 93.2%FailImproving EPS87.9%PassStock growth (+ 15%) < EPS growth24.2% vs. 87.9%PassSOURCE: YCHARTS. * PERIOD BEGINS AT END OF Q3 2010.XRX RETURN ON EQUITY (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.Passing Criteria3-Year* ChangeGradeImproving return on equity62.7%PassDeclining debt to equity(5.2%)PassDividend growth > 25%35.3%PassFree cash flow payout ratio < 50%10.8%PassSOURCE: YCHARTS. * PERIOD BEGINS AT END OF Q3 2010.How we got here and where we're goingXerox comes through with flying colors by scoring seven out of nine possible passing grades in its second assessment, which is the same score it earned last year. One of those failing grades was only awarded because net income growth has surpassed the gains in free cash flow during the three-year tracking period -- however, Xerox's nominal free cash flow is actually higher than its net income, and has been trending higher in recent quarters even as the bottom line stagnates. Unfortunately, Xerox's revenue growth has also stagnated due to the long-term decline in its document technology segment. How might Xerox push its revenue growth over the next few years and improve on its few minor weaknesses and become a truly great stock? Let's dig a little deeper to find out.Xerox recently delivered lackluster third-quarter results, an outcome dragged down by dwindling demand for printers and copiers around the world. However, Xerox's shares spent much of 2013 in an upswing on news that the company is aiming for another round of restructuring to get rid of non-core assets and find new revenue growth from long-term IT-service-based contracts. Fool contributor Tim Brugger notes that Xerox recently sold a portion of its solid ink engineering and development business to 3-D printer leader 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) in a deal worth $32.5 million in cash. A long-term partnership between Xerox and 3D Systems might allow Xerox to leverage new 3-D printing capabilities to find new revenue streams from its business hardware clients.In addition to this, Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) subsidiary is also developing a unique technology to print electronic circuitry, which isn't part of the sale to 3D Systems. Xerox also recently announced the acquisition of German customer care service provider Invoco, which beefs up its business process outsourcing capabilities in overseas and emerging markets. Fool contributor Sean Williams points out that the move is a clear example of Xerox's turnaround plan in action -- this strategy aims to produce more than two-thirds of Xerox's total revenue from IT services within five years -- includes diversification efforts away from its highly commoditized printing business.Xerox should also benefit from Obamacare health reforms as the company is highly involved in processing Medicaid claims, payment processing, and state-run exchange development. It is solely responsible for processing Medicaid claims in the state of California, and has also been responsible for designing Nevada's state-run health exchange. California plans to sign up about 1.4 million newly insured people for Medicaid, which will certainly boost demand for Xerox's document processing services. Xerox's subsidiary Buck Consultants has built an employer-based privatized exchange called RightOpt to help retirees manage their corporate health benefits plan. Quite recently, Xerox also inked a $100 million deal with the Texas Department of Transportation to deliver toll processing and invoicing services.Putting the pieces togetherToday, Xerox has many of the qualities that make up a great stock, but no stock is truly perfect. Digging deeper can help you uncover the answers you need to make a great buy -- or to stay away from a stock that's going nowhere."
3 Reasons Lenovo's Purchase of Motorola Will Succeed Where Google Failed,"Jan 31, 2014 at 3:15PM","Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) just sold Motorola Mobility, one of its worst acquisitions ever, to Chinese tech giant Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY) for $2.9 billion -- a steep discount from the $12.5 billion it had paid for the company back in August 2011.Lenovo gets the entire Motorola brand, including the recently launched Moto X and Moto G handsets, as well as more than 2,000 patent assets. Google, however, will retain the majority of the Motorola's original patent portfolio.MOTO G (L) AND MOTO X (R). (SOURCE: BLOGSCOMPUTERWORLD.COM)This is a humbling move for Google and a thrilling new development for Lenovo, which has grown into the world's largest PC manufacturer through the acquisitions of IBM's (NYSE:IBM) personal computer and low-end server businesses, leaving Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) in the dust.There are doubts regarding Lenovo's ability to revive the Motorola brand, which at its peak (2006) accounted for 22% of the mobile phone market, but I truly believe that Lenovo will do a much better job than Google at rebuilding the fallen brand's reputation in the mobile marketplace.Let's take a look at the three top reasons:1. A solid reputation of transforming brandsWe're all too familiar with Hewlett-Packard's excuse for its poor performance over the past three years: the rise of smartphones and tablets have turned its traditional business model of personal computers upside down.While it's true that global PC shipments fell 10% year-over-year in 2013, Lenovo has survived unscathed:CompanyGlobal market share (4Q)YOY growth in shipmentsLenovo17.1%2.7%Hewlett-Packard16.6%(10.3%)Dell12%(2.4%)Acer Group7.6%(28.5%)SOURCE: IDC.IDC's numbers strongly indicate that Lenovo's gains in a shrinking market were made at the expense of its rivals. Therefore, although PCs might not be that appealing anymore, Lenovo's products -- especially its hybrid devices -- are still winning over customers.None of this would have been possible if it weren't for Lenovo's 2005 acquisition of IBM's personal computer business for $1.25 billion, which added IBM's iconic ThinkPad brand to its portfolio.LENOVO'S THINKPAD YOGA. (SOURCE: LENOVO)Over the years, Lenovo transformed the ThinkPad brand from a stodgy line of business laptops into a fresh line of hybrid devices, convertible laptops, and tablets -- most of which were well received commercially and critically:ProductRelease dateForm factorCNET ratingThinkPad Yoga2013Hybrid4/5ThinkPad Twist2012Hybrid4/5ThinkPad Helix2013Convertible3.5/5ThinkPad Tablet2011Tablet3.5/5ThinkPad Tablet 22013Tablet3.5/5Yoga Tablet2013Tablet2.5/5SOURCES: CNET.COM.Lenovo also put its entire line of traditional laptops through the redesign blender from 2012 to 2013, in an effort to streamline its designs and make them more appealing to business users. In other words, whereas Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) tried to make consumer electronics cool again, Lenovo tried to make business laptops more aesthetically pleasing.Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that Lenovo has a similarly ambitious plan in mind for Motorola that could dwarf Google's Moto G and Moto X efforts.2. An established footprint in mobile hardwareAccording to IDC, Lenovo is currently the fourth largest smartphone maker in the world, with a 4.9% share of the global market, up from 4.1% a year earlier.Combining its share with Motorola's tiny sliver of the market bumps Lenovo share up to 6.4%, making it the third largest manufacturer after Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) and Apple.LENOVO'S K900 ANDROID SMARTPHONE. (SOURCE: LENOVO)Although Lenovo's share is still dwarfed by Samsung's 28.8% and Apple's 17.9%, shipments of its mobile devices surged 50% year-over-year last quarter.Lenovo is the only major Wintel PC manufacturer that has successfully dented the smartphone market. Previous efforts by Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Acer, and Asus have failed due to poor designs, bad market timing, or poor marketing efforts. Lenovo's smartphones succeeded for two simple reasons -- they arrived fairly early (2009) and went with Android.Lenovo smartphones aren't widely used in the U.S., but they account for 11.8% of China's lucrative smartphone market, putting it ahead of Apple (6.2%) but behind Samsung (21.2%).Claiming the well-known Motorola brand could help Lenovo finally grow its U.S. smartphone market share as well.3. Marketing muscle and celebrity wattageLenovo also has the marketing muscle to succeed where Google failed.Google's $500 million U.S. marketing blitz for the Moto G and X yielded mixed results, including the bizarre ""Lazy Phone"" ads and some sexually charged ads encouraging people to ""touch each other"" instead of their phones.Google's clumsy ads looked much sloppier than Apple's minimalist approach and the crisp and catchy ""Hello Moto"" ads that Motorola was once known for.Lenovo, by comparison, has hired both Kobe Bryant and Ashton Kutcher as its spokesmen.Lenovo even gave Kutcher a real role as a product engineer at Lenovo, where he offers hardware and software design advice. Regarding the role, Kutcher stated that he wanted to help make Lenovo's ""products as consumer-friendly as possible.""ASHTON KUTCHER CHANNELING STEVE JOBS AS LENOVO'S NEW PRODUCT ENGINEER. (SOURCE: BUSINESSINSIDER.COM)It's a gimmicky but inspired choice, considering Kutcher's own interest in tech investments and his recent role as Apple founder Steve Jobs in Joshua Michael Stern's biopic Jobs.By hiring Bryant and Kutcher, it's clear that Lenovo wants to be identified as a mainstream U.S. company. Now, with a more recognizable brand like Motorola under its belt, Lenovo will put much more effort into its marketing efforts than Google ever did -- and that could finally make Moto relevant again.The bottom lineLooking forward, will Lenovo follow through with Google's strategy of only marketing a lower-end handset (Moto G) and a higher-end one (Moto X), or will it split the brand into a wider range of phones, similar to the strategy employed by countless other Android handset manufacturers?One thing remains certain, however -- Lenovo's acquisition of Motorola could shake up the handset industry the same way its acquisition of IBM's personal computer business did to the PC market. Just as HP and Dell eventually yielded to Lenovo in the PC arena, so could Apple and Samsung in the smartphone race over the next few years.What do you think, dear readers?

Where Are the AMD Tablets?,"Mar 29, 2014 at 6:30PM","It seems that every year AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) makes a pretty large fuss about a next-generation mobile product, but year after year these products don't materialize in many shipping designs. Some argue that the same argument could be applied to larger PC chip rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), but there are numerous quality Windows-based tablets shipping with Intel silicon, even if Intel's Bay Trail on Android continues to be MIA. So a simple question that AMD investors should try to answer is: Where are all of the AMD tablets?A trip to AMD's website: Trying to buy an AMD tabletTo see what kind of progress AMD has made in securing tablet designs, a trip to AMD's website is in order. Clicking on the ""where to buy"" button on AMD's tablet page reveals some interesting results. Of the 10 tablets available in total, the breakdown by chip is as follows:AMD Dual-Core A4 Series: four tablets.AMD Dual-Core Z-Series APU: three tablets.AMD Quad-Core A6-Series: three tablets.Of the four dual-core A4 based devices, three were 11.6-inch designs and one was a 13.3-inch detachable Windows 8 PC. Not a single one was a ""tablet"" in the sense of a traditional 10.1-inch or 9.7-inch design. Of the quad-core A6 based devices, all three were 13.3-inch designs from Hewlett-Packard. And naturally, the older Z-series APU based designs weren't anything to write home about, particularly as reviews panned both the performance and battery lives of products based on this chip (since the chip was unsuitable for thin and light tablets).Compare that with IntelSince AMD's chips are only targeted toward Windows right now, its only real competitor in the Windows tablet chip space is Intel, so a comparison is appropriate. Today there are a number of tablets with Bay Trail, Intel's latest 22-nanometer tablet-oriented chip, from many vendors, including:ASUS.Acer.Fujitsu.Dell.Sharp.Lenovo.Toshiba.Ramos.These designs come in both 10.1-inch and 8-inch flavors, and these tablets have gotten pretty solid reviews for their performance and battery life. Of course, there are varying degrees of quality across the vendors (and Windows tablets aren't anywhere near as big of a market as Android and iOS tablets are), and you'll probably notice that these are relatively small names in the tablet market, but the breadth and quality of the offerings looks markedly higher than those powered by AMD.Will Mullins do the trick?When the Z-60 came out, it was ""wait for Temash"". Now that Temash is out, about, and garnering very little design win traction, AMD has been talking up its successor SoC for tablets code-named Mullins. Mullins apparently features an updated CPU core (probably with more aggressive Turbo) and at the system-on-a-chip level manages to bring power down.This may be as a result of removing some of the I/Os that are PC-use only (similar to what Intel did with Bay Trail-T versus Bay Trail-M) as well as some architectural optimizations and enhancements. Only time will tell whether Mullins can finally find its way in competitive Windows-based tablets, but by then AMD will be contending with Intel's next-generation Cherry Trail. Foolish bottom lineWhile AMD has talked a big game, particularly around tablets, it simply has yet to deliver the goods in terms of the right product (AMD's current tablet offerings are missing several key IP blocks for tablets such as a dedicated image signal processor) at the right time in the right designs. And even if AMD sorts its product story out, the right chip is only just the beginning in this highly competitive, cutthroat industry. It is a necessary, but insufficient, condition to long-term business success.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

1 Reason Why Google -- Not Apple or ExxonMobil -- Will Be the Most Valuable Company by 2017,"Jan 22, 2014 at 9:30PM","Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is my largest personal stock holding, both by percentage of portfolio and dollars invested. I'm a fan of the company, and I agree with CEO Tim Cook's apparent hesitation to either make a splashy acquisition or return a large amount of Apple's growing mountain of cash to shareholders.  I love the company's discipline and insistence on developing innovative and excellent products, as opposed to simply getting in on a market or a trend with a lackluster offering. This extension of the late Steve Jobs' mentality about only doing something if it can be done better than someone else, has helped Apple remain a fantastic investment. Similarly, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) sits atop the ""Big Oil"" heap, largely a product of incredible discipline to the specific goal of generating returns. When measured using Return on Capital Employed, or ROCE, a common measure of energy companies, ExxonMobil is head-and-shoulders above its peers. Increasing demand for cheap energy as the world's population -- especially the global middle class -- grows will keep ExxonMobil one of the world's most valuable companies. But, looking into the future, neither of these two companies is as well-positioned for growth as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The biggest reason? Google is plugged into the most valuable commodity of all -- more valuable than oil or the cache of an elite brand -- information. Google is willing to experiment on everything from the mundane to the outlandish, just to continue giving us that information for free. It's already cutting the distance down:AAPL MARKET CAP DATA BY YCHARTSDon't believe me? Let's take a closer look.Investor return isn't always about company growth  EVEN WITH THE $31 BILLION IN STOCK TO BUY XTO ENERGY, EXXONMOBIL'S SHARE COUNT HAS DECLINED OVER THE PAST DECADE. SOURCE: WIKIMEDIA COMMONSFor investors, the return from an investment in ExxonMobil will largely be a product of two things: share buybacks and dividend growth. A decade ago, the company had more than 6.5 billion shares outstanding. Today, that number is less than 4.4 billion, a 31% reduction. For investors who have held their shares, they now own almost one-third more of ExxonMobil than before, without having had to buy another share. The company has also consistently raised its quarterly dividend, from $0.25 per share in 2002 to $0.63 per share today, which equates to a 2.5% yield if you bought shares today. But, if you had purchased shares in 2002 for around $45, you'd be getting a nearly 6% annual return on your initial investment, just from the dividend. While incredibly rewarding for shareholders, neither of these characteristics make ExxonMobil a bigger or more valuable company. However, increasing strife in the Middle East, as well as record discoveries of offshore and shale oil and gas, all point toward stagnant -- or even lower -- energy prices over the next several years. That scenario could have a profound impact on ExxonMobil's value. How can Apple change the world (again)?iPhone at MacWorld in 2007. Source: Flickr contributor blakeburrisApple legitimately started the mobile revolution. The way we engage our computers has been forever altered by the iPhone, iPad, and previously, the iPod. Today, the traditional computer industry is cracking at the seams as demand falls and fixed costs for manufacturers, like Hewlett-Packard and Dell, weigh on the giants in this dying industry.Even the growing smartphone and tablet businesses are generating less income for Apple today, as competitors like Google and Samsung take more market share. While the recent deal with China Mobile clearly offers huge upside, there's little reason to expect Apple to launch another category-killing or -creating product in the near future. Frankly, it would be unwise to bet on any company being able to do -- just once -- what Apple has managed to do several times over the past 15 years. Expecting that Cook and Co. will be more like ExxonMobil, buying back shares at reasonable rates while steadily increasing the dividend, is a more plausible thesis. Google is differentGOOGLE SELF-DRIVING CAR. SOURCE: STEVE JURVETSONGoogle's willingness to experiment with ideas like Glass and self-driving cars, together with the gall to spend $3.2 billion on a company that makes thermostats and smoke detectors, points at a common theme within the company: capture as much data about human behavior as possible. Every aspect of what Google does has this goal tied to it. Self-driving cars not only give Google valuable information about where (and when) you go, but also gives you more time to interact with Google's products like Gmail and YouTube, similar to how Android and the iPhone have freed your computer from the shackles of the desktop. Look to the futureIt's wild speculation that Google will indeed be the most valuable company within the next three years. However, the vast seas of data that Google can access are just beginning to be tapped in any meaningful way. Barring a massive shift in consumers' tacit acceptance of this ""new normal"" around data sharing, the company's efforts to further tap into consumer behavior will only lead to more revenue. This is especially true as Google and its partners gain a better understanding of how this data can be used to influence consumers. Simply put, Google's path to continued growth looks clearer than Apple's or ExxonMobil's.

Why Lenovo Is Buying Google's Motorola Mobility,"Feb 4, 2014 at 12:00PM","In the past two weeks, Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY), the world's largest maker of personal computers, has acquired assets worth $5.2 billion. On Jan. 23, the company announced it was buying IBM's (NYSE:IBM) low-end server business. Only a week later, the company announced it will pay $2.9 billion for Google's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Motorola Mobility.Lenovo's recent acquisitions show the company's strong will to go beyond PCs and become an important player in the global market for smartphones and servers. However, Lenovo may have a hard time competing against mobile giants Samsung and Apple for market share in smartphones. Can Lenovo transform money-losing Motorola Mobility into a profit-generating business unit, and at the same time, turn around IBM's low-margin server business?SOURCE: LENOVO INVESTOR RELATIONSBeyond PCsIn the face of a shrinking PC industry, Lenovo knew that it would have to enter new markets in order to sustain revenue growth. That's why the company decided to manufacture smartphones, inspired by the massive success of Apple and Samsung. At the same time, Lenovo got interested in manufacturing and selling low-end servers as a way of entering the huge market for enterprise technology.Aiming to replicate its PC success in the smartphone world, the company adopted an aggressive pricing strategy, which -- combined with high quality standards in product design and manufacturing -- allowed Lenovo to quickly capture market share in emerging economies like China. This helped the company to become the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker, according to IDC Research.The missing pieceStill, Lenovo's market share for the fourth quarter of 2013 was only 4.9%, well below Samsung's 28.8% and Apple's 17.9%. Moreover, most of Lenovo's customers are concentrated in China.In this context, the company realized it had to accelerate its mobile plans by acquiring a mobile manufacturer with high exposure to western markets, like BlackBerry or Google's Motorola Mobility. Only such a move could allow Lenovo to quickly expand its smartphone sales beyond China, where it has been the second-largest smartphone player since 2012.Motorola Mobility was particularly attractive to Lenovo's management, due to the company's strong relationships with retailers and carriers in North America and Latin America. Further, by acquiring Motorola Mobility, Lenovo is getting access to more than 30 years of expertise in the mobile industry, robust research and development, and a portfolio of well-known products with strong brand awareness.In a way, the Motorola Mobility deal offered Lenovo similar capabilities and assets to what IBM offered the Chinese manufacturer back in 2004, when Big Blue sold its PC unit to Lenovo. Foolish takeawayLenovo is one of the most ambitious tech companies in the world. The company is adept at transforming older brands into revenue-generating machines -- which is how it became the world's biggest PC manufacturer after the IBM unit acquisition.Now, the company wants to use its tech expertise, aggressive pricing strategy, and high quality standards in manufacturing to win in the global smartphone market.From Google's point of view, the Motorola Mobility acquisition may be a blessing, as the company is getting rid of a division that loses money. Google now can devote more resources to Android. For Lenovo, there are plenty of risks, like the possibility of a corporate culture clash, dealing with low margins for several quarters, or the absence of an economic moat.That being said, investors should not underestimate Lenovo's ability to turn around businesses. After all, 10 years ago, nobody would have suspected Lenovo would end up becoming the world's biggest PC maker by transforming IBM's iconic ThinkPad brand into a revenue-generating machine, beating well-known competitors such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard."
The 2014 Dogs of the Dow,"Jan 2, 2014 at 4:34PM","The Dogs of the Dow is one of the simplest strategies to beat the market. In 2013, it beat the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) by 8.4% for a total return of 35%. Read on to find the names of 2014's Dogs of the Dow.The strategyDogs of the Dow is an investing strategy that buys and holds equal dollar amounts of the 10 highest-yielding dividend stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The strategy banks on the idea that blue-chip stocks with high yields are near the bottom of their business cycles and should do much better going forward. Investors in the strategy would then get not only large dividends, but also gains in the stocks underlying those dividends.High-yield dividendsHigh-yield portfolios are often dismissed as inferior to their growth counterparts. Many people fear that increasing dividend yields mean lower portfolio returns. Others think dividend payments mean management believes the business is done growing.Evidence compiled by Tweedy, Browne refutes these beliefs. Research shows that portfolios of high-yield dividend stocks outperform lower-yielding portfolios and the market in general. In fact, a study by Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel found that over 45 years, the highest-yielding 20% of S&P 500 stocks outperformed the S&P 500 by three times! The highest-yielding stocks turned a $1,000 investment in 1957 into $462,750 by 2002, compared with a final balance of $130,768 if the same money was invested in the index.PerformanceAfter beating the Dow by 6.8% in 2011, the Dogs of the Dow underperformed by 0.2% in 2012 but came roaring back with 8.37% outperformance in 2013.

IBM vs. Hewlett-Packard: Which Company Has the Better Plan?,"Oct 28, 2014 at 9:17AM","Both IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) are a part of old tech, with histories spanning multiple generations. Hewlett-Packard was founded in the depths of the Great Depression, bringing a sound-testing device to market in 1938. IBM, formerly the Computing Tabulating Recording Co., traces its roots back 60 years earlier, before the turn of the 20th century.Moving forward, you'll find two companies facing difficulties in this new tech paradigm. IBM reported lower revenue last fiscal year than in 2008, the height of the Great Recession. Hewlett-Packard also reported higher revenue in 2008 than it did last year. The two CEOs have taken different approaches to shareholder returns going forward, and investors need to ask which CEO has the better plan: IBM's Ginny Rometty or HP's Meg Whitman.IBM's high-margin focus combined with an aggressive share repurchase programFirst of all, it's pretty safe to assume that IBM's revenue growth will be hampered going forward as well. The issue isn't one of operations, but rather one of choice. Recently, IBM has been on a divestiture spree. It sold its x86 server business to Lenovo earlier this year and it announced that it was selling its chip business to Globalfoundries when reporting disappointing earnings earlier this week.In turn, IBM seeks to return value to shareholders through a combination of its generous capital return policy and a focus on higher-margin businesses. In an interview today, Rometty acknowledged IBM's poor performance but said the company is reinventing itself by focusing on data analysis and cloud computing. ""The strategy is correct,"" she said. ""Now it's our speed of execution that needs to improve.""One area where speed isn't a concern is IBM's capital return policy. The following chart will give you the proper context about IBM's cash moves over the past five full fiscal years:SOURCE: IBM'S 10-KS. ALL FIGURES ARE IN MILLIONS. LEFT Y-AXIS DENOTES DOLLAR FIGURES, AND RIGHT Y-AXIS IS SHARES OUTSTANDING.The company has engaged in a rather aggressive capital return policy. Since 2009, it has given back over $80 billion to shareholders, with $64 billion coming from share repurchases. The end result is a company that has reduced its shares outstanding by nearly 18%. And after the drop, IBM is valued at a price-to-earnings ratio of 10 and a dividend yield of 2.4%Hewlett-Packard goes a different routeHewlett-Packard has also engaged in buying back its stock, although not at the same scale as IBM. However, going forward, the company is looking to split the company's consumer-facing business into a company called HP and a business-oriented company named Hewlett-Packard Enterprises. The company expects that a spinoff will let each business be more nimble and will allow for the divestiture to ""unlock value"" (read: command higher valuation multiples). Right now, the company trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of 13 and a dividend yield of 2%.And it is possible, but these two sections face different threats: Hewlett-Packard's consumer-facing business is facing struggles in both its PC and printer businesses. And while a good part of that is weak hardware markets overall as PCs are being disrupted by tablets, HP is strongly affected by this trend. In Enterprise, Hewlett-Packard finds a better growth story in terms of macroeconomics, but intense competition from IBM, Dell, EMC, Microsoft, and Amazon.com.Final thoughtsWhile both companies seek to adjust to the new tech world, I think IBM is the stronger play. First, I think the argument about unlocking value isn't a strong one for long-term investors. Although spinoffs tend to outperform for the first three years after the divestiture, long-term fundamental investors need to consider intentions. Does the split improve the company fundamentally, or is a CEO reaching to compensate for lack of growth and no clear path forward operationally?Sadly, I think the latter is the case with HP. While Whitman has spoken ad nauseum of HP's turnaround, it still hasn't materialized yet. So right now, IBM is a higher-yielding investment that's cheaper on a price-to-earnings ratio after its post-earnings drop, with a plan to enrich shareholders.IBM's plan appears to be buying back shares and growing its margins, rather than revenue, to add value for shareholders. And while the company disappointed some shareholders by reneging on its wildly ambitious $20 EPS target by 2015, the company still lowered its shares outstanding by 18% in five years. In short, I like IBM's shot in the high-margin cloud space and enterprise moves with Apple more than I like Hewlett-Packard's enterprise and consumer chances."
HP's 3D Printing Technology: How Concerned Should Stratasys Ltd. (SSYS) Investors Be?,"Nov 9, 2014 at 1:00PM","If you're closely following the 3D printing space, you know that Hewlett-Packard Company's (NYSE:HPQ) much-anticipated entrance into the fast-growing 3D printing market arrived last week. The 2D printing king unveiled its new 3D printing technology called ""Multi Jet Fusion"" and the enterprise-focused 3D printer based upon this tech that it plans to bring to market in 2016. The printer is reportedly 10 times faster than those powered by the leading 3D printing technologies, while sporting high precision, high resolution, and brilliant color capabilities -- and it will be priced less than the competition.   How concerned should investors in industry leader Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) be? HP'S MULTI JET FUSION 3D PRINTER. SOURCE: HP.HP's 3D Printing TechnologyHP's Multi Jet Fusion tech is impressive. According to Computerworld, here's how Terry Wohlers, the 3D printing industry guru who runs the company that publishes the annual Wohlers Report, weighed in: HP's new 3D printer, if people see that and they're not blown away, then they don't understand what it takes to build parts using conventional manufacturing. It's not only a game changer, it's going to rewrite the rules in the 3D printing industry.HP's 3D printing technology builds upon the company's proprietary thermal inkjet printing tech that powers many of its 2D printers. There are key commonalities between the technologies, so it's perhaps not surprising that HP was able to leverage its 2D printing expertise to achieve such outstanding speed, resolution, precision, and color properties with its 3D printing tech. HP's proclamation that its printer is 10 times faster than competing technologies uses the leading 3D printing technologies in the United States as reference points: selective laser sintering, or SLS, (one of 3D Systems' technologies) and fused deposition modeling, or FDM, (one of Stratasys' core techs).How does HP's 3D printer achieve its industry-topping speed? By employing a unique feature -- a wide print bar with about 30,000 microscopic nozzles spraying 350 million drops per second of thermoplastic onto the print platform. The drops are 20 microns in size, which allows for extremely high resolution of about 1,200 dpi (dots per inch); most comparable printers have resolutions about half that. HP'S MULTI JET FUSION 3D PRINTER -- THE PRINT BAR IS SHOWN ON THE RIGHT. SOURCE: HP.HP showed off some examples demonstrating the fine detail and brilliant color capabilities of its printer. Here's a slick model of an oil rig: SOURCE: HP.Simplified, HP's tech can be thought of as a kind of binder jetting technology, with a touch of laser sintering tech thrown in. Like binder jetting, the process involves the application of a binding agent -- which HP calls a ""fusing agent"" -- to the materials that are being built up layer by layer. And like laser sintering, the process involves applying what HP calls an ""energy source"" to fuse the materials.As for materials, HP's printer will initially be able to print in a wide range of plastics. However, the company has said that it plans to expand the printer's capabilities to include ceramics and metals.I'm a bit skeptical that this tech will be able to successfully compete with direct metal laser sintering --the most widely used metal 3D printing tech -- and electron beam melting when it comes to printing metals. (Among the publically traded players, 3D Systems offers DMLS printers, while Arcam is the sole manufacturer of EBM printers.) Binder jetting generally isn't considered as effective as these technologies at producing high-density metal components. Very high densities are required for critical end-use applications, such as in the aerospace and medical implant industries. That said, HP is surely pouring money into research and development, so a competitive metal 3D printer is possible. Does Stratasys have anything to fear from HP?The short answer is ""Possibly down the road."" While HP has had well-publicized stumbles in the recent past, it shouldn't be underestimated. The company has deep pockets and already counts as customers many of the companies that it will likely be targeting with its 3D printer. So, it has the potential to offer compelling package deals and force margin squeezes on its smaller, pure-play 3D printing competitors. That said, there is still a huge difference between unveiling a compelling product and actually successfully bringing it to market. For this reason -- and the reasons I'll outline below -- investors in Stratasys should sit tight, as there is no reason for undue concern at this point.The 3D printing market is projected to explode in sizeAccording to the 2014 Wohlers Report, revenue for the industry grew year over year by 35% to $3.1 billion in 2013. Wohlers projects that the market will exceed $21 billion by 2020. That's a torrid annual growth rate of more than 31%. Other companies are predicting even faster growth.So, there's room at the 3D printing party for a new entrant, even a big player. HP's entrance could accelerate the industry's growth HP's entrance into the market could benefit Stratasys by helping increase the total size of the market. 3D printing is still in its early stages, especially for production applications. The entrance of a company of HP's size into the market should help increase awareness of the technology, which could speed up the market's already projected fast growth. Additionally, when a new formidable company enters a market, it forces existing players to up their innovation game. So, it's likely that the two leaders, Stratasys and 3D Systems, will ramp up their R&D spending. This could unleash even faster innovation in the space, which could lead to an acceleration in the growth of the market.HP's 3D printer launch is at least two years awayIt won't be until 2016 at the earliest that HP launches its printer. One-and-a-half to two years is an eternity in the tech world. Stratasys' product offerings won't remain static during this period. The company has maintained a steady R&D budget in the 10%-11% of revenue range, which has enabled it to continue to improve its technology and roll out new products.Stratasys' largely R&D-driven organic growth is a key reason that it should be effective at fending off competition from HP and other new entrants into the market. While competitor 3D Systems has a few advantages in its moat bag of tricks that Stratasys does not -- namely its greater diversity of technologies, its metal printer offerings, and its Project Ara partnership with Google to develop a high-speed, continuous, fabrication-grade platform -- the fact that its growth has largely been acquisition-driven could make it more vulnerable than Stratasys over the long term, in my opinion.Stratasys is diversifiedStratasys' revenue breakdown by segment for Q2:Segment Percentage of Total Revenue Product, excluding MakerBot* 67.5%MakerBot 18.8%Services 13.7%*INCLUDES SALES OF PRINTERS AND MATERIALS. SOURCE: STRATASYS Q2 EARNINGS REPORT.Stratasys closed on its acquisitions of Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies, both of which provide on-demand 3D printing services, in the second quarter. So, its services percentage of revenue will almost surely increase in the near term. Stratasys has three 3D printing technologies upon which its 3D printers are based:Fused deposition modeling, or FDMPolyJetWax deposition modeling, or WDMWhich technologies and business segments might be most vulnerable to competition from HP's printer?Stratasys' proprietary PolyJet technology is the most similar to HP's tech. It jets layers of UV-curable liquid photopolymer onto a build tray. Its key strengths are its ability to produce complex shapes, intricate details, and smooth surfaces.However, there are at least three factors that should help mitigate HP's competitive threat here:Two analysts have opined that HP's tech appears more similar to 3D Systems' multijet modeling technology than to Stratasys' PolyJet tech. If this proves accurate, it's not Stratasys that has the lowest-hanging fruit.Stratasys' PolyJet line is heavily geared toward advanced prototyping, rather than production. It seems that HP's printer will be aimed at production applications. Stratasys' Objet Connex500 Connex printers -- a high-end line that's been selling well -- sport 16-micron resolution versus HP's printer's 20-micron resolution. Stratasys' Fortus 3D printers, which are powered by FDM tech, could also be vulnerable. These printers are primarily targeted to production applications, so HP's printer's speed advantage should put it in play as a competitor for some applications.  In addition to targeting enterprise customers, HP will surely be marketing its 3D printer to on-demand 3D printing service operations, which could present competition to Stratasys' services segment. Last fall, HP CEO Meg Whitman implied such when she was quoted by the The Register as saying: ""[We're asking] how do we commercialise to print faster, at lower price points, to enable service providers?"" In fact, Shapeways CEO Peter Weijmarshausen joined HP execs on the stage last week to share his accolades of the printer. Shapeways is the Amazon.com of the 3D printing space, providing 3D printing services for consumers through to larger businesses, with a focus on consumers and small businesses.  Which products appear safe from competition from HP? The company's desktop models should be safe, as HP's initial offering is intended for a factory floor. Stratasys' well-known MakerBot printers fall into this category, as do its uPrint and Mojo printers. These latter printers, which are based on FDM tech, are commercial-grade machines targeted to enterprise customers. Additionally, Stratasys' WDM 3D printers shouldn't be affected by HP's entrance into the market. These printers build waxlike castings for the dental market. Stratasys doesn't break out its printer sales by product line, but it's a big player in the dental market. Bottom lineNo matter how compelling HP's 3D printing technology is, it's highly unlikely that one technology is ever going to be the best fit for all -- or even most -- applications and materials. Furthermore, since the 3D printing market is projected to explode in size and Stratasys has proven that it can both innovate and execute well, its future still looks bright at this point.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Should HP Spend $5.7 Billion on Share Buybacks?,"Oct 1, 2014 at 4:15PM","Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) has a history of destroying a tremendous amount of shareholder value through poorly timed share buybacks. From fiscal 2009-2011, HP spent a total of $26.3 billion repurchasing its own shares, taking on debt in order to finance the transactions. The stock is now well below the peak levels of those years, and CEO Meg Whitman, who ascended to that position toward the end of 2011, has since drastically reduced the buyback activity of the company.HP has spent about $2.5 billion on share buybacks over the past 12 months, and the company has $5.7 billion remaining in its previous stock repurchase authorization. While HP will likely continue buying back its own shares, the company should instead consider raising the dividend significantly, scrapping the remaining $5.7 billion buyback authorization entirely.The problem with HP's buyback programHP has plenty of capital available for share buybacks, but simply having the ability to buy back shares doesn't make it a good idea. A company should only buy back its own shares when the stock is materially undervalued, and while HP may appear inexpensive based on current earnings, I'm not confident that the company can grow, or even maintain, those earnings in the long term.The two largest components of HP's profits are the printing group, which is composed of printers and printing supplies, and the enterprise group, which consists of enterprise hardware like servers, as well as technology services. Combined, these two segments accounted for $8.2 billion of non-GAAP operating income in fiscal 2013, compared to $2.9 billion generated by the rest of the company.HP's printing business is a cash cow, albeit one in decline. Revenue has been falling for quite some time, but HP has managed to keep operating margins in the high teens. The enterprise group has also been in decline, although HP did manage to boost revenue by 2% year over year in the most recent quarter. The real problem, though, is that the enterprise group's operating margin has been continually declining for the past two years. And with the Lenovo-IBM deal finally set to close, HP could be facing a very aggressive competitor in the enterprise hardware market.HP generated $8.4 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2014, putting the current market capitalization at a little more than eight times this number. Share buybacks may seem like a no-brainer at this valuation, but if the free cash flow contracts over time, a reasonable assumption given where the bulk of it is generated, then the stock isn't nearly as cheap as it appears.The dividend should be raisedThe best thing that HP can do for investors is raise its dividend. The stock currently yields about 1.8%, and HP will pay out just $0.64 per share in dividends over the next year. That's only $1.2 billion, or 14.3% of the free cash flow.HP can afford to significantly raise the dividend, bringing it up to the levels of other large tech companies. Historically, HP has heavily favored buybacks, keeping the dividend flat from 1998 all the way through the beginning of 2011, all the while reducing the share count with buybacks. This policy hasn't done much for investors.HPQ DATA BY YCHARTSEven if HP's earnings decline, the dividend currently accounts for such a small portion of profits that it shouldn't cause any problems. A 50% dividend increase would lead to $1.8 billion in payouts each year, so even a massive 50% collapse in HP's free cash flow would still give the dividend plenty of breathing room.Before any more money is spent on share buybacks, HP should raise its dividend to make it comparable to other big tech companies like Microsoft and Intel, which are currently both yielding 2.6%. HP's share buyback record is abysmal, buying when the stock is high and cutting back when the stock falls, and the company should instead give that money directly to shareholders in the form of dividends. The average investor could almost certainly do a better job than HP has done allocating that capital. "
"Why Lenovo Continues Crushing HP, Dell, and Apple in the PC Market","Oct 14, 2014 at 5:30PM","Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY) widened its lead over rivals Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Dell, Acer, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the PC market during the third quarter of 2014, according to research firm IDC.Lenovo, which evolved into a personal computer giant after acquiring IBM's (NYSE:IBM) PC business a decade ago, now controls a fifth of the world's PC market. Rivals HP, Dell, and Apple also posted market share gains, while Acer's market share plunged by over 11%.QuarterLenovoHPDellAcerAppleOthers3Q 201317.7%17.5%11.9%8.4%5.7%39.7%3Q 201420%18.8%13.3%7.4%6.3%33.1%GLOBAL PC MARKET SHARES. SOURCE: IDC.What's impressive about Lenovo's 11% market share gain is that it was accomplished as global PC shipments declined 1.7% year over year during the quarter. So why has Lenovo been so successful while other PC makers have blamed the rise of tablets for their misfortunes?Know how to diversify geographicallyIn fiscal 2014, just 38% of Lenovo's revenue came from China, its home market; 25% came from Europe and the Middle East and 21% came from the Americas. Lenovo's dependence on China, where it faces cheaper domestic competitors, has decreased dramatically over the years (down from 60% to 70%), and it now mainly relies on foreign markets for growth.HP faces the same situation. Last year, 64% of the company's top line came from outside the U.S. But as Lenovo strategically decreased its dependence on China, HP expanded there in hopes that it would offset stagnant growth in the U.S.The decline of China's PC market can clearly be seen in Western tech companies. Cisco recently warned of declining Chinese demand, while IBM reported a sales decline of over 20% in Chinese revenue. That's bad news for HP, which relies on China for roughly 20% of its top line. Therefore, If Lenovo is retreating from the Chinese market, it would be wise for HP to do the same.Don't stop believing in laptopsLenovo reacted calmly to the rise of tablets that started with the debut of Apple's iPad in 2010. Despite dire predictions that tablets would eventually kill the laptop market, Lenovo pumped out new laptops, released Android tablets and smartphones to offset possible losses in the PC segment, and gradually modified its Windows laptops into convertible forms.Today, those businesses are clearly defined -- Lenovo's Yoga laptops are easily recognizable with their foldable ""tent"" form factor, its Yoga tablets continue to surprise customers with innovations such as built-in projectors and subwoofers, and its phone business will get a lot bigger when the acquisition of Motorola Mobility from Google closes next year.LENOVO YOGA 3 PRO. SOURCE: LENOVO.Although Lenovo remained in firm control of the PC market in the third quarter, it steadily decreased its dependence on desktops and laptops while increasing its dependence on mobile devices:  LaptopsDesktopsMobileOthers201353%31%9%7%201451%28%15%6%PERCENTAGE OF ANNUAL REVENUE. SOURCE: LENOVO ANNUAL REPORT.Don't overreact to a technological shiftHP, by comparison, overreacted to the arrival of the iPad with a series of painful blunders. In July 2011, the company launched the TouchPad, a $500-$600 webOS tablet that lasted for a single month before being discontinued and sold in a humiliating ""fire sale"" for $99. That same month, HP stunned investors by mulling a spinoff of its PC business.HP'S TOUCHPAD. SOURCE: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS.The company then abruptly acquired enterprise software company Autonomy for a whopping $10.3 billion to decrease its dependence on the PC business -- which turned out to be its worst acquisition in recent history. Those errors led to the replacement of CEO Leo Apotheker, who had been on the job for less than a year, with former eBay CEO Meg Whitman. Dell followed in HP's footsteps: After launching a series of unpopular consumer-facing devices over the past decade, the company became an IT company in 2012. A year later, founder Michael Dell took the company private.Overreacting during a critical technological shift not only cost HP and Dell the PC market, but they also missed the opportunity to capture a meaningful share of the mobile space. In the end, HP's absurd anti-PC reaction was unjustified and enabled Lenovo to dethrone it as the world's top PC company. Gartner now predicts that shipments of traditional PCs (desktops and laptops) will decline 5% between 2014 and 2015 -- hardly a decline heralding the end of the PC industry.The Foolish takeawayIn addition to being the largest PC maker in the world, Lenovo is now also the second-largest PC/tablet maker and the third-largest smartphone supplier. PCs are still clearly its core competency, but it will eventually rely on three key pillars of growth: PCs, mobile devices, and enterprise solutions, thanks to its acquisition of IBM's low-end server business.Lenovo has become a force to be reckoned with thanks to its disciplined approach to geographic expansion, its slow and steady approach to diversifying its businesses, and a natural evolution of form factors for its products that keeps customers interested in its products.10 stocks we like better than LENOVO GROUP LTD.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is HP About to Make Another Disastrous Acquisition?,"Sep 29, 2014 at 10:30AM","In recent years, technology giant Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) has had a pretty consistent record when it comes to M&A activity. Its biggest acquisitions have almost all been disasters.Despite this terrible track record, HP may be looking to get back into the megamerger game. Reports have surfaced twice in the last few months that HP was on the verge of signing a big M&A deal: first with Rackspace, and now with EMC (NYSE:EMC).Shareholders should hope that these reports have exaggerated HP's interest. Investors will probably be better off if HP continues executing its current strategy rather than attempting another big acquisition.A history of failureSince the year 2000, HP has made 3 huge M&A deals, valued at more than $10 billion each -- as well as a slew of smaller deals. None of the biggest deals have been remotely successful.HP'S $25 BILLION ACQUISITION OF COMPAQ DIDN'T WORK OUT IN THE LONG RUN (PHOTO: THE MOTLEY FOOL)First, HP acquired rival PC-maker Compaq in 2001 in a $25 billion all-stock deal. Nearly 6 years later, the deal looked like it might be a success. However, the PC industry has never recovered from the Great Recession, and that was Compaq's biggest line of business. In 2012, HP wrote down the value of the Compaq acquisition by $1.2 billion.Next, HP spent nearly $14 billion to acquire IT services giant EDS in 2008. However, EDS turned out to be a bloated organization and faced rising low-cost competition. HP wrote down the value of that acquisition by more than 50% -- about $8 billion -- in 2012.HP's folly peaked in 2011, when it acquired British software firm Autonomy for $11 billion. This time, it took HP just a year to write the deal down by a stunning $8.8 billion. HP is now embroiled in litigation with Autonomy's former leaders, alleging that they had cooked the books to inflate Autonomy's revenue and gross margin.Considering HP's propensity to swing for the fences and miss, shareholders were relieved when new CEO Meg Whitman began preaching a no-big-acquisitions policy a few years ago. As recently as last summer, Whitman stated that HP was not interested in acquisitions with a price tag of more than $1.5 billion. However, the winds may be changing.Looking to buy?HP MAY BE GETTING BACK INTO THE MARKET FOR BIG ACQUISITIONS (PHOTO: THE MOTLEY FOOL)This spring, Rackspace -- one of the largest cloud-computing pure-play firms -- announced that it was considering ""strategic alternatives."" (That's banking industry jargon for looking into M&A possibilities.) HP was frequently mentioned as a possible suitor in press reports.While HP never officially confirmed its interest in Rackspace, CFO Cathie Lesjak stated in August that HP had not bought back many shares in the prior quarter due to ""material non-public information."" That's a clear indication that HP was considering a big M&A move, although nothing came of it.Rackspace is a big player in cloud services: an area where HP wants to grow. However, Rackspace faces withering competition from Amazon.com. Moreover, while its market cap is currently about $4.5 billion, it was valued at more than $7 billion in late 2013, and HP probably would have had to pay at least that much to close a deal.RAX MARKET CAP DATA BY YCHARTSCompared to the size of a potential deal with EMC, $7 billion looks cheap. EMC is currently valued at about $60 billion -- just a tad less than HP. An HP-EMC tie-up would thus be a merger of equals. In fact, it's possible that shareholders of each company would have held exactly half of the combined company's stock if recent discussions between HP and EMC had led to a merger.That wouldn't be good news for HP investors. HP stock trades for just 9 times forward earnings, whereas EMC shares trade for 14 times forward earnings. The valuation gap would be even higher in the case of a 50/50 ownership split. This means that EMC investors would see an immediate jump in EPS, while HP shareholders would face a drop in EPS.For HP shareholders to do well in a merger with EMC, the combined company would need to find billions of dollars of synergies. Based on HP's acquisition track record -- lots of lemons and not much lemonade -- a successful integration might be too much to hope for.Stay the courseThe ironic thing is that HP has plenty of tools to drive profit growth without resorting to a megamerger. HP shares trade for less than 8 times free cash flow, so the company can grow EPS simply by directing that cash toward share buybacks.Additionally, HP's services business, which represents more than $20 billion of annual revenue, posted a 2.5% pre-tax margin through the first 3 quarters of FY14. However, HP believes this business can sustainably earn 7%-9% pre-tax margins, which would represent roughly $1 billion in incremental profit. The services division is therefore the primary target of HP's massive cost-cutting program.HP's best bet is to keep working on its turnaround by nurturing its growth businesses and new products under development, while returning excess cash to shareholders. If HP executives see small acquisition opportunities, they should pursue those deals. But if the only deals available are megamergers, HP investors should pray that the company shuns them.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The HP 3D Printer: What Does It Mean for 3D Printing Stocks?,"Nov 4, 2014 at 1:00PM","The 800-pound gorilla has awoken: Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) will enter the 3D printing market in 2016, armed with a homegrown 3D printing technology for the industrial segment that it's calling Multi Jet Fusion. 3D printing stocks initially sold off on the news.SOURCE: HP.Multi Jet Fusion leverages HP's decades of 2D printing expertise with manipulating different types of droplets precisely, accurately, and quickly. HP believes this competency ""gives HP Multi Jet Fusion technology a versatility and potential not found in other 3D printing technologies."" Terry Wohlers, President of 3D printing industry insights firm Wohlers Associates, shared a similar sentiment:SOURCE: HP.How Multi Jet Fusion worksOn a high level, Multi Jet Fusion is a layer-by-layer manufacturing process that uses an HP thermal inkjet carriage to lay down a series of fusing and detailing chemical agents over a layer of powder. A second carriage then makes a pass, hits the chemical agents with an energy source to fuse the layer to the previous layer, and also deposits a fresh layer of powder to repeat the process.MULTI JET FUSION FROM ABOVE. SOURCE: HP.Here's a cross-section of HP's Multi Jet Fusion 3D printing process:SOURCE: HP.Multi Jet Fusion can simultaneously utilize up to 10,000 inkjet nozzles, capable of printing over 30 million drops per second across each inch of the build area, with a five-micron tolerance. In practical terms, HP claims its use of inkjet nozzles makes Multi Jet Fusion up to 10 times faster than leading selective laser sintering and extrusion-based 3D printers -- which are limited by the fact that they rely on the need for focused energy at a single point. As you can see in the video below, Multi Jet Fusion doesn't appear to sacrifice strength or quality at the expense of speed.SOURCE: HP.The grand visionLonger term, HP envisions Multi Fusion Technology becoming a dynamic 3D printing platform that takes advantage of materials beyond thermal plastics and makes use of new chemical agents that allow products to be manufactured like never before. The ability to modify color, elasticity, texture, strength, detail, and electrical and thermal conductivity -- within a single 3D-printed part -- at the voxel (3D pixel) level -- are all within the realm of what's possible with Multi Jet Fusion. HP is currently investigating whether the technology will be well suited for 3D printing with ceramics and metals, and has also invited select customers to help accelerate its development.In other words, there are potentially many expansion opportunities for Multi Jet Fusion to grow into a highly dynamic 3D printing platform, whereby a single 3D printer can fluidly handle a diverse range of materials, which would be unlike any other 3D printing technology that exists today. Leading 3D printing technologies like material extrusion and selective laser sintering are often only suited for a handful of materials, and switching between materials in a single machine isn't practical or efficient from an operational standpoint. In fact, 3D printing service bureau Sculpteo tends to purchase new 3D printers when it brings new materials online.3D PRINTED PARTS FROM HP.  SOURCE: HP.What it means for 3D printing stocksAlthough HP hasn't set a price for its upcoming 3D printer, it's expected to cost on the lower end of the $150,000-$500,000 range that industrial 3D printers typically cost. As a near-term value proposition, HP's Multi Jet Fusion technology is addressing one of the biggest drawbacks of 3D printing: It's slow as molasses.From this perspective, it's almost a no-brainer for 3D printing service bureaus to invest in HP's 3D printer, because it'll help the bureau's customers bring products to market faster by further accelerating the product design process. Additionally, if HP can deliver on some of the future possibilities that Multi Jet Fusion offers, it may even help drive 3D printing adoption to new heights, especially in areas around finished goods manufacturing.While HP entering the 3D printing market adds legitimacy to the industry and may provide a benefit to 3D Systems Corporation and Stratasys, Ltd., I think 3D printing investors shouldn't discount being in direct competition with HP, which could prove to be a risky endeavor. After all, HP has more than four times the cash that the worldwide 3D printing industry generated in revenues last year.Although it's possible that HP's competitors will introduce 3D printers that offer a similar value proposition to HP's Multi Jet Fusion, it's still too early to tell how HP's entrance may reshape the industry and what kind of impact it may have on 3D printing stocks. No matter what the future holds, investors should consider watching product revenues from 3D printing stocks in the quarters ahead of HP's official debut, because it may provide early indications about the kind of influence the tech giant may have on the industry.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Fortune 500: The Gold Standard of American Business Success?,"Nov 6, 2014 at 11:03AM","The Fortune 500 is advertised this year as ""The Gold Standard of Business Success."" The list consists of the top 500 publicly-traded companies by revenue. While revenue is important, it should never be the gauge of success for a business or management team. You would never point to a morbidly obese person as the gold standard of healthy living, but this essentially is what the Fortune 500 does. The most important questions in business are how much value is created for others and how well are resources being used. Making revenue the be-all and end-all promotes bad behavior for CEOs, management teams, and boards. There is a better way.SOURCE: FORTUNE.We tend to glorify the largest companies and their management teams, Fortune magazine calls the companies on the Fortune 500 ""winners ."" However, their size says nothing about their health. Enron (No. 5 in 2002), WorldCom (No. 25 in 2000), Fannie Mae (No. 25 in 2003), and General Motors (No. 3 in 2007) all reached the top 25 of the Fortune 500 before failing spectacularly.Management teams inherently have an incentive to grow their company's size, if executives' compensation is highly correlated to the size of the company. This is regardless of whether they are creating value for shareholders or destroying value for shareholders.The Fortune 500 also encourages empire building: the pursuit of growth to increase an organization's size, power, and influence with no regards to whether it is beneficial for shareholders (the owners of the company). Companies move up the Fortune 500 by growing the business and making acquisitions. You move down the list if your revenue compared to others falls.When CEOs say things like ""Our goal is to be a Fortune 500 company,"" or ""We're not just some cheap Chinese company making a cheap phone, we're going to be a Fortune 500 company,"" or ""Eventually, we're going to be a Fortune 100 company,"" be aware. Those could be the signs of an empire builder.SOURCE: FORTUNEEmpire builders on the Fortune 500A great example is provided by Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and General Electric (NYSE:GE) in 2006. At the time these companies were respectively the No. 24 and No. 7 companies on the Fortune 500. Fortune interviewed the companies' CEOs, and the interviewer noted, ""the same big idea motivates virtually everything they do-another mantra easy to say but hard to execute: organic growth.""The U.S. economy was growing at about 3% annually at the time. A.G. Lafley, the CEO of Procter & Gamble, had declared a goal of 4%-6% annual organic growth. This just after his company had completed a $57 billion acquisition of Gillette. Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of General Electric, declared a goal of 8% organic growth. So while these men were leading the 24th and seventh-largest companies in the U.S., they aimed to grow those businesses two to three times faster than the U.S. economy.To give some idea of the absurdity of this, the interviewer noted,To meet P&G's growth targets, Lafley has to find about $7 billion of new revenue this year, equivalent to a company the size of Barry Diller's IAC/Interactive. At GE, Immelt has to find about $15 billion of new revenue, equal to the size of Nike. And if they succeed, of course, they'll have to turn around and find even more next year.How did it turn out? Procter & Gamble shareholders would have done just as well putting their money in an index fund, while GE investors would have done far better in an index fund.SPY DATA BY YCHARTS.The Dearly DepartedThe Fortune 500 also offers disincentive for companies to get smaller as they drop down the list.

This comes even as companies that have become smaller and more focused are truly in a better place than when they were overweight with multiple different types of businesses.A great example is actually Fortune Brands, which is not to be confused with Fortune magazine. Fortune Brands was a diversified holding company that operated businesses focused on home furnishings (Moen faucets, Simonton windows), golf products (Titleist), and liquor (Jim Beam). In 2011, Fortune Brands separated its three businesses into separate companies. Fortune Brands' golf business was bought out, but the remaining two businesses became Beam and Fortune Brands Home & Security (NYSE:FBHS). What was the result?SOURCE: GOOGLE FINANCE.While the businesses became smaller and no longer were on the Fortune 500, results at both Beam and Fortune Brands Home & Security improved. Beam was acquired in January 2014 by Suntory and Fortune Brands & Home Security continues to do well. Thankfully, some management teams get this. In recent months, Hewlett-Packard, eBay, and Symantec have all announced plans to split up their various businesses to make them stronger.The gold standard of American business successHistorically, the gold standard was how much gold a dollar could be exchanged for, making gold the benchmark for the value of a dollar. The gold standard of American business success thus implies that these companies are the benchmark for corporate success. However, the benchmark should be outstanding performance rather than size.The Motley Fool believes the best companies in America are those that best use their resources over time to build sustainable value for all constituents: customers, employees, investors, and the world. While the value to certain stakeholders can be somewhat hard to measure, there are two critical, and clear, yardsticks for the investor:1. Owner earnings, aka free cash flowOwner earnings answers the question of ""how much value is the business creating for its owners?"" That is how much cash flow the business generates for its owners after accounting for all capital expenditures required to maintain its long-term competitive position.2. Sustained return on invested capital over timeReturn on invested capital answers the question of ""is the business a steward of the money invested by owners? That is, how much owner capital did it take to earn that cash?"" If a business earned $10 million but used $1 billion to earn it, that's not anywhere near as impressive as if a business used only $40 to earn that $10 million. It's also important that returns are sustainable. As business guru Jim Collins said:In sports, your team has to win championships, or it really can't be called a great team. In business, the measure is financial -- return on invested capital. I think that, to be considered great, a company must have sustained returns on invested capital substantially in excess of other companies in its industry.Value Investor 500By taking the top 500 companies in the U.S. by free cash flow, and then ranking them by their five-year average return on invested capital, I came up with a qualitative list of the 500 companies in the U.S., which I call the Value Investor 500.The Value Investor 500 is certainly far from perfect, but it is far closer to a gold standard of American business success than the Fortune 500. Among the top 25 companies on the Value Investor 500, you'll find some companies you would expect (Apple, Microsoft, MasterCard), as well as some names that might surprise you.American business successWarren Buffett could easily be called the gold standard of American business success. Buffett went from humble beginnings to being one of the richest people in the world. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, has been slowly climbing the Fortune 500 for nearly 60 years. Berkshire first made the Fortune 500 in 1956 at No. 431 after the merger of two textile companies, Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates and Hathaway Manufacturing. The companies merged in an effort to survive the declining U.S. textile market in the northeastern U.S..Buffett bought Berkshire in the 1960s after it hit hard times and fell off the list. Buffett grew the business through investing, and in 1989 the company reemerged on the Fortune 500 at No. 205. Berkshire is No. 4 on the list for 2014.Why do I bring this up? The old management of Berkshire Hathaway thought the solution to the company's business problems was to merge, grow larger, and gain economies of scale in a declining business. After entering the Fortune 500 at No. 431, Berkshire Hathaway's ranking declined annually for the next three years before the company fell off the list in 1960.Buffett, on the other hand, built up Berkshire Hathaway by following the same principles of the Value Investing 500. He invested in businesses with long-term competitive advantages that produce sustainable earnings for their owners and allow for high returns on invested capital. If that method is good for one of the best investors in the world, consider it for yourself."
Good Thing This Tech Company is The Most Trustworthy -- It Knows All Your Secrets,"Oct 19, 2014 at 8:31AM","SOURCE: THETAXHAVEN VIA FLICKR.Trust is the foundation to which all businesses are built upon. Whether we're talking about a retailer, a biotechnology company, or a smartphone producer, no company can thrive without earning the trust of its customers.Of course, earning that trust can be difficult, especially nowadays when trust isn't easily given by the consumer. Within the past couple of years we've witnessed numerous letdowns of consumer trust, from credit card network breaches at Target, JPMorgan Chase, and most recently Home Depot, to book-cooking scandals that plagued more than a dozen Chinese small-cap stocks in 2011. Companies today need to be able to convey to consumers that they not only can deliver a premium product and are concerned about the environment and other key social issues, but that they can also protect their data.Measuring trustworthiness in the tech sectorFew sectors deal with this challenge more regularly than the technology sector which is essentially the heart and soul of data protection and which provides the backbone for most businesses: their IT infrastructure.Within this list you'll find plenty of predictable tech brands within the top 25. Canon at the No. 23 spot, Sony at No. 22, IBM at No. 20, Hewlett-Packard at No. 18, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at No. 11.Yet, measuring a company or its brands' trustworthiness isn't always easy, especially in the tech sector where we don't often think about tech companies as a brand. In order to get a better feel for what tech brands are most trustworthy I turned to Forbes, which recently listed the 100 most trustworthy brands (all sectors included).Take Microsoft as a great example in the 11 spot. While Microsoft may not be well-liked if you're a Mac user or prefer the Linux operating system, you can't argue against Microsoft's ability to produce consistent profits for shareholders on the heels of its still-dominant Windows operating system. When it comes to the potential for accounting issues, the potential for bankruptcy, or a material event really weakening Microsoft, these factors all rank extremely low thanks to its $61.7 billion in net cash and more than $32 billion in operating cash flow over the past four quarters. Microsoft is nearly as steady as they come, and thus a high-ranking company on Forbes' list of most trustworthy brands.Can you guess tech's most trustworthy brand?Still, Microsoft didn't even crack the top 10. In fact, two tech companies ranked even higher than Microsoft. Would you care to place your guess which one ranked highest on the list?SOURCE: APPLE.If you said Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) you've astutely and correctly picked one of the two tech companies ranked higher than Microsoft, but you didn't choose the top-ranking tech brand for trustworthiness. According to Forbes, the one factor that appeared to hold Apple, arguably one of the most cutting-edge innovative brands with the iPhone, iPad, and now iWatch and Apple Pay, back was its weak rankings when it comes to environmental sustainability. Somehow I personally doubt that'll slow the almost cult-like following for Apple, which manifested in more than 10 million iPhone 6 sales during the first weekend of its release (another new record), but it was enough to pull Apple below the top spot for trustworthiness in tech.Why Google takes the crownIf, however, you said Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), then to quote the knight guarding the holy grail in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, ""You have chosen ... wisely!""Should Google really come as that much of a surprise? Probably not considering it has an absolute lion's share of the search market. According to comScore, which tracks search engine rankings on a monthly basis, Google retained 67.3% of all search queries in August 2014, compared to 19.4% for Microsoft's Bing, 10% even for Yahoo!, and 3.3% split between two other search engines. Consumers flock to brands they trust, and this huge search gap is an indication that Google is the trusted search source for Internet users.But, Google is now so much more than just a search company. Google is an even more dominant beast when it comes to global operating system market share for smartphones based on figures from IDC. Per IDC's second-quarter statistics, Google's Android OS comprised 84.7% of all smartphone OS', well ahead of Apple's iOS at 11.7%. To add further context to Google's smartphone OS dominance, in Q2 2011 its market share at the time was a mere 36.1%.Google also owns popular video site YouTube and runs social media site Google+ which had more than 300 million monthly active users as of a year ago. Long story short, Google has no trouble attracting and hanging onto consumers because it gives its customers little reason to worry. Google is well financed with $50 billion in net cash and slightly more than $20 billion in operating cash flow generation over the previous 12-month period. Furthermore, because it's the dominant force in search and smartphone OS it would be unlikely to find its business model in jeopardy anytime soon, which makes it a potentially strong investment candidate.Additionally, Google is a champion of going green. According to its Google Green initiative, the company notes that its data center servers use 50% less energy than most other data centers, and that 35% of its overall energy consumption now comes from renewable sources. Conveying a genuine interest in the environment is a good way to keep consumers happy and help deliver on the aforementioned trust factor.""Will Google be able to hang onto its crown,"" you wonder? While I don't have a crystal ball, I'd certainly suggest it's not likely to lose its high-ranking anytime soon. Though Apple may still have more of a cult-like following, as well as a monstrous net cash position, it lacks the Internet-based dominance on a global basis that Google can provide.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

HP SlateBook 14 Shows Why Android Laptops Are a Bad Idea,"Sep 6, 2014 at 9:08AM","About a month ago, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) began shipping a 14-inch Android laptop, the SlateBook 14. This isn't HP's first foray into putting Android on form factors typically reserved for Windows; last year the company launched the SlateBook x2, an Android-powered detachable laptop. While the x2 received mediocre reviews, the product made at least some sense given that it could be used as a stand-alone tablet, a form factor for which Android is designed.THE SLATEBOOK 14. SOURCE: HPThe SlateBook 14, however, makes very little sense, especially given the Chrome OS and Windows alternatives on the market. Reviews have been overwhelmingly negative, and HP's Android laptop experiment highlights a key challenge facing all PC manufacturers today.Why an Android laptop is a bad ideaThe following quotes, from reviews of the SlateBook 14, sum up why putting Android on a laptop doesn't make much sense:The SlateBook takes Android, an otherwise intuitive operating system, and manages to make it... cumbersome. It's a pain to use with a mouse, and yet if you want to use your fingers, you have to reach across the keyboard. ... Frankly, I'm not sure I'd recommend an Android laptop at any price, but for $430 the answer's easy: Just don't do it. -- Dana Wollman at engadget.com  With the increasingly popularity of Chromebooks, as well as inexpensive Windows notebooks, why do we need or want a laptop running a mobile OS when there are cheaper, more efficient devices already on the market? Answer: You don't. ... Just because you can cram Android into a laptop doesn't mean you should. The OS is ill-suited to basic notebook functions. -- Sherri L. Smith at LaptopMag.com Android simply wasn't designed to be used with a mouse and keyboard, and shoving it into a laptop form factor is a recipe for frustration. The cost is also a big problem. HP is charging $430 for the SlateBook 14, while both Chromebooks and Windows laptops can be purchased for far less:DeviceOSPriceHP SlateBook 14Android$429.99Dell Inspiron 3531-1200BKWindows 8.1$249.99Acer C720Chrome OS$199.99SOURCE: AMAZON Android is an operating system designed for consumption. It works well on phones and tablets, and it will likely work well on TVs and smart watches as well. It does not work well on devices designed for creation, like laptops. Windows and Chrome OS are built for those use cases, and any familiarity a user may have with Android is more than offset by the inefficiencies created by putting the OS on a laptop.The post-post-PC eraBefore the tablet market exploded, there was very little innovation in the PC market. The laptop form factor remained essentially unchanged for years, and HP managed to grow to be the largest PC manufacturer in the world, holding that title from 2007 through 2012.PC unit growth stalled in 2012, and global unit sales fell by about 10% in 2013, the first negative year for the industry since 2001. Meanwhile, the tablet market was booming, with unit sales rising by 68% in 2013. Some began proclaiming that we were entering a ""post-PC"" era, where mobile devices along with the cloud would render the traditional PC obsolete. But with tablet sales now plateauing in mature markets, it's clear that the PC isn't going anywhere.The challenge for PC manufacturers is determining what consumers and businesses want. Along with traditional desktops and laptops, there are now tablets and various forms of 2-in-1 devices. And instead of Windows being the only option, there is now Chrome OS and Android. The key for companies like HP is figuring out the right combination.ASUS T100 TRANSFORMER BOOK. SOURCE: ASUSOther PC companies seem to have a better grasp on what consumers want. Asus launched the T100 Transformer Book last year, a 10-inch Windows 8 detachable device that sells for around $400, and it's been one of the top selling laptops on Amazon.com since its release. Asus also sells Android detachables, but these don't appear to be selling nearly as well.LENOVO'S YOGA 2 LAPTOP. SOURCE: LENOVOLenovo has also been successful with 2-in-1 devices. Its Yoga line of Windows laptops that allow the screen to be folded back and used as a tablet were the best-selling 2-in-1 devices during the first part of this year, according to NPD. Lenovo attempted an Android 2-in-1 device last year, the IdeaTab S2110, but it no longer offers it for sale.There aren't very many Android 2-in-1 devices for a reason -- it's a combination that offers a good tablet experience and a poor laptop experience, something that doesn't seem very appealing in light of the alternatives. An Android laptop removes the good tablet experience entirely, leaving only a lackluster laptop that's not well-suited for productivity.HP is still the largest PC vendor in the United States, accounting for around 28% of the market, but maintaining that lead is going to require innovative devices that consumers actually want. The SlateBook 14 is not one of those devices, and with Lenovo, which is now the largest PC vendor worldwide, occupying the No. 3 spot in the U.S. (with 11.5% of the U.S. market) and growing sales faster than any other company in the top five, HP's dominance in the U.S could be in jeopardy. (Dell is No. 2 on the U.S. list with 26% of the market.)The bottom lineAndroid is ill-suited for a laptop, but HP apparently hasn't gotten the memo. The SlateBook 14 makes no sense in a vacuum, let alone compared to less expensive Windows laptops and Chromebooks, and HP appears to just be throwing things against the wall and seeing what sticks. With new form factors allowing for real innovation in the PC industry, HP clearly needs a change of strategy."

IBM Earnings Preview: Does Revenue Growth Really Matter?,"Jul 16, 2014 at 11:00AM","Shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) have been essentially flat over the past year, fluctuating around the same level due to concerns that the company's hardware business is falling apart. During the first quarter, revenue from IBM's Systems and Technology group declined by 23% year-over-year, and the segment recorded a $660 million pre-tax loss. The market hasn't been kind to IBM in light of these results, and the company's stock has been greatly underperforming other sellers of enterprise hardware, such as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ).IBM DATA BY YCHARTSAs IBM prepares to report its second quarter earnings after market close on July 17, analysts are expecting continued revenue declines. The most important question that investors need to ask themselves is: does it really matter?A decade of stagnationRevenue stagnation is nothing new for IBM. Over the past decade, IBM's revenue has been essentially flat, so the company's recent troubles really aren't out of the ordinary.While revenue hasn't been growing, earnings per share has tripled over the past decade. A combination of rising margins and aggressive share buybacks have pushed the company's EPS from about $5 in 2004 to $15 in 2013, all while revenue has only grown by 3.5% during that time.Why hasn't revenue been growing? Because IBM has a history of selling off businesses where it is unable to gain or maintain a competitive advantage. The company sold its PC business back in 2004, and it's currently attempting to gain approval for the sale of its x86 server business. In addition, Bloomberg recently reported that IBM is close to a deal to sell its chip foundry business, estimated to be losing as much as $1.5 billion per year, to Globalfoundries.IBM has no advantages in either the x86 server business, where most servers are powered by Intel chips, or the chip foundry business, which has become ultra-competitive in recent years. Given the choice between growing revenue and ditching lackluster businesses, IBM typically chooses the latter. The sale of businesses like these, and the focus on areas where the company has a competitive advantage, is why IBM's revenue growth and earnings growth have deviated by so much in the past.The recent results from competitors in the server business bear out IBM's decision to sell. Hewlett-Packard relied on enterprise hardware for about 40% of its operating profit in its most recent quarter, and servers make up a large part of that segment. During the past two years, HP's enterprise hardware operating margin has been in continual decline, falling from around 18% to just 14.4% in the most recent quarter. Much like PCs, x86 servers are increasingly becoming a commodity, and IBM has done a far better job than HP in the past of relying too heavily on commodity products for its profits.Looking forwardThere are a few major catalysts for IBM going forward that investors should keep an eye on. First, once IBM closes the sale of both its x86 server operation and its chip foundry operation, the bottom line should see a significant boost. Both businesses are losing money, and shedding those assets will help undo some of the margin compression that IBM has suffered in the recent past.Second, the mainframe business will eventually recover. During the first quarter, revenue from System Z, which is IBM's mainframe computer system, declined by a whopping 40% year-over-year. This may sound terrible, but the mainframe business is cyclical, rising when IBM refreshes the hardware, and declining in between. There's no reason to believe that the current decline is any different, as many industries, like banking, remain locked into the mainframe ecosystem.Third, investments in new R&D projects should continue to drive innovation at the company. IBM's Watson, the Jeopardy-winning computer system that IBM developed to process natural language and make hypotheses, is being turned into its own business unit with a $1 billion investment, and IBM hopes to derive $10 billion in revenue from the system within the next decade. Watson has plenty of possible applications, ranging from aiding doctors in making diagnoses to creating the perfect barbecue sauce.A BARBECUE SAUCE RECIPE CREATED BY IBM'S WATSON. SOURCE: IBMIBM is also investing $3 billion over the next five years in advanced chip design, with plans to push transistor sizes down to 7nm, possibly using exotic materials like carbon nanotubes as an alternative to silicon. This is a big investment, representing about 10% of the company's annual R&D spending, and there are very few companies on earth with the expertise necessary to attempt such a project. If IBM succeeds, it could lead to enormous gains in processor performance and efficiency. This is a long-term project, so don't expect progress anytime soon, but IBM is positioning itself to lead the way as the amount of data that companies are dealing with continues to explode.The bottom lineWhile IBM will likely report another revenue decline, it seems that a mountain is being made of a molehill. IBM's revenue hasn't really grown for a decade as the company has shed underperforming businesses, and its focus on areas where it can gain a competitive advantage has led to exceptional margins. Going forward, IBM is making investments in the future while it exits commodity businesses, and the result should be long-term earnings growth for the company.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Xiaomi vs. Lenovo: The War Between China’s Top Smartphone Makers,"Nov 4, 2014 at 3:40PM","Xiaomi recently became the third largest smartphone maker in the world for a single day, right before Lenovo's (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY) acquisition of Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Motorola Mobility closed and bumped China's top smartphone maker back down to fourth place.Xiaomi has enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top of the market over the past year, toppling former market leader Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) along the way, but how will it fare against the combined threat of Lenovo, the top PC maker in the world, and Motorola? Why Xiaomi should worry about LenovoLenovo has a tradition of buying mature technologies, like IBM's (NYSE:IBM) PC business, once demand in developed markets has peaked. It then sells these products on a higher volume and lower margin business model. Lenovo then slowly alters these devices, as it did from the ThinkPad to the Yoga laptop, based on market demand. That steady strategy helped it oust Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ) as the world's top PC maker two years ago.LENOVO'S K900. SOURCE: LENOVOThat's why Lenovo acquired Motorola. Just as IBM gave up on its PC business, Google eventually gave up on Motorola after buying the besieged handset maker for $12.5 billion in 2012. After selling Motorola's set-top box business to Arris (NASDAQ: ARRS) for $2.35 billion and launching the poorly received Moto X and G, Google gave up and sold the money-losing business to Lenovo for $2.9 billion.The key question now is whether Lenovo can make Motorola relevant again. Lenovo states that it shipped 16.9 million of its own smartphones in the third quarter, while Motorola shipped 8.7 million devices. Combined, those two brands accounted for 8.7% of the global smartphone market, compared to Xiaomi's 5.3%. While that's a nice slice of the market, shipments of Lenovo-branded devices have slowed, posting 30% year-over-year growth in the third quarter, compared to 74% growth a year ago. Xiaomi, by comparison, posted whopping growth of 211%. Motorola also hasn't squeezed out a profit for four consecutive years, according to Strategy Analytics.Despite those challenges, Barclays analysts Kirk Yang and Ric Cheng expect Lenovo to break even on its Motorola investment within two to four quarters, compared to the four to six quarters that the company originally forecast. That bullish forecast is based on the fact that the Motorola brand has stronger brand recognition than Xiaomi or Huawei outside of China. Therefore, market gains outside of China could help Lenovo/Motorola extend its lead over Xiaomi, which is still restricted to a handful of markets. That dual-brand strategy is also expected to allow Lenovo to sell its low-end smartphones in China, India, and other emerging markets, while selling mid to high-range Motorola devices in developed markets.Why Lenovo shouldn't underestimate XiaomiLenovo will have an edge over Xiaomi in developed markets, but it will have a tough time taking it down in China. According to Kantar Worldpanel Comtech, Xiaomi controls 30.3% of the Chinese market, followed by Samsung with 18.4%. IDC notes that Lenovo currently controls 12.5% of the market.XIAOMI'S MI 4. SOURCE: XIAOMIXiaomi has grown quickly using several unorthodox strategies. It reportedly only spends around 1% of its revenue on advertising, compared to 5% for Samsung. Instead, it relies on ""flash sales"" to sell a limited number of units on the Internet, which generates hype and word-of-mouth advertising across social media. Xiaomi also avoids brick-and-mortar retailers, opting to release limited batches of devices periodically. This eliminates an inventory buildup of unsold phones, which forced Samsung to increase marketing costs to clear out unsold devices earlier this year.As a result, Xiaomi squeezes out phones with high-end specs at low to midrange prices, and adopts a high volume, low margin model to quickly gain market share. As a result, Xiaomi's devices also compare favorably to low-end devices, like Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Lumia 530, which is clearly designed as a budget device.Lenovo's Moto branding won't help much in China, where Xiaomi is already considered the national brand. Therefore, the only way to tackle Xiaomi is with cheaper Lenovo-branded smartphones. But if Lenovo engages in a prolonged pricing war against Xiaomi with a traditional marketing model (as Samsung tried to do), it could end up with annual losses for both its Lenovo and Motorola brands.The road aheadLenovo certainly faces a lot of questions regarding its mobile business now that the deal with Google is closed, but I think the company has a good chance of turning around Motorola's business in the same way that it revived the ThinkPad brand. But just like that acquisition, it could take years -- not the few quarters that analysts suggest -- to see meaningful results.But if Lenovo is smart about its maintenance of both brands, it could maintain a foothold in developed markets with the Motorola brand while spreading the Lenovo brand across emerging markets, giving it a two-pronged approach that Xiaomi and Huawei notably lack.10 stocks we like better than LENOVO GROUP LTD.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Lenovo Closes Deal for IBM's Server Business: Winners and Losers,"Oct 3, 2014 at 11:28AM","After months of waiting for approval from both U.S. and Chinese regulators, Lenovo Group (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY) is finally set to close the deal to buy International Business Machines' (NYSE:IBM) x86 server business. Lenovo's goal is to become the leading server vendor in the world, much like it did in the PC market after buying IBM's PC business 10 years ago. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), which lost the title of the top worldwide PC vendor to Lenovo in 2013, could suffer the same fate in the server market as well.The winners: Lenovo and IBMThis deal, where Lenovo will pay IBM $2.1 billion for the x86 portion of its server business, benefits both Lenovo and IBM. Lenovo, a company that has grown rapidly over the past decade as it steadily conquered the PC market, will need to look beyond PCs in order to continue growing in the future. Mobile devices like smartphones and tablets are part of the company's strategy, but enterprise hardware looks to be the most promising growth driver.Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing has stated that he expects the x86 server unit to generate $5 billion of revenue during its first year, along with higher margins compared to the 4% margin of Lenovo's PC business. That's a minimum of $200 million in additional operating profit, representing a nearly 20% increase compared to the most recently reported fiscal year.Beyond the first year, Lenovo is ultimately aiming to win market share from competitors like HP and Dell, eventually becoming the top server vendor in the world. About $50 billion in servers are sold globally each year, putting Lenovo's expected market share after the IBM purchase at 10%. There's plenty of room to grow, and if Lenovo can do the same in the server market as it did in the PC market, the company's server market share could double before the end of the decade.It may seem like IBM is getting the short end of the stick with this deal, but unloading its x86 server business fits in with the company's overall strategy. There's very little differentiation between x86 servers, which are predominantly powered by Intel chips, and this has led to the increasing commoditization of the market. IBM is not a seller of commodity products, and it's clear that the x86 server business needed to go.IBM is keeping its other enterprise hardware units, most notably its System Z mainframes. IBM's mainframe computers remain critical to many industries, and IBM derives a significant part of its profits from software and services related to mainframes. While IBM has a huge advantage in the mainframe portion of the server market, with extremely high switching costs for many customers, it has no such advantage in the x86 server market, and dumping the commodity business frees IBM from having to compete in a market with far lower margins than the rest of its business.The loser: HPWhile there's no guarantee that Lenovo will be able to win server market share, the company's track record in the PC market should have HP very worried. HP is the leading server vendor, with a market share of around 25%, and a significant portion of the company's profits are derived from enterprise hardware. During the most recently reported quarter, about 41% of HP's operating profit came from its enterprise group, and nearly half of the revenue in this segment came from servers. In other words, a loss of server market share would not be kind to HP's bottom line.Falling margins would also hurt HP, and while the operating margin in its enterprise group has already been declining for the past couple of years, further declines could be driven by Lenovo's aggressiveness in going after server market share. When IBM exits a business, as it did with PCs 10 years ago, there's a good chance that margins for the industry are on their way down.HP is hoping that its Moonshot servers will create a brighter future for its server business. Moonshot servers are powered by the kinds of low-power chips typically found in phones, as opposed to traditional servers powered by high-end Intel chips. HP launched its first Moonshot servers last year, but so far they've failed to meet expectations. The first 64-bit Moonshot servers were recently announced, powered by new 64-bit ARM chips, but Intel's dominance will be a big barrier to the success of the platform. While Moonshot could potentially be something that allows HP's products to stand out, particularly important with Lenovo ready to pounce, success of the project is far from guaranteed.Final thoughtsLenovo has the opportunity to greatly expand its presence in the enterprise hardware market with the purchase of IBM's x86 server business, and market leader HP stands to lose the most. Lenovo has already stolen the title of the top PC vendor in the world from HP, and now it's looking to do the same in the server market. Time will tell whether Lenovo's strategy will pay off, but HP investors certainly have something to worry about."
A Few Reasons Why Workday Can Continue Its Terrific Growth,"Jul 7, 2014 at 3:00PM","Cloud computing has opened up big opportunities for several players, and Workday's (NASDAQ:WDAY) first-quarter results indicate that it is making the most of it. Driven by strong demand for applications such as Workday Recruiting and Workday Financial Management, the company's revenue has increased at a fast pace. Workday's Human Capital Management (HCM) solutions have been selected by companies such as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), and this can act as a catalyst going forward.Workday is aggressively investing in its products to land more clients in the face of competition from established players like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Even though the company posted a 74% year-over-year jump in revenue in the first quarter, its net loss widened due to investments in product development, marketing, and sales. However, the company's outlook for the second quarter was better than expected, indicating the strong adoption of its solutions.A robust outlook driven by appealing productsWorkday expects second-quarter revenue in the range of $173 million-$178 million, exceeding the consensus estimate of $171.3 million. For the full year, the company sees revenue of $730 million-$750 million, the midpoint of which exceeds the consensus estimate of $735 million. Moreover, Workday expects its subscription revenue to grow 69%-73% year over year. This rapid growth can be attributed to Workday's product development. It has remodeled its traditional application tracking system with Workday Recruiting, its newest application. Workday Recruiting is seeing strong demand and has been adopted by more than 70 companies since its launch in April. The company credits this success to a strong development team, with more than six design partners focusing on bringing innovative business solutions to the table.In addition, Workday unveiled Workday 22, which includes more than 350 new HR and finance features. Of these 350 new features, 68 have come directly from customer ideas and input. Looking ahead, the company is working on the development of Workday 23, based on requests from customers and partners to host applications in Workday's data center. This move will broaden its scope in big data analytics. Strong customer growthWorkday added more than 60 new customers during the first quarter, bringing its tally to 675 customers.HP was a big name that opted for its HR solutions. It is now using Workday's cloud-based HR software to manage its 300,000-strong workforce across 100 countries. What's more, HP has decided to monetize Workday's service by allowing other companies to integrate the cloud-based HR platform into their current information technology infrastructures.After spending 15 months integrating Workday's solutions into its own platform, HP has gained strong insights regarding the offering. During the implementation phase, HP integrated data from 400 different applications across varied functions including payroll and finance. HP will now use the expertise that it has gained by taking Workday's solutions to other companies. Since Workday's platform is cloud-based, HP claims that it will provide flexibility to the customer by enabling extensive prototyping that is not possible in non-cloud platforms. Since HP will now promote Workday's solutions, the company can expect to see an increase in attach rates of its HR solutions.Workday is seeing growth in other areas also. It landed a record number of financial customers during the first quarter, winning over 80 new clients for its financial solutions. Apart from this, the company is focused on driving customer satisfaction by providing them with cutting-edge support when they deploy new software applications. This will help Workday maintain healthy renewal and retention rates of customers. Oracle's threatWorkday's growth is impressive despite competition from Oracle, which is making significant moves in HCM. Oracle has several partners (including Accenture, KPMG, and Cognizant) that use its HCM software. It recently upgraded Oracle HCM Cloud, equipping it with new mobile functionality, improvements in the user experience, and better analytics. All in all, Oracle included more than 200 new features in its latest HCM update.In addition, Oracle has a strong sales force. The company has sales representatives in more than 60 countries for its cloud products. There are also around 19,000 consultants certified to sell its HCM, ERP, and e-commerce products. In such a scenario, it is important for Workday to continue improving its solutions.The bottom lineWorkday is expected to grow at a better rate than the industry average. Over the next five years, the company's annual earnings growth projection stands at 49%, while the industry average is less than 20%. The company also has a strong balance sheet, with $1.87 billion in cash and just $484 million in debt. As a result, it can continue making aggressive investments in its product lineup to tap the cloud opportunity. The company's stock is up just 10% in 2014, but it may get better in the long run due to its impressive customer growth and innovative solutions."
3D Printing Stocks Quick Guide: 9 Charts Investors Need to See,"Dec 7, 2014 at 10:05AM","Whether you're a potential 3D printing investor or an existing one, here's a very broad and brief overview to get you up to speed fast on the current environment for 3D printing stocks.The former high-flying pure plays got grounded in 20143D printing stocks, in general, have seen considerable price run-ups in recent years, so it's perhaps not surprising that the group has come crashing down.Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and Arcam (NASDAQOTH:AMAVF) have been performing better than 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), and voxeljet (NYSE:VJET), largely because they've turned in solid earnings reports in 2014. A big factor in voxeljet's poor relative performance, however, is timing: It went public in October 2013 while 3D printing mania was in full force, so its valuation was bid up to stratospheric levels. The longer-term performance pictures are prettierLeading companies 3D Systems and Stratasys are the only industry pure plays that have been publicly traded for at least three years. Major non-pure plays are less volatileDassault Systemes and Autodesk make computer-aided design software, which is used in a variety of applications, including 3D printing. Also, earlier this year, Autodesk released Spark, its open 3D-printing platform. Proto Labs provides quick-turnaround prototyping and smaller production runs. It's mainly involved in conventional manufacturing, but recently expanded into 3D printing. Hewlett-Packard's a potential future threat CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF HP'S 3D PRINTER. SOURCE: HEWLETT-PACKARD.In October, Hewlett-Packard announced plans to bring an enterprise-focused 3D printer based upon its Multi Jet Fusion technology to market in 2016. The printer will reportedly be 10 times faster than those powered by the leading 3D-printing technologies. Investors in 3D printing stocks shouldn't be overly concerned at this point. There's a big difference between announcing a compelling product and successfully bringing it to market. Additionally, no single technology will likely ever be the best fit for all applications and materials. However, investors shouldn't underestimate the potential threat deep-pocketed HP presents. Stratasys and Arcam are revenue growth leadersStratasys and Arcam are the only two pure plays that have been posting the kind of revenue growth we'd expect from companies occupying a fast-growing space. Only 3D Systems and Arcam are profitable 3D Systems and Stratasys are pursuing turbocharged growth strategies that involve sacrificing short-term profits in order to increase long-term growth prospects. So, profits from a generally accepted accounting principles basis are under pressure. Stratasys doesn't stack up favorably to 3D Systems here, but that's largely because of its 2012 megamerger with Objet and its 2013 acquisition of MakerBot. Analysts expect Stratasys to return to profitability next year. A look at valuationsCompanyMarket CapPrice/SalesP/EForward P/E 5-Yr.

Analysts don't expect ExOne to be profitable in five years, as indicated by its negative PEG. Powerful projected growth DATA SOURCE: WOHLERS ASSOCIATES.Global revenue from 3D printing grew 34.9% year over year in 2013. More important, industry analyst Wohlers Associates expects the market to exceed $21 billion in 2020 -- more than a 31% average annual growth rate.  While 2014 has battered the 3D printing stocks, valuations have come down while projected growth rates for the industry have increased. If competition remains in check, select 3D printing stocks could rise again over the long term. This remains a volatile group that only risk-tolerant investors should be considering."
Will Lenovo’s Yoga Tablet 2 Pro Kill Apple’s iPad Air 2?,"Oct 21, 2014 at 2:13PM","The tablet wars are heating up between two tech titans: Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY), the largest PC maker in the world, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the top tablet maker in the world.Lenovo recently unveiled the Yoga Tablet 2 Pro, a 13.3-inch Android tablet with two 1.5W front-facing speakers, a 5W JBL subwoofer, and a built-in projector. The device was reportedly designed with input from Ashton Kutcher, who has been channeling Steve Jobs (whom he portrayed in Jobs) after being hired as Lenovo's spokesman and ""product engineer"" last year.Apple unveiled two tablets at its iPad event on Oct. 16: the 9.7-inch iPad Air 2, which is 18% slimmer than its predecessor, and the 7.9-inch iPad Mini 3, which features Touch ID and slightly better cameras. The long-rumored iPad Pro, which could have a 12.9-inch display, was noticeably absent.LENOVO'S YOGA TABLET 2 PRO. SOURCE: LENOVOComparing the Yoga Tablet 2 Pro to Apple's iPad Air 2 raises some interesting comparisons. Whereas Lenovo is storming ahead with daring designs which may or may not resonate with users, Apple's new iPads felt uninspired.Apple has struggled with declining year-over-year iPad sales for three consecutive quarters, with shipments falling 13% last quarter to 12.3 million units. That makes it vulnerable to disruption from hungry new competitors like Lenovo, which previously toppled PC titans Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Dell with its convertible Yoga laptops.Should Apple do more to defend its iPads, which accounted for 12.6% of the company's top line last quarter, from Lenovo's new tablets?The curious business of bigger tabletsDespite Apple's troubles with the iPad, interest in other tablets isn't declining. Gartner forecasts that global tablet shipments will climb 11% year over year and hit 229 million units in 2014. While that's a disappointing drop from the 55% growth in tablet sales between 2012 and 2013, it doesn't explain why Apple's iPad sales are falling year over year.The problem with Apple's tablets is that smaller models, like the iPad Mini, are being gobbled up by phablets, while larger ones, like the iPad Air, face significant competition from two-in-one devices like Lenovo's Yoga Pro 3. Apple itself is contributing to this problem with the iPhone 6 Plus, which will likely cannibalize sales of the iPad Mini 3.That's why companies are experimenting with new screen sizes and form factors. Since the 6- to 10-inch market was saturated by smartphones, phablets, and tablets, companies launched a flood of larger all-in-one devices last year, like Dell's 18.4-inch XPS 18, Sony's 20-inch VAIO Tap 20, Asus' 18.4-inch Transformer AIO tablet, and HP's 20-inch Envy Rove. While those devices were decent desktop PCs, they failed miserably at being tablets due to their size and weight.HP'S ENVY ROVE. SOURCE: HPA 13-inch tablet, which is the size of a midsize laptop, seems to be more practical as a portable device. However, 13-inch tablets don't feel necessary when compared to lightweight 13-inch laptops or convertibles. That's probably why Lenovo added a built-in projector and impressive sound system as additional incentives, and why Apple is reluctant to launch a comparable device.Yoga Tablet 2 Pro vs. iPad Air 2, by the numbersTo see if the Yoga Tablet 2 Pro can actually steal customers away from Apple, however, we should take a look at how their specs stack up against each other:  CPU/RAMBatteryWeightCamerasExtrasPriceApple iPad Air 2 (9.7 inch)64-bit A8X, 2GB10 hours0.96 lb.(Wi-Fi)0.98 lb.(Wi-Fi/Cellular)8 MP rear, 1.2 MP frontTouch ID$499 (16GB Wi-Fi) to $829 (128GB Wi-Fi/Cellular)Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 Pro (13.3 inch)Intel Atom Z3745, 2GB15 hours2.09 lbs.8 MP rear, 1.6 MP frontProjector, subwoofer$500 (32GB)SOURCE: COMPANY WEBSITESThe Yoga Tablet 2 Pro is more than twice as heavy as the iPad Air 2, although it offers a larger screen, 50% better battery life, a better front-facing camera, and a built-in projector and subwoofer. Moreover, the $500 model offers twice as much internal storage as a comparably priced iPad Air 2. That could be enough to steal the spotlight from the iPad Air 2, which only offers incremental improvements over its predecessor.Apple's simple strategy of product line refreshes worked in the past when demand for iPads was strong. But now that demand is declining, Apple needs to do more to show both existing iPad owners and potential new customers that the iPad Air 2 is worth buying.The takeawayThe iPad looks like it's headed down the same path as the iPod. It will be slimmed down in different colors, but demand will drop off as sales are cannibalized by other products and current users stop upgrading their devices every year.Lenovo's Yoga Tablet 2 Pro might not wipe out the iPad Air 2, but it's certainly more innovative than anything Apple showed us on Oct. 16. If Lenovo starts to get even crazier with its designs -- such as slapping projectors and subwoofers on smaller tablets -- Apple could lose market share in tablets a lot faster than investors expect.

Why Microsoft's Surface Pro Could Be One of the Most Important Devices of 2015,"Dec 13, 2014 at 8:40AM","When many investors think about the hottest tech devices of 2014, they probably think of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 6, Samsung's scattergun selection of smartwatches, or Facebook's Oculus Rift.But looking ahead, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Surface Pro could be one of the top devices to watch in 2015. Not only is this ""laplet"" important for Microsoft, but it could play a pivotal role in the future of PCs and tablets.MICROSOFT'S SURFACE PRO 3. SOURCE: MICROSOFT.The evolution of PCs and the decline of tabletsWhen Apple's iPad made tablets cool again in 2010, some companies believed that they would render traditional desktops and laptops obsolete.Hewlett-Packard famously overreacted by launching (and quickly scrapping) its TouchPad webOS tablet in 2011. Microsoft then tripped up its hardware allies with Windows 8, a confusing combination of tablet and PC operating systems which alienated users of both. Frustrated PC makers launched Android tablets, but those devices were quickly crushed by sleeker tablets from Samsung, which sold tablets continuously since 2010.The PC market didn't crash, but sales declined. Research firm Gartner expects PC shipments (desktops and traditional notebooks) to slide 6.7% year-over-year in 2014, and another 5.3% in 2015 to 261.7 million units. However, Gartner expects sales of ""ultramobile and premium"" devices, which include 2-in-1 devices like Microsoft's Surface and Lenovo's Yoga Pro devices, to soar 50% in 2014, and another 70.6% in 2015 to 55 million units.Meanwhile, tablet sales are grinding to a halt. IDC expects the tablet market to only grow 7.2% in 2014 to 235.7 million units, a major slowdown from the 52.5% growth it posted in 2013. This slowdown, reflected in Apple's three consecutive quarters of declining iPad sales, has been attributed to longer upgrade cycles and the rise of phablets and 2-in-1 devices.Why Microsoft's Surface Pro mattersA phablet may replace a tablet as a media consumption and gaming device, but Android and iOS tablets still aren't comparable productivity devices as Windows laptops. Although Microsoft offers free versions of Office 365 for iOS and Android, and Adobe offers its Creative Cloud for both platforms (a preview version on Android), many Windows apps still lack mobile equivalents.That's where Microsoft's Surface Pro 3 acting as a bridge between traditional laptops and tablets, comes in. Bridging the gap between tablets and laptops might not matter much to mainstream consumers, but it matters to large businesses, most of which are dependent on Windows-compatible software.Startups and small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) can start fresh with tablets and cloud-based servers. However, large companies are burdened with years of legacy data and software, making it impractical to upgrade aging PCs to iPads. That makes the Surface Pro 3, which runs on Windows, an ideal replacement for older Windows PCs. The Surface can transform into a full desktop via a docking station, and it can be carried around the workplace -- resolving the need for custom iPad apps tethered to PC workstations.When Surface sales more than doubled both year-over-year and sequentially to $908 million last quarter, Microsoft attributed that growth to ""strong interest from students, professionals, and increasingly enterprises"".Windows 10 and the cloudIf enterprise adoption of the Surface Pro continues into next year, it would serve as an ideal launch platform for Windows 10 in mid-2015.If Windows 10 is really a free or cheap upgrade for Windows 8 devices (as Microsoft's Indonesia President previously suggested), Microsoft could use the Surface to secure its Windows 10 user base against enterprise challengers like Apple and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Since Windows 10 will be the ""One Windows"" OS for desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, a strong enterprise presence could cast a halo effect on sales of all consumer-facing Windows devices.SOURCE: MICROSOFT.More importantly, it would allow Microsoft to tether all of these devices to its rapidly growing cloud ecosystem. At the end of fiscal 2014, Microsoft reported that its annual run rate for its cloud business had doubled to $4.4 billion.What Microsoft investors should watchIf Surface sales keep rising next year, its hardware allies will likely launch more similar Windows devices instead of traditional tablets. This would help Microsoft expand its defensive moat against disruptive challengers like Apple and Google.But if Surface sales unexpectedly fall, it could mean that Apple, which is partnered with IBM in a massive enterprise initiative, and Google, which is offering Chromebooks to SMBs, are gaining ground in large businesses.10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Google Android 5.0 vs. Microsoft Windows 10: Which OS Will Rule Phones and PCs?,"Oct 23, 2014 at 8:30AM","Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have both recently taken steps to unify their mobile and desktop operating systems.This has been a long time coming. Five years ago, Google co-founder Sergey Brin predicted that Android and Chrome OS would likely ""converge over time"". Android apps have recently appeared on Chromebooks and vice versa, and Google asked Hiroshi Lockheimer, the VP of Android, to also lead the Chrome engineering team. These moves strongly indicate that the convergence of Google's mobile and desktop operating systems could be right around the corner.Meanwhile, Microsoft has repeatedly emphasized its ""One Windows"" strategy, which will unite phones, tablets, and PCs under a single operating system. Today, the Windows market is fragmented between Windows Phone, Windows RT, and Windows 8 -- three separate systems which aren't fully compatible with each other. With Windows 10, the number-skipping upgrade which will arrive next year, Microsoft will eliminate those incompatibilities with a single cross-platform OS.SOURCE: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS.Therefore, the stage has been set for a massive clash between the two tech titans to unite the mobile and desktop markets. Is there room for both companies to thrive, or will one giant eventually crush the other?How Google plans to expand into PCsAndroid is currently installed on 84.7% of the world's smartphones, up from 79.6% a year earlier, according to IDC's second quarter numbers. Microsoft's Windows Phone only controlled 2.5% of the market, down from 3.4% a year ago.For Google, the main challenge is to grow Android beyond mobile devices. Previous efforts to deploy Android as a full laptop OS have proven awkward and expensive. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) recently launched the Android-powered HP Slatebook 14, but Android apps were poorly optimized for the device, and it launched at $430 -- considerably more than Chromebooks or low-end Windows laptops.Meanwhile, Chromebooks have gained lots of traction thanks to their sub-$300 price tags and cloud connections to Google's services. Gartner expects sales of Chromebooks -- which are manufactured by Samsung, Acer, and other partners -- to nearly triple from 5.2 million in 2014 to 14.2 million by 2017. While that year-over-year growth is impressive, Chromebooks currently only represent less than 2% of the world's PC market.CHROMEBOOKS. SOURCE: GOOGLE.To gain ground against Windows PCs, Google recently launched its ""Chromebooks for Work"" initiative, which adds new pricing plans and features for enterprise use. Google is also encouraging Android users to buy Chromebooks with new Android-exclusive features. ""Easy Unlock"" will allow Android users to unlock their Chromebook via Bluetooth, Android notifications will show up on Chromebook screens, and more Android apps are expected to arrive on Chrome OS.How Microsoft plans to expand into mobileMeanwhile, Microsoft controls over 90% of the world's PC market with Windows.According to Net Market Share, 12% of PC users are using Windows 8/8.1, 53% are sticking to Windows 7, and 24% are still stubbornly holding on to Windows XP. Microsoft's first move would be to get all of its users on the same page by convincing them to upgrade to Windows 10 (with possibly free or cheap upgrades).The second step would be to properly integrate Windows 10 phones with PCs. Microsoft has stated that the Windows 10 interface will scale down between the desktop, tablet, and phone versions while running on the same kernel. This means that the desktop version of an app could scale down -- like the desktop/mobile versions of a web page -- depending on the device used. Meanwhile, software and saved data across multiple platforms via the cloud.SOURCE: MICROSOFT.For now, Windows Phone will be a tough platform to turn around as it fumbles around in low-end emerging markets. However, Microsoft recently partnered with Toshiba, Acer, and other companies to launch cheap Windows 8.1 tablets. Toshiba's Encore Mini, for example, only costs $99 -- which could be a tempting choice compared to a low-end Android tablet.In my opinion, if Microsoft makes progress with these low-end tablets, it's a great setup to enter the phablets (5.3 to 6.9-inch phones) market with Windows 10 devices. If that happens, Microsoft could essentially offer a scaled down Windows desktop experience via a smartphone -- which could appeal to plenty of PC users worldwide.The Foolish final verdictIn conclusion, tech investors should remember that Google and Microsoft are expanding out of their respective home turfs into enemy territory.Both companies face steep challenges ahead, but Google's Chromebooks give it an edge over Microsoft. Although Chromebooks only account for a small percentage of the PC market, they are growing quickly in a sluggish market. If Chromebooks gain more market share over the next few years, Microsoft could lose longtime Windows users, which could undermine the appeal of Windows 10 phones.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

5 Things Hewlett-Packard Company Management Wants You to Know,"May 27, 2015 at 10:42AM","When Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) reported mixed quarterly results last week, the corresponding 3% pop in its stock price did not seem to make sense. After all, revenue fell about 7% year-over-year to $25.5 billion, hindered by declines in each of its operating segments. And while adjusted earnings dropped by just a penny per share over the same period to $0.87, keep in mind that figure was helped by repurchase of 19 million shares during the quarter, totaling $659 million. Analysts, for their part, were anticipating lower earnings of $0.86 per share but higher revenue of $25.6 billion.But the reasons behind the move were more clear after HP management spent roughly an hour with analysts on the subsequent conference call, shedding light on its performance. Here are five crucial insights from the discussion that help explain why the market celebrated these mixed results.1. On executing with ""no distractions""Turning to our execution, we have made significant progress across a lot of fronts over the past six months, and importantly, we've seen no distractions from running the business. In fact, the go-to-market approach of this company has drastically improved over the past three years, and I see that getting stronger going forward. -- CEO Meg WhitmanRemember, HP is nearing its planned separation into two distinct companies -- one to handle its personal systems and printing segments and another to tackle its enterprise, cloud, software and services divisions -- so investors have been worried about possible distractions stemming from that impending separation. It is encouraging to hear that such distractions are not an issue for the time being, especially when Whitman insisted earlier in the call she is confident that, given the substantial progress they have made, HP will complete the separation by the end of this fiscal year.2. Industry standard servers are now leading the chargeIndustry standard servers had a very strong quarter, growing 17% in constant currency with growth across all regions, driven by strong adoption of our Gen9 portfolio and strength in density-optimized in support of the explosion of big data in the market. -- WhitmanFor perspective, this is an interesting shift as the personal systems segment has effectively remained the brightest spot in its quarterly results for the better part of the past year. That is not to say personal systems is now doing poorly -- though segment revenue declined 5%, unit sales actually rose 2% year-over-year including a 19% rise in notebook units. And that, Whitman says, helped the personal systems business continue to ""outgrow the overall market and all competitors.""Nonetheless, it is exciting to see this acceleration for industry standard servers, driven by demand for big data which shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.3. On expected cost savings, ""dis-synergies""Even at this early stage, each new organization is optimizing for the realities of their markets and unique competitive sets. As we dive deep into the planned organizations, we've identified both dis-synergies required to run separate companies, as well as opportunities to streamline our processes and ultimately improve both cost structures. -- WhitmanSpecifically, as CFO Catherine Lesjak elaborated later in the call, HP has now identified ""dis-synergies"" of $400 million to $450 million associated with the reorganization. These costs will be split roughly equally between the two new companies and are primarily related to required corporate functions such as finance, legal, IT, real estate, and human resources. That said, HP also anticipates that it could reduce operating costs by a gross of up to $1 billion annually, including enough in the near-term to offset over half the dis-synergies in fiscal 2016. Then, starting in fiscal 2017, ongoing cost reduction efforts should more than offset the dis-synergies.4. A ""groundbreaking"" new Chinese partnership[J]ust this morning, we announced a groundbreaking partnership that will bring together HP's Chinese enterprise technology assets and China's prestigious Tsinghua University to create the leading Chinese provider of IT infrastructure. Under the agreement, Tsinghua will purchase a 51% stake in a new business called H3C, comprising our H3C technologies business and HP's China-based server storage and technology services businesses, for approximately $2.3 billion. -- Whitman To put that into perspective, this values the H3C business at roughly $4.3 billion. By comparison, HP also closed on its acquisition of Aruba Networks earlier this month for a total consideration of $2.7 billion. But this H3C partnership is arguably even more compelling given the significant market opportunity China represents. ""In one move,"" Whitman elaborated, ""we have repositioned HP and shifted the entire technology landscape in the critical Chinese market to accelerate our overall performance and better serve our customers and partners.""5. How currencies are still hurting HPThe strength of the U.S. dollar negatively affected our reported revenue. For example, our second quarter revenue declined approximately 7% year-over-year as reported but only 2% in constant currency. In addition, the recent currency movements have enabled our competitors to price very aggressively. For example, aggressive pricing from our Japanese competitors in the printing business, given the weakness of the yen, continued to be a challenge. Finally, the currency movements and the associated repricing affected demand. We managed to offset the currency impact to company level operating profit in Q2 through hedges and repricing. -- WhitmanThese currency headwinds mark a continuation of similar challenges HP faced last quarter as well. But again, keep in mind this is simply the cost of doing business as a global company that generates over 65% of its revenue overseas. I feel the need to reiterate, however, that currencies will not always be a headwind going forward and are not indicative of broader problems with the HP business. As long as HP continues to gain share in the international markets where it operates, it should ultimately emerge a stronger company for it.Combine that long-term thinking with solid execution, accelerating demand for industry standard servers, and encouraging progress toward its business separation, and it is evident this quarter was significantly stronger than the headline numbers implied.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Hewlett-Packard Company's 3D Printer: What the Competition and Experts Think,"Feb 25, 2015 at 11:00AM","SOURCE: HP.Last November, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) officially unveiled its plans to enter the 3D printing market sometime in 2016 with a homegrown technology it's calling Multi Jet Fusion. According to the tech giant, Multi Jet Fusion will be up to 10 times faster than leading extrusion-based and selective laser sintering 3D printing technologies on the market today.Given the success HP has experienced in the 2D printing world, along with its expertise, resources, and enterprise reach, it's clear why industry watchers have been keeping a close eye on HP's hotly anticipated entrance into the 3D printing space. Here's what the competition and industry experts have been saying about HP's upcoming 3D printer.Don't underestimate the complexity required to become a meaningful playerPrior to HP's formal announcement, 3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) CEO Avi Reichental weighed in on HP's 3D printing entrance during the company's first-quarter 2014 earnings call:As to the questions about HP, look, we think that companies like HP have unlimited resources and capabilities and technology. But we also believe that entering in a meaningful way into the 3D printing space requires multiple technologies and print engines. We've been saying this for about five years. In the last few years, our competitors came to view this in the same way that we have and they all transitioned themselves from pure-play players to multiple print engines [technologies]. We've been saying this for about five years and of course we have seven print engines [technologies]. Again, [3D Systems has] a substantial first-mover advantage and cost advantage in those areas.And so, we take companies like HP very seriously. We also don't underestimate the degree of complexity that they would have to position themselves as a relevant and meaningful player across the design and manufacturing marketplaces that are demanding these products.From 3D Systems' perspective, because HP will initially be entering the 3D printing space with a single technology, Multi Jet Fusion, the tech giant won't be able to capitalize on all the growth potential 3D printing has to offer. 3D Systems bases this belief on the assumption that different 3D printing technologies are often best suited for specific applications, and the more 3D printing applications a company can serve, the greater its revenue-generating potential. With seven distinct 3D printing technologies in its portfolio -- the most of any 3D printing company -- 3D Systems' multi-faceted approach has arguably enabled the company to cater to the most diverse range of 3D printing applications.Maximizing valueDuring EuroMold 2014, the world's largest 3D printing conference held in Frankfurt, Germany, I asked Stratasys' (NASDAQ:SSYS) Fred Fischer, director fused deposition modeling and PolyJet applications, about HP entering the fray.Stratasys' recent research and development spending aligns nicely with Fischer's comments around the company's commitment of improving and maximizing the value of its products:SSYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE (QUARTERLY) DATA BY YCHARTS.Mothballing the competitionTerry Wohlers of Wohlers Associates, a leading 3D printing insights company that's been tracking the industry since its inception, made an incredibly bold statement about the prospect of Multi Jet Fusion when HP debuted the technology:SOURCE: HP.When I caught up with Tim Caffrey at EuroMold, Wohlers' senior consultant, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to have him elaborate on Terry's comment, which can be found in the video below, between 0:12 and 2:36:Given that Wohlers Associates is highly regarded across the 3D printing industry in terms of expertise and insights, this endorsement may carry significant weight in favor of HP's 3D printer over competitors and could potentially help the company drive initial sales.Potential challengesMcor Technologies, an Ireland-based 3D printing company that utilizes ordinary copy paper for its printers' primary material and can produce full-color 3D printed objects, understands the challenges HP may face when applying color treatment to its plastic-based parts:What to watch going forwardAlthough Stratasys and 3D Systems have formally gone on record about how HP's 3D printing entrance is validating for the 3D printing industry at large, the comments made by Wohlers Associates could lead one to believe the tech giant's entrance may pose a significant risk for 3D printing investors.Considering Multi Jet Fusion will cater to the professional and industrial 3D printing segments with a compelling value proposition in terms of speed, investors should monitor corresponding product revenues from 3D Systems and Stratasys in the quarters ahead of its release to try to gain early indications if HP is on the verge of becoming the next major 3D printing player.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Hewlett-Packard Company's Threat to 3D Printing Stocks Is Impossible to Calculate,"May 2, 2015 at 8:03AM","A VERY BOLD STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT OF A LEADING 3D PRINTING INSIGHTS COMPANY. SOURCE: HP.With tech juggernaut Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) entering the 3D printing game sometime in late 2016 with a plastic-based inkjet technology it's calling Multi Jet Fusion, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), and other 3D printing companies could be up against some serious competition.After all, HP claims that Multi Jet Fusion is 10 times faster than today's leading extrusion-based and selective laser sintering technologies, which will target industrial and professional markets. HP also has more than three times as much cash on its balance sheet than the 3D printing industry generated in worldwide revenue in 2014. Consequently, investors may have grown concerned that 3D printing stocks could have much to lose once HP's 3D printer goes up for sale. What isn't clear, though, is the extent to which HP's entrance could hurt established 3D printing companies. Unfortunately, it's impossible to know that answer.     WHAT HP'S 3D PRINTER WILL PROBABLY LOOK LIKE. SOURCE: HEWLETT-PACKARD.Does not computeAccording to Wohlers Report 2015, in 2014, the 3D printing industry generated $4.1 billion in worldwide revenue, and it is expected by grow by about 31% per year until 2020, eventually surpassing $21 billion in annual revenue. By 2017, the first full year that HP's 3D printer is expected to be available, the 3D printing industry is projected to generate revenue upward of $9 billion.Beyond this point, it's extremely difficult to assess how much of the industry's revenue HP will capture, and thus, the risk that it poses to 3D Systems, Stratasys, and the rest of the industry. There are too many unknown variables at play, including:   The cost of HP's 3D printer, which may dictate how many printers it can sell.  The versatility of HP's printer in terms of applications, which will likely determine the market share it can capture. Whether HP's 3D printer displaces competitor sales.How established 3D printing companies respond to HP's product.  If compelling new products or technologies enter the market that make HP's offering less exciting.Macroeconomic factors that could affect general 3D printing spending. While the above list isn't exhaustive, it illustrates the complexity of trying to predict the future of an industry experiencing rapid growth and change. That's why it's impossible to know before it's released if HP's 3D printer will capture 1%, 25%, or 80% of the industry's revenues.      AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT HP'S 3D PRINTER CAN MAKE. SOURCE: HEWLETT-PACKARD.What investors can evaluateBecause Mutli Jet Fusion leverages decades of HP's inkjet experience, 3D printing investors certainly shouldn't take the threat that HP poses lightly.Looking ahead, 3D printing stocks are at their greatest risk if Multi Jet Fusion can successfully replace competing 3D printing technologies as time goes on. The best recourse for companies against this potential disruption is diversification outside of Multi Jet Fusion's professional and industrial scope within plastics.In other words, if a 3D printing company is diversified in terms of materials and target markets, the immediate threat of HP entering the fray is probably being blown out of proportion.But at the end of the day, there are far too many variables to know with any certainty the actual risk that HP poses to 3D printing stocks.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Biggest Mergers and Acquisitions in Technology,"Apr 4, 2015 at 2:00PM","The tech industry has seen some of the most significant and largest acquisitions in corporate history.Below are five of the biggest -- in some cases in terms of dollars spent, in others, in terms of their significance. Whether it was a larger firm absorbing a start-up that later defined its business, or a tech giant absorbing an established rival, these acquisitions have all helped to define the current tech landscape.Google buys AndroidGoogle (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has made many prescient acquisitions over the years -- YouTube in 2006, Applied Semantics in 2003 -- but its acquisition of Android may have been the most significant. When Google purchased Android back in 2005, few people had ever heard of Andy Rubin's start-up. In terms of a raw dollar figure, the deal was rather insignificant (an estimated $50 million), but the resulting effects have been so notable (a Google executive later termed it ""its best deal ever"") that the purchase deserves its place on this list.Today, Android is one of the largest operating systems in the world, with around 1 billion active users, and a dominant share of the mobile market -- the overwhelming majority of smartphones and tablets sold worldwide run Google's operating system.Google doesn't profit from Android directly (it gives it away for free) but Android serves as a tapestry for Google's services, allowing it to push its products like Maps, search, and Gmail onto its many mobile users.Apple acquires Steve Jobs' NeXTLike Google's purchase of Android, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) acquisition of NeXT in late 1996 wasn't the largest in terms of dollars -- it cost just $400 million. But if it hadn't happened, Apple probably wouldn't be in business today, let alone be the world's largest company.The purchase of NeXT brought Steve Jobs back to Apple, and set the stage for the company's resurgence. Technologies developed at NeXT form the backbone of what are arguably Apple's two most important products: its operating systems. Both OS X (Mac) and iOS (iPhone, iPad) were built on technologies developed at NeXT, and Apple's exclusive use of these operating systems sets its products apart from competitors.AMD gets into graphics with ATIBoth Android and NeXT are, in hindsight, wildly successful acquisitions. The success of semiconductor giant AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) 2006 purchase of graphics maker ATI, however, is a bit less clear.For $5.4 billion, AMD entered the graphics market, buying what was then one of the top dedicated graphics card designers. At the time, AMD was coming off one of its most successful quarters ever (in terms of processor market share) and executives argued that the combination would allow the company to take even market share from Intel, as it could court PC OEMs with a combination of AMD processors and ATI graphics chips.It's not clear if the merger was a significant contributor, but AMD's business has definitely gone downhill since acquisition, and its current market cap (about $2 billion) is less than half of what it paid for ATI. In the graphics card market, Nvidia has surged ahead of AMD, while Intel completely dominates the PC processor market.Hewlett-Packard merges with CompaqHewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) $25 billion purchase of rival PC-maker Compaq is, like AMD's purchase of ATI, fairly controversial.The purchase did create a PC behemoth -- Hewlett-Packard is, to this day, one of the largest PC vendors in the world. But it may have tarnished Hewlett-Packard's culture and focus. Shareholders have certainly suffered. Since it announced the acquisition in September, 2001, Hewlett-Packard shares are up around 103% on a total return basis. The S&P 500, however, is up more than 138%.^SPXTR DATA BY YCHARTSTo be fair, other tech behemoths -- including both Microsoft and IBM -- have done even worse for their shareholders (returning about 102% and 91%, respectively) but Hewlett-Packard has largely wallowed in mediocrity since the acquisition, going through a string of CEOs and several failed attempts at transformation -- a sharp contrast to its massive success in the 1990s.The merger is even more interesting considering the fact that it was opposed by board member Walter Hewlett, son of Bill Hewlett, the co-founder of the company. Hewlett led a proxy battle in an attempt to block the merger, but was ultimately unsuccessful.AOL buys Time WarnerThe merger of AOL (NYSE:AOL) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) was one of the largest in history. In total, AOL spent about $162 billion to acquire the media giant, creating a corporate colossus that was supposed to -- at least in theory -- dominate the Internet. With Time Warner's networks and cable assets, and AOL's Internet service, the mashup appeared to hold great potential. The combined company may have been able to dictate the flow of media and advertising in the United States.Unfortunately, it is widely regarded as a disaster. In 2009, it came to an end, with Time Warner spinning AOL off. It also divested its cable company (Time Warner Cable) and later, its magazine publishing arm, Time, Inc. Although the share price of all the firms has rallied since the split, the market cap of all four firms combined (around $120 billion) remains a far cry from AOL-Time Warner's once enormous $350 billion valuation.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"3 Top Stocks to Invest in Computers: Intel Corporation, Lenovo Group, and Apple Inc.","Apr 10, 2015 at 9:05AM","The PC market -- which has been overshadowed by tablets and smartphones over the past few years -- isn't a high-growth one. Research firm Gartner expects worldwide PC shipments to edge up less than 1% annually in 2015.However, Gartner also expects PC shipments to bounce back nearly 4% in 2016, thanks to the upcoming launch of Microsoft's Windows 10 and newer processors. Therefore, contrarian investors might want to check out three top stocks that could benefit from renewed interest in the sector.1. IntelIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is the 800-pound gorilla in PC microprocessors. Its chips power nearly all servers, over 90% of notebooks, and more than 80% of desktops worldwide, according to research firm IDC. In 2014, revenue at its PC and Data Center businesses, which together accounted for 88% of its top line, respectively rose 4% and 18% annually.SOURCE: INTEL.Intel will likely keep dominating the server and PC markets because its chips remain the most advanced on the market. Intel's foundry business -- one of the four remaining foundries in the world -- enables it to launch smaller and more power-efficient designs than its ""fabless"" rivals. Last year, Intel was the first chipmaker to launch fanless 14nm chips, which power ultrathin devices like Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) new MacBook.However, two things could weigh Intel down in the near term. Last month, it slashed its first-quarter revenue guidance by nearly $1 billion, citing weak demand for business desktop upgrades. Starting this year, Intel will also combine its mobile business, which lost $4.2 billion in 2014, with its PC unit. That added weight could distort year-over-year comparisons.Although Intel has rallied nearly 20% over the past 12 months, it still trades at a reasonable 13.5 times trailing earnings, compared to the S&P 500's P/E of 20.2. LenovoA decade ago, Chinese PC maker Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY) acquired IBM's PC division. Today, Lenovo is the largest PC maker in the world, claiming 20% of the worldwide market at the end of 2014, according to IDC.In response to the rise of tablets, Lenovo gradually modified its Windows laptops into convertible devices that could be folded backwards into tablets. It expanded into Android tablets and smartphones as rival Hewlett-Packard struggled with leadership changes, a failed webOS tablet, and its disastrous acquisition of Autonomy.SOURCE: LENOVO.Last year, Lenovo also acquired IBM's low-end server business and Google's Motorola Mobility handset business. The Motorola acquisition made Lenovo the third largest smartphone maker in the world, with a 6.5% market share at the end of 2014, according to IDC.Last quarter, Lenovo's revenue surged 31% year over year, but its diluted EPS fell 9%. That earnings decline was mainly caused by the IBM and Motorola acquisitions. By comparison, HP's revenue fell 5% year over year and its diluted EPS slipped 1% in its most recent quarter.Lenovo's ADR shares have climbed nearly 30% over the past 12 months. Its trailing P/E of 18 makes it pricier than HP, which trades at just 12 times trailing GAAP earnings, but Lenovo has plenty of ways to grow its top and bottom lines in the near future.3. AppleMost Apple investors mainly focus on iPhone sales, which accounted for 69% of Apple's top line last quarter. However, rising Mac sales also make Apple a solid play on the PC market.Last quarter, Apple's Mac revenue accounted for 9% of Apple's top line. Revenue rose 9% year over year as unit sales improved 14%. Those gains are significant, because they could eventually help diversify Apple's top line away from the iPhone.THE NEW MACBOOK. SOURCE: APPLE.IDC reports that Apple's global market share in PCs climbed from 5.8% to 7.1% between the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2014, making it the fifth largest PC vendor in the world after Lenovo, HP, Dell, and Acer. Out of those five vendors, Apple reported the highest year-over-year shipment growth. In the U.S., Apple controls 12.2% of the PC market, ranking third behind HP and Dell.Apple enjoys two key strengths in the PC market: high-end appeal and a closed-off ecosystem. The former helps it sell Macs at higher margins than Windows-based PCs. The latter shields it from Windows-based rivals, since only Apple PCs can run OS X. Those two qualities also shield its iPhones from Android rivals.The long-term outlookIntel, Lenovo, and Apple are all solid investments in the PC market. Intel manufactures the most popular PC processors, Lenovo is the market leader in laptops and desktops, and Apple is the fastest-growing PC manufacturer. Therefore, all three companies should benefit as the PC market recovers its footing in 2016 and beyond."
Does Safra Catz Really Run the Show At Oracle Corporation?,"May 20, 2015 at 12:04PM","SAFRA CATZ, ORACLE CEO. IMAGE SOURCE: ORACLE.Safra Catz is currently co-CEO of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), sharing the software giant's top executive suite with former Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) head Mark Hurd. But if you have followed Oracle over the last decade and a half, Hurd's co-CEO title almost looks like an honorary degree. Isn't Safra Catz really running the show at Oracle -- kind of like she's already done for several years?The Hurd factorDon't get me wrong. Mark Hurd is a solid executive with a strong skill set. At Hewlett-Packard, his heavy-handed cost cuts lifted the embattled systems builder's operating margins from 4% to more than 9%. At the same time share prices more than doubled. So if you're looking for strong cost controls, Mark Hurd is the man for the job.But Hurd didn't build a business structure for the ages at HP. Cost-cutting helps the bottom line look good in the short term, but doesn't exactly drive stronger innovation and execution.Under Hurd's watch, HP's R&D budgets got a 19% haircut. This happened between 2008 and 2010, at the start of the smartphone and tablet booms that reshaped the technology sector. I can't come up with a worse time to step on the innovation brakes.Oracle founder and then-CEO Larry Ellison welcomed Hurd to his new digs with open arms. Immediately installed as co-COO and president with Safra Catz, Hurd quickly became a public face for the company. Hurd's official profile gives him oversight of Oracle's global field operations, including both strategy and day-to-day operations.The woman behind the curtainI don't think that's what's actually going on at Oracle. Peel back the corporate veils, and I think you'll find Safra Catz pulling far more strings than Mark Hurd.Larry Ellison has been grooming her for the CEO role since time immemorial. ""If I dropped dead tomorrow, Safra Catz would be the CEO of Oracle,"" Ellison proclaimed in 2005. That tight connection was always clear to other insiders, too. ""There's no difference between Safra and Larry,"" said senior Oracle executive Mark Barrenechea in 2006. ""One's just at the microphone and the other is behind the curtain.""The twin-CEO situation is an illusion that lets Catz focus on the real work of leading the company. Hurd is a charismatic smokescreen, and a helper for the nitty-gritty detail work. In everything but title and compensation, I'd call him a chief operating officer that answers to Catz in matters of true strategy.The current setup lets Catz continue her behind-the-scenes role, giving Mark Hurd the microphone for the glitzy public relations stuff. Meanwhile, Ellison himself remains a large presence at Oracle, serving as chief technology officer and executive chairman. He was always close friends with Hurd, but nothing like the ""business twins separated at birth"" relationship he has with Catz. So this is also a great way for Larry to keep his finger very directly on the company's everyday pulse.SAFRA CATZ AND MARK HURD, AS SHOWN ON ORACLE'S INVESTOR RELATIONS PAGES. IMAGE SOURCE: ORACLE.The role division also shows up in Oracle's public communications. Take Safra Catz's official profile, for example: at 103 words, it's a study in minimalism. You get all her salient facts -- titles, career highlights -- but nothing more.By contrast, Hurd's profile includes a job description, several personal quotes, and you almost expect a picture of the family dog. It's an entirely different kind of presentation, and it makes Hurd much more of a public figure than Catz. And I think that's exactly the way everyone involved wants it.The situationSo Mark Hurd may look like the face of Oracle to the uninitiated, but I'd propose that it's actually a huge smokescreen. Larry Ellison still sets the strategic direction from his chairman's seat, and Safra Catz executes that vision to perfection -- as always. If Ellison disappeared tomorrow, Catz's vision wouldn't be much different. And she appears perfectly fine with making Hurd the corporate spokesman and official go-getter.It lets her get on with the real work, you know."
New Elon Musk Bio: An Up-Close Look at the Billionaire's Extreme Ambition,"May 14, 2015 at 6:08PM","SOURCE: AUTHOR.The biggest takeaway from technology journalist Ashlee Vance's new biography, Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, is clear: The South African-born self-made billionaire's ambition will stop at nothing. But what really makes this tale of drive so interesting is Musk's track record to date. He's the man behind PayPal, Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA), SpaceX, and SolarCity (NASDAQ:SCTY). Vance's take on Musk gives readers an unbiased glimpse into the entrepreneur's undeniable success in some of the world's toughest industries for start-ups.Ahead of the book's release on May 19, here are some of the most intriguing excerpts.The PayPal MafiaWhile Musk made his first fortune from an early start-up called Zip2, it was at PayPal that the entrepreneur first showed his ability to challenge a complex industry already set in its ways.Musk's central role as co-founder of PayPal shouldn't be overlooked. In retrospect, the PayPal history is evidence of Musk's unquestionable genius at rallying talented individuals around a big goal and making things happen.PayPal also came to represent one of the greatest assemblages of business and engineering talent in Silicon Valley history. Both Musk and [Peter] Thiel had a keen eye for young, brilliant engineers. The founders of start-ups as varied as YouTube, Palantir Technologies, and Yelp all worked at PayPal. Another set of people -- including Reid Hoffman, Thiel, and [Roelof] Botha -- emerged as some of the technology industry's top investors. PayPal staff pioneered techniques in fighting online fraud that have formed the basis of software used by the CIA and FBI to track terrorists and of software used by the world's largest banks to combat crime. This collection of super-bright employees has become known as the PayPal Mafia -- more or less the current ruling class of Silicon Valley -- and Musk is its most famous and successful member.Musk's uncanny ability to build successful organizations hit new levels after PayPal.""During a time in which clean-tech businesses have gone bankrupt with alarming regularity, Musk has built two of the most successful clean-tech companies in the world,"" Vance writes. ""The Musk Co. empire of factories, tens of thousands of workers, and industrial might has incumbents on the run and has turned Musk into one of the richest men in the world, with a net worth around $10 billion.""TESLA FACTORY IN FREMONT, CALIFORNIA. SOURCE: TESLA MOTORS.Musk's track record suggests his lofty goals are achievableVance goes beyond simply laying out Musk's track record. His portrait of Musk shows just how crucial the entrepreneur was to the major achievements behind every start-up he was involved with. Going even further, Vance's report of Musk led him to believe PayPal's achievements might have been limited by a cautious board of directors who had trouble wrapping their minds around Musk's unbridled ambition.""History has demonstrated that while Musk's goals can sound absurd in the moment, he certainly believes in them and, when given enough time, tends to achieve them,"" Vance argues.Some of Musk's current visions that are often criticized as overly optimistic include:At Tesla, where Musk is CEO, he wants to sell 500,000 vehicles per year by 2020, up from management's target to sell just 55,000 vehicles this year.At SpaceX, the other company where Musk is currently CEO, he wants to put a man on Mars in 10 years.Combining Tesla's new battery storage business and the solar panel operations at SolarCity, where Musk serves as chairman, Musk wants to catalyze a global transition to sustainable energy.Sparking a new level of innovation in Silicon ValleyAfter studying Musk, Vance believes that the entrepreneur is playing a key role in pushing Silicon Valley toward greater innovation and more meaningful work.Vance describes a lull in Silicon Valley between 2002 and 2007:Between Google and Apple's introduction of the iPhone in 2007, there's a wasteland of ho-hum companies. And the hot new things that were just starting out -- Facebook and Twitter -- certainly did not look like their predecessors -- Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Sun Microsystems -- that made physical products and employed tens of thousands of people in the process. In the years that followed, the goal went from taking huge risks to create new industries and grand new ideas, to chasing easier money by entertaining consumers and pumping out simple apps and advertisements.SPACEX CREW DRAGON SPACECRAFT, DESIGNED TO TAKE ASTRONAUTS TO AND FROM SPACE. IMAGE SOURCE: SPACEX.But Musk's bold vision and willingness to take risks, paired with surprisingly robust execution, in the automotive, space, and energy industries, Vance explains, set a new precedent.'To me, Elon is the shining example of how Silicon Valley might be able to reinvent itself and be more relevant than chasing these quick IPOs and focusing on getting incremental products out,' said Edward Jung, a famed software engineer and inventor. 'Those things are important, but they are not enough. We need to look at different models of how to do things that are longer term in nature and where the technology is more integrated.' The integration mentioned by Jung -- the harmonious melding of software, electronics, advanced materials, and computer horsepower -- appears to be Musk's gift. Squint ever so slightly, and it looks like Musk could be using his skills to pave the way toward an age of astonishing machines and science fiction dreams made manifest.Of the many profiles of business leaders, Vance's take on Musk is among the best. The author's objective and unbiased viewpoint captures Musk's good and bad, his achievements and failures. Based on more than 30 hours of conversations with Musk, and interviews with close to 300 people, this investigative biography captures many facets of the inventor and entrepreneur. Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future should be required reading for anyone in business.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

7 Things I Learned From Attending the World's Largest 3D Printing Conference,"Apr 25, 2015 at 10:32AM","THIS CAMARO WAS DECORATED WITH 3D-PRINTED DESIGNS BY ARTIST IOAN FLOREA TO HIGHLIGHT THE INTERSECTION OF ART AND TECHNOLOGY. Last week, I had the opportunity to attend Inside 3D Printing in New York City, the largest stand-alone 3D printing conference in the world. More than 12,000 people attended, which represented a three-fold increase in attendance from the year before.During the conference, I interviewed 3D printing executives, attended keynote presentations, and walked the exhibition halls. Here's what I learned from the experience.1. The real money to be made in 3D printing will be from producing 3D-printed parts for final products.Although 3D printing is most often associated today with being a prototyping technology that allows users to iterate designs quickly and affordably, 3D-printed parts for final products will likely continue to make up an increasingly greater percentage of the overall industry's revenue.According to Wohlers Associates, 3D-printed parts for final products increased by 66% annually in 2014, nearly double the industry's 35.2% overall growth rate for the year, and they represented about 43% of the industry's total $4.1 billion in worldwide revenue.Looking ahead, companies in the business of supporting 3D-printed parts that end up inside final products with hardware, services, and materials appear to be in the best position to benefit from this growing opportunity.2. The way to a venture capitalist's wallet is through a successful Kickstarter campaign.After attending several keynotes about the venture capitalist's perspective on 3D printing, it became evident that launching crowdfunding campaigns through sites like Kickstarter has become a popular way for start-ups to validate their takes on 3D printing. If a start-up experiences success in the crowdfunding arena, it can attract interest from the VC community -- and also give itself a bargaining chip in negotiating investment terms.3. HP wants to create a major step-change in 3D printing.During Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) keynote presentation, the 2D printing giant highlighted that it has tremendous experience with digitizing analog and cumbersome technologies. HP told a story about how it invented a digital printing press that can print as little as one book to tens of thousands of books, without ever wasting a page or skipping a beat. This innovation fundamentally changed the publishing world in terms of inventory management and allowed more books to be kept in print.Ultimately, HP wants to leverage its experience in creating a step-change in publishing and apply it to creating a step-change in 3D printing, so that the technology captures a greater percentage of its potential addressable market.According to J. Scott Schiller, worldwide director of HP 3D Printing, there's an order-of-magnitude difference between current 3D printing adoption rates and potential 3D printing adoption rates. In Schiller's view, hundreds of thousands of enterprises could be adopting 3D printing but haven't yet.The heart of HP's 3D printing vision entails creating a 3D printing technology platform that, over time, becomes faster, produces higher-quality parts, operates at a lower cost, and is highly predictable for engineers. In other words, HP's entrance in late 2016 with a technology it's calling Multi Jet Fusion, which it claims is at least 10 times faster than leading technologies on the market today, is likely only a starting point for the company to make greater advances.4. The industrial 3D printing segment may not have much mainstream visibility, but it's the most important part of the industry today.Although the sub-$5,000 consumer 3D printing segment gives 3D printing high visibility and raises awareness of the technology in general, behind the scenes, industrial 3D printers make up the majority of the industry's hardware sales in dollar terms. According to Wohlers Associates, industrial 3D printers priced higher than $5,000 represented about 8% of all 3D printers sold in 2014, but in terms of revenue, it represented nearly 87% of total 3D printer sales worldwide.5. Metal 3D printing continues to be a high-growth area of the industry.Wohlers noted that the metal 3D printing industry, in terms of units, grew by 54.7% annually in 2014, and in total, 543 metal 3D printers were shipped throughout the year. This growth suggests that metal 3D printing is becoming more widely accepted as a viable option for one-off and lower-volume manufacturing applications. As manufacturers figure out new applications for metal 3D printing, it's reasonable for investors to expect this trend to continue growing in the years ahead.6. Material prices will have to come down for adoption rates to increase.I spoke with various 3D printing industry insiders about a central challenge that's bottlenecking adoption rates across the industry: The price of materials, which can fetch upward of hundreds of dollars per kilogram, can be significantly more expensive (orders of magnitude, in some cases) than similar materials used in conventional manufacturing.The collective view I gathered is that material costs will eventually have to decrease so 3D printing can become more cost-effective than traditional manufacturing processes. How this could affect 3D Systems' and Stratasys' razor-and-blade models remains an unanswered question for investors.7. Disruption and innovation can come from anywhere, and this factor is really difficult for investors to account for.Since the start of this year, there have been two major 3D printing breakthroughs from entirely new entrants. In January, Voxel8 showed off an electronics 3D printing platform, and more recently, Carbon3D unveiled its proprietary CLIP technology that claims to be orders of magnitude faster than any other major technology on the market today.As a 3D printing investor, the threat and implications of technological disruption from outside competitors is extremely nuanced and difficult to quantify. Staying up to date on the most recent industry developments is the first line of defense in evaluating a potential competitive threat.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The 2014 Apple iCloud Hack: What It Means for the Future of Our Personal Data,"May 11, 2015 at 7:02PM","SOURCE: APPLEHackers enjoyed a banner year in 2014. Target customers had their credit card numbers stolen through a lapse in company security, while an online bug called Heartbleed put many user passwords at risk on major websites. And then there was the very public, and very creepy, personal data breach where hackers gained access to the iCloud accounts of numerous Hollywood celebrities and posted their private photos online.In response, Apple issued a press statement saying it was “outraged” about the incident and that an internal investigation found no specific flaw with the iCloud system -- that it was a “very targeted attack on usernames, passwords and security questions.”While having your bank account information stolen is no walk in the park, the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)iCloud hack hit a different note -- it revealed a growing problem in our ultra-connected world, showing how easily our private information can be made very public.This time it is personal Consider how many photos and videos you have stored on your smartphone, tablet, and computer, compared to even five years ago. Now, consider the fact that all it takes is just one password to access them and that having that one password can often give hackers access to your other accounts as well.Back in 2012, a senior staff writer for Wired had his entire digital identity erased because of a vulnerability in Apple and Amazon password security. The hackers wiped his MacBook, iPhone, and iPad and then deleted his Gmail account (that he had for eight years), only to start posting as him on Twitter.In his case, most of the data was stored on his devices. That is likely because at the end of 2011, just 7% of consumer content was stored in a personal cloud, according to Gartner. By the end of next year, that number will rise to 36%. In a blog post about Internet security, Malwarebytes Labs -- which makes anti-malware products -- said recently:Cloud security is now more important than Desktop security, this is due to the fact that users are uploading tons of personal data like images or documents to ""cloud"" storage.And as we connect more of our daily lives to the network, the stakes are getting even higher. More than just photos and videosWhile we may consider our photos and videos some of our most personal digital content out there right now, that may change very soon. The Internet of Things, or IoT -- where devices connect to the Internet in order to collect and analyze data and automate systems -- will soon become a big part of our lives.Cars that know where we go, thermostats that know when we come home and when we leave, and ingestible medical transmitters that track whether or not we have taken our medication are already part of the IoT. And it is only growing -- by 2020, Cisco Systems estimates there will be 50 billion things connected to the Internet. OUR PERSONAL MEDICATION INFORMATION IS COMING ONLINE MORE EACH DAY. SOURCE: PROTEUS DIGITAL HEALTHAll of this personal data -- previously kept offline -- will need to be secured on the network. And the current lack of IoT security has already caught the attention of the U.S. government.Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show back in January, Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said: In the not too distant future, many, if not most, aspects of our everyday lives will leave a digital trail. That data trove will contain a wealth of revealing information that, when patched together, will present a deeply personal and startlingly complete picture of each of us -- one that includes details about our financial circumstances, our health, our religious preferences, and our family and friends.The following month, the Senate held its first meeting to address the need for more Internet of Things security.These concerns are not unfounded. Right now, tech companies can create inexpensive IoT devices that collect data without much regard to how well that data is protected, whether or not it is encrypted, or how long the company will support software updates to keep the data safe in the future. In fact, according a Hewlett-Packard report released last year, 70% of the most common IoT devices ""contain serious vulnerabilities.""While the Internet of Things is still a new concept for many people, Malwarebytes Labs expects ""A major Internet of Things (IoT) attack in the new year against an Internet connected device that was previously not connected. Take for example a thermostat that can be controlled over the Internet.""So all of our personal data is doomed, right?SOURCE: PIKTOCHARTThe threat is real, and companies know itAdmittedly, all of this talk about hackers and cybersecurity can be a bit overwhelming. But it is not as if the major tech companies of the world do not already know that protecting personal data is extremely important.At a Congressional hearing for IoT security, Doug Davis, vice president of the Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)Internet of Things division, said that security is a key part of its IoT strategy ""and it is fundamental to Intel's roadmap planning.""Intel has teamed up with several other tech companies to build an Internet of Things platform that has security baked in. Cisco, General Electric, Samsung, and others have also joined up with Intel to create the Open Internet Consortium, or OIC. One of their goals is to set up security standards for the Internet of Things. This is just one of many groups working to make open and secure platforms for IoT devices. Of course, there will be more lapses, data breaches, bugs, and direct attacks in the future. And hackers will be even more motivated to steal our information as more of it is stored on cloud networks and collected by Internet of Things devices. But just as with other forms of technology, companies will adapt to new threats, and users will realize the technological benefits outweigh the risks."
2 Server Companies to Invest in Now,"Apr 16, 2015 at 7:04PM","Cloud computing, a seemingly endless number of mobile devices, and the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) have resulted in the availability of an unprecedented amount of data. And as more of the world becomes connected, the volume of information will continue to grow.Of course, collecting all that data and actually utilizing it to make informed business decisions, improve target marketing capabilities, and make our day-to-day lives (presumably) more efficient via IoT are different matters entirely. Housing and analyzing so much information takes tremendous amounts of computing power, much of it cloud-based, and that's where servers enter the picture.Data centers are becoming bigger and more powerful, and we're still in the early stages of assimilating all that information. For investors, that equates to opportunity. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) – already the world's dominant provider of chips for servers – along with up-and-coming server provider Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) are both positioned to reap the rewards of server sales growth.Good news, bad newsBased on its stock price immediately following news of Intel's fiscal 2015 Q1 financial results released April 14, it appeared investors weren't overly impressed. That said, shares soon started heading back up, which is as it should be. Why? Because just as in prior quarters, investors and analysts alike continue to measure Intel by the results of its Client Computing Group, which includes its PC-related sales. The slowing PC market once again hit Intel, with sales in the unit declining to $7.4 billion, an 8% drop compared to 2014's Q1.But CEO Brian Krzanich made it clear from day one of his taking the helm that Intel was moving in a new direction, one that includes IoT, the cloud, and data centers. And in these critical of areas, Intel is performing admirably, and its commanding position in servers in particular bodes well going forward.Intel owns over 90% of today's server chip market, and its 19% year-over-year jump in Data Center revenues last quarter to $3.7 billion is an indication it's not losing its grip in this fast-growing area. Data Center Group sales were up, as were the unit's average selling price, and with the shift to the cloud and IoT gaining steam, Intel stands to continue its domination in this all-important area.Not so little anymoreTo be sure, global server sales are still led by the likes of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) as measured by sheer volume. But according to a report from Gartner, far-and-away the fastest growing domestic provider of servers is Cisco. Like Intel's Krzanich, CEO John Chambers has steered Cisco toward cloud and related solutions, including honing in on the server marketplace.The good news for investors is twofold: (1) One, Chambers' efforts are working, and (2) there remains tremendous upside for Cisco's server growth. IBM's server market share declined 50% in Q4 as measured by revenues year-over-year, HP sales were essentially flat, and both lost market share. Cisco, on the other hand, enjoyed a nearly 20% jump in server revenues and increased its piece of the overall pie to 5.7%, from 2013 Q4's 4.7%.As he has at the beginning of the last several quarterly earnings calls, Chambers alluded to Cisco's ""transformation"" to burgeoning markets like the Internet of Everything (IoE), the cloud, and big data -- among others -- as the driving force behind Cisco's financial performance. And it's working. Revenue and net income both jumped again last quarter, and Cisco also continued its share buyback initiative.To date, Cisco has bought back a whopping 4.4 billion shares -- and here's the really good part -- at an average price of $20.73 a share. On April 14, Cisco shares closed at $27.81. That's the way share buybacks are supposed to work.Creeping up to a 5.5% share of the server market may not get some investors overly excited, but for those with longer-term time horizons, Cisco's relatively small piece of the marketplace today translates to even more potential upside going forward. It's trending in the right direction, and Chambers has Cisco focused on continuing to make inroads in server sales. Like Intel, Cisco also boasts a 3% dividend yield and both are relatively inexpensive compared to their peers, making them two good bets in the fast-growing server market.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why 3D Printing Stocks Had a Horrible 2014,"Jan 11, 2015 at 11:03AM","It's official: 2014 was not a kind year to 3D printing stocks. 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), Arcam (NASDAQOTH:AMAVF), voxeljet (NYSE:VJET), and Materialise significantly underperformed the S&P 500, which returned 11.54% excluding dividends in 2014. Here's what likely made 2014 a horrible year for 3D printing stocks.DDD DATA BY YCHARTS.1. Sky-high valuationsGoing into 2014, 3D printing stocks likely commanded difficult-to-justify valuations, making it hard for many investors to believe they were underpriced relative to their market opportunity. Have a look in the table below at their valuations at the onset of 2014, which could easily be considered richly valued based on historical norms. (Materialise has been omitted because it wasn't a publicly traded company until June 2014.)CompanyTrailing P/EPrice/Sales RatioPrice/Cash Flow3D Systems20817.8357.1StratasysN/A11.7178.6ExOneN/A19.6(38.5)Arcam 17320.2131.9 voxeljet* N/A 38.3(272.6) SOURCES: MORNINGSTAR, YAHOO! FINANCE. *AUTHOR'S CALCULATION.2. Disappointing earningsIn one way or another, the majority of 3D printing stocks disappointed on Wall Street expectations in 2014; coupled with the sector's lofty valuations, it seems likely that this was a major contributor to the space suffering a down year.3D Systems and voxeljet were among the most guilty of this offense -- both missed earnings expectations three quarters in a row -- but ExOne wasn't far behind thanks to its ongoing transition that continued to drag on earnings results while it refocuses its efforts from targeting metal foundries to targeting the foundries' customers. Stratasys, which executed better than 3D Systems in terms of meeting earnings expectations, was punished for lowering its earnings guidance in November. Thus far, Arcam has delivered mixed results in 2014, but finished its third quarter on a positive note.3. Changes in sentimentIn 2014, various media outlets and Wall Street analysts began to question the meteoric rise that 3D printing stocks experienced in 2013, and this more critical portrayal may have tempered investor enthusiasm toward the sector. Barron's even ran a cover story that exclaimed, ""Beware 3-D Printing!,"" citing the potential dangers of investing in the space, while CNBC rounded up a host of analysts who were bearish on the sector. Compounding the issue further, during 2014, four analysts formally downgraded 3D Systems' stock, one downgraded Stratasys', and one downgraded ExOne. In all, the collective negativity surrounding 3D printing may have helped drive short interest largely higher across the sector.DDD PERCENT OF SHARES OUTSTANDING SHORT DATA BY YCHARTS.4. Increasing competitionInvestors had to more seriously consider the threat of increasing competition in 2014, thanks to a host of patents around key 3D printing technologies expiring and deep-pocketed players making their plans to enter the space known. Specifically, patents around stereolithography and selective laser sintering 3D printing technologies have expired in 2014, and in both instances it has invited new competition that's often willing to democratize access to technologies that are typically reserved for higher-end systems and applications.Hewlett-Packard's recent announcement that it plans to enter the 3D printing space in 2016 with a homegrown technology it's calling Multi Jet Fusion, which it claims is up to 10 times faster than current-generation selective laser sintering and material jetting technologies, may also have made investors worried. After all, HP brings decades of experience manipulating droplets, an expertise it's using as the foundation of Multi Jet Fusion, and some industry experts have already gone on record praising HP's upcoming offering.Taking a step backOver the last three years, shares of 3D Systems and Stratasys -- the only publicly traded 3D printing stocks at the time -- have outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin, suggesting that 3D printing stocks are a highly volatile space and that performance can vary widely from year to year. It also appears that having a long-term time horizon when approaching a highly volatile sector like 3D printing could be valuable to investors.DDD DATA BY YCHARTS.Going back five years yields even better results for investors and potentially reinforces the value of having a long-term time horizon and being patient:DDD DATA BY YCHARTS.Looking aheadInstead of trying to predict where 3D printing stocks will finish in 2015, which I think is a futile exercise, investors are likely better served monitoring how the underlying businesses behind 3D printing stocks are faring. Ultimately, underlying business performance is almost certain to hold a major influence over a corresponding stock's long-term performance. From a long-term perspective, as long as the underlying business fundamentals of a 3D printing stock remain intact, there's little reason to consider selling.  "
A Billionaire's Warning on Index Funds,"Mar 30, 2015 at 12:07PM","Index funds revolutionized the investing world. Built on the idea that markets are efficient and the best way to outperform is to reduce costs, index funds have grown to manage trillions of dollars in assets.In fact, nearly one in every five dollars invested in stock funds is invested in an index fund, up from less than one in every 10 dollars in the year 2000. There are a number of reasons why: Investors are becoming more aware of costs, exchange-traded funds (of which the majority is indexed) are booming, and ongoing fee wars have made index funds more competitive than ever with their actively managed peers.But there is a cost to low costsAt the annual Daily Journal meeting last week, Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's right-hand man at Berkshire Hathaway, fired a warning on the rapid rise of index funds: ""Index funds will be permanent owners who can never sell. That will give them power they are not likely to use well.""Other notable investors, like legendary value investor Mario Gabelli, similarly contend that index funds weaken corporate governance. Index fund managers rarely vote against incumbent management teams. In fact, it became headline news in 2013 when index manager Vanguard voted against directors at Hewlett-Packard in a sign of just how rare it is for indexes to take an active stance.Index funds merely track an index. They don't make active stock picks; rather, they buy or sell stocks simply to match the holdings of the index they seek to track. And the indexes, like the popular S&P 500 index, are not actively managed. The S&P 500 index primarily weighs its holdings by their market capitalization -- the sum of the value of all of a company's outstanding shares. A passive investor's stance on a stock is largely moot when the fund can't buy or sell it.The index influencePut index funds' influence in perspective by looking at Apple, the single largest company in the world by market capitalization. Its top three institutional investors are prominent index fund managers Vanguard, State Street, and BlackRock. Combined, these three institutional owners control 12% of its shares and, naturally, 12% of its proxy votes. That's a lot of power to put in so few hands.Scrolling through Vanguard's votes, you'll find very few occasions in which it voted against management. Fortune noted that Vanguard voted against separating the CEO and board chairman positions, except when management was in favor of the proposal. Certainly, there have to be at least a handful of companies that would be better run if the CEO weren't also the chairman of the board. After all, a board's No. 1 job is to hire and fire a company's CEO. That's a tough call for a board to make when the current CEO attends every meeting.This is largely an industrywide phenomenon. The largest funds don't take an aggressive stance with their proxy votes, which some would say is a direct result of a conflict of interest. Fund managers have a fiduciary responsibility to their investors, but they also want to win the lucrative business of managing corporate retirement plans, which can generate billions of dollars in assets under management from the largest employers. Alas, C-suite executives aren't interested in putting employee savings in funds that will vote against them at the next annual shareholder meeting.Index funds are excellent products. Vanguard is a beautifully designed company, owned by its investors and managed to minimize costs at every turn. But as they grow, index funds will need to be kept in check. As you think about which funds you wish to invest in, look first at fees, but don't ignore funds' form N-PX filings, which detail just how ""activist"" or ""passive"" each fund is when it comes to voting on corporate matters on your behalf. We all lose when fund companies don't take an active role in corporate governance.

3 Ways to Get Free (or Nearly Free) Internet Service,"Mar 21, 2015 at 10:40AM","ORIGINAL PHOTO: FLICKR VIA 401K 2012While options for inexpensive and even free video content have flourished, most would-be cord cutters remain tied to an expensive broadband Internet connection.The major internet service providers, or ISPs, including Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Time Warner Cable (NYSE:TWC), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and AT&T (NYSE:T), have managed to keep the price of this access relatively high. Americans pay a roughly $60-$65 average monthly price for broadband access, according to research from Point Topic conducted in early 2014.It's possible to lower that cost in markets served by more than one provider by shopping around and looking for the best promotional deal. In some cases, it's also possible to get your existing provider to cut your price simply by asking (and showing a willingness to leave for another company).It's also possible to get Internet service for almost nothing and, in limited cases, actually nothing. Here are three ways to do so.1. A tablet with free T-Mobile accessHewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) made a splash last holiday season with its sub-$200 series of Windows laptops and tablets. The company received a lot of press for its HP Stream 7, a 7-inch Windows 8 tablet that costs $99.The 8-inch HP Stream 8 did not receive as much notice, perhaps because it has a $179.99 list price. That seems like a big jump for an extra inch of screen space, but the Stream 8 comes with a huge bonus -- 200 MB of 4G wireless data a month from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), for free, for the life of the device.That's not a lot of data, but it's enough to check email and do some basic Web surfing. What's also nice about the tablet is that once the data allotment is used, T-Mobile offers users the ability to purchase more in inexpensive chunks with no overage charges. Prices vary depending upon how much you buy at a time, but it works out to roughly $2-4 per extra 1GB.The Stream 8, which is the tablet I use when traveling, is a tremendous deal. The free Internet access is not much, but many months it's enough, and when I have had to purchase more, T-Mobile makes it easy.2. Free hot spotsWhile the Stream 8 offers limited free Internet access, that service is specific to that tablet -- it can't be used as a way to connect other devices. However, FreedomPop, an alternative wireless and broadband access provider, actually offers hot spots that come with free Internet access.FreedomPop offers free plans for its mobile hot spots. Actually signing up for the service can be a bit of a challenge as the company's signup pages attempt to street you toward pricier (albeit still very cheap) upgrade packages.Still, it's possible to get a 4G hot spot from the low-cost/no-cost provider with 500MB a month for absolutely nothing. There's no catch, except you have to put a credit card because any overage costs $0.02 a MB. Currently, FreedomPop is even offering an extra 1GB of data per month as an incentive to sign up for its free offer.You do have to pay for the modem hot spot device, however, which allows you to receive the free data. There are a number of choices, all under $100, which is in-line with what higher-priced providers charge.3. Dialing inWhile FreedomPop's plans start at free for high-speed service, NetZero, which offered free dial-up service as far back at the 1990s, will now give customers 10 hours of free dial-up a month. It's not as fast, but the company offers ""thousands of access numbers nationwide,"" which makes it convenient in a pinch.NetZero also has cheap 4G Internet along with a free device which allows users to connect. The company offers data plans starting at 2GB for $19.95 -- not as good as free, but still a decent deal. The company also sells DSL service starting at $11.95 a month.Let's be realisticWhile it's possible to get cut-rate and even limited free Internet access, there is no magic service that replaces a traditional ISP without charging you. It's also unrealistic to think that the various free and low-cost Internet options will allow you to play online games, stream video, and do any other bandwidth hogging tasks.While none of the above services equal even a basic traditional Internet connection, all offer internet services nonetheless. Specifically, the Stream 8 and connectivity devices from FreedomPop and Netzero offer reasonable solutions for free, very limited Internet access while traveling.Of course, these options aren't perfect, but the price is right, and all three of these services offer connectivity where traditional connections may not.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3D Printing Companies: What Investors Need to Know,"Jan 4, 2015 at 10:14AM","SOURCE: ONE UP ON WALL STREET. MADE WITH QUOZIO.COM.Legendary investor Peter Lynch wrote this in 1989, and gave the example that when he was growing up, carpeting was one of the hottest things to invest in. At the time, average carpet prices dropped from $28 per yard to $4 per yard, thanks to a new tufting process that drastically reduced the amount of fiber that went into a carpet and technological advances in automated looming -- the process of weaving threads together. According to Lynch, the emergence of lower prices sparked a boom in carpet sales, and the six major carpet producers, which initially grew like gangbusters and earned more money than they knew how to spend, were eventually joined by 200 new competitors that lowered their prices to win over customers. From that point forward, ""nobody made another dime in the carpet business,"" as Lynch put it.Being a 3D printing specialist, I'm beginning to wonder if the 3D printing industry could share a similar fate to what the carpet industry experienced in terms of industry profits -- a necessary component for sustainable long-term investing.Attractive industry growth rates? Check!According to Wohlers Report 2014, a comprehensive report on the state of the 3D printing industry in 2013, the industry is expected to grow by over 31% per year between 2013 and 2020, to eventually generate more than $21 billion in worldwide revenue. This forecast represents a 130% increase from Wohlers Report 2013, which called for the 3D printing industry to only generate approximately $9.1 billion in 2020. Wohlers has been tracking the industry for over 20 years, meaning the industry tends to put a lot of weight behind any updates to growth forecasts the company makes.SOURCE: WOHLERS ASSOCIATES, AUTHOR'S CALCULATION.Increasing competition? Check!Although they're not exhaustive, Wohlers has compiled lists of major 3D printing manufacturers, service providers, and 3D software developers, which together give the sense that the 3D printing industry is already crowded with established players. Throw in the prospect of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and the likelihood of countless other lower-profile companies entering the space in the coming years, and it seems probable that competitive pressures could begin to weigh on average selling prices across the industry in the coming years. Echoing this sentiment, research company IDC expects that 3D printing average selling prices will decline through 2017.SOURCE: IDC.The upshot is that IDC also predicts that declining prices will drive higher adoption rates, meaning 3D printing companies could have an opportunity to grow their installed bases. As most 3D printing companies utilize a razor-and-blade business model, whereby the printers are the razors and the consumables are the blades, a growing installed base could help them drive larger streams of long-term recurring revenue. Historically, 3D printing consumables have carried a higher gross profit margin than the actual printers, which could help offset potential profitability headwinds as a result of declining printer average selling prices.SOURCE: IDC. IB = INSTALLED BASE.Patent risk? Check!In recent years, a variety of patents related to stereolithography, selective laser sintering, and fused deposition modeling 3D printing processes have expired. In every instance, it invited new competition that democratized access to 3D printing technologies previously reserved for the higher end of the market.On the stereolithography front, Formlabs' $3,299 Form 1+ offers professional-level stereolithography 3D printing in a desktop package -- a technology that can fetch over $100,000 at 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) on the high end. Granted, 3D Systems' high-end stereolithography systems are significantly more capable in terms of use cases than a desktop-oriented 3D printer, but the process itself is fundamentally the same between the Form 1+ and 3D Systems' high-end stereolithography 3D printers. In other words, thanks to patent expirations, stereolithography 3D printing technology is now available for a significantly lower cost.The same could be said on the selective laser sintering front with The OpenSLS project, an open-source selective laser sintering project that developed a working SLS 3D printer for $15,000 -- pennies compared to the more than $500,000 many vendors charge for their high-end SLS systems.And who can forget the birth of the 3D printing maker movement, when patents around Stratasys' (NASDAQ:SSYS) fused deposition modeling expired?In the coming year, additional stereolithography and SLS patents will expire, and although it remains unclear exactly how this will affect the 3D printing industry at large, it seems likely to further democratize access to previously patent-protected 3D printing technologies.The threat of disruption? Check!Compared to traditional manufacturing, 3D printing as a manufacturing process is inferior in terms of speed, surface quality, and the number of applications it can target. Arguably, these shortcomings make the industry ripe for disruption, and the prospect of a breakthrough 3D printing technology rendering existing technologies inferior likely remains high.Aware of 3D printing's shortcomings, HP has plans to enter the space in 2016 with a homegrown technology it's calling Multi Jet Fusion, which it claims is up to 10 times faster than current material extrusion and SLS technologies. Perhaps more important than the implications of HP entering the space and the impact it may have is the reality that there's nothing to stop an innovative 3D printing technology from an external source hitting the market and making other 3D printing companies' technologies appear inferior. Of course, these companies' R&D budgets are aimed at preventing disruption to some degree by developing new technologies and patents, but it isn't a foolproof business strategy.Goodbye, industry profits?The moral of the story is that high-growth industries have a tendency to attract new competition, and when there's enough new competition, it can severely impact industry profits. This is especially true in industries where patents do not sufficiently protect entrenched players.Unfortunately, it's unclear if there will eventually be too much competition in the 3D printing industry for entrenched companies to make sufficient profits over the long term. However, given the industry's strong growth trajectory, likelihood of increasing competition, key patents expiring, and threat of technological disruption, investors shouldn't rule out the possibility that profits may be difficult to come by for 3D printing companies in the long run.After all, robust industry growth has yet to show up on the bottom line -- in the form of profits -- for many publicly traded companies in the space. As a result, 3D printing investors are being promised earnings growth in the future, but let's be clear: Delivering on a promise isn't guaranteed here. In the end, no one knows how this will all play out, and maybe not every area or 3D printing company will be affected by this potential industrywide risk.Investors seeking to gain exposure to the industry and lower the risks outlined in this article could explore focusing on technology-agnostic businesses, like pure-play 3D printing service providers that simply adopt leading technologies rather than manufacture them. This approach could help lower the risks facing more traditional companies, because service providers can simply adapt to changes in the landscape more easily by introducing 3D printing-related services around new technologies. 10 stocks we like better than 3D SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Myth-Busting IBM's Growth Problem,"Feb 7, 2015 at 10:25AM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) has been taking a beating lately. Shares have tumbled over 15% in the past six months, and criticism has rained down on the company from seemingly every direction. Stagnant revenue and a heavy reliance on share buybacks to drive earnings growth has led some to conclude IBM is falling behind, unable to adapt to a changing world and dependent on financial engineering to grow.There are plenty of arguments being made against IBM these days -- here is why three common ones are wrong.No. 1: IBM does not invest enough in its businessA common argument is that IBM is returning billions of dollars to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends when it should be investing to grow the business.From fiscal 2009 through 2013, IBM spent $63.7 billion on stock repurchases and paid out $17.3 billion in dividends. During that same period, the company spent $21.2 billion on capital expenditures and $14.3 billion on acquisitions.IBM does not return so much money to shareholders, because it is reluctant to invest. The company simply generates far more operating cash flow (roughly $97 billion from 2009 to 2013) than it could possibly put back into its business at a reasonable rate of return, and the result is that much of this cash flow is returned to shareholders.IBM does not seek to grow revenue at all costs, spending billions on questionable acquisitions and initiatives. It could have made some massive purchases over the past five years, greatly boosting revenue. But the return on investment would have almost certainly been abysmal.Huge acquisitions often turn out poorly. Consider Hewlett-Packard, which spent $18.6 billion on such deals over the past five years. The result? Revenue is down 11.5% and net income has fallen a whopping 43% over that period. On top of that, HP was forced to take a massive $18 billion asset impairment charge in 2012 related to its failed acquisitions. IBM has largely avoided these types of disastrous transactions.Investing the amount of money IBM earns each year is easy. The hard part is investing in places where the potential return on investment is exceptional. IBM invests plenty in its business. It is only the company's incredible success in growing its earnings over the past decade, giving it the ability to return billions to shareholders each year, that makes it appear otherwise.No. 2: Earnings growth has been the result of financial engineeringAnother criticism of IBM is that the massive amount of money spent on share buybacks has been the primary driver behind earnings growth over the last decade. It is true that buybacks have boosted earnings per share, but such a claim ignores IBM's margin expansion as it shifted its business model to more profitable segments.Between the end of 2004 and the end of 2014, IBM reduced its share count from 1.7 billion to 995 million. This is a nearly 42% reduction, responsible for a big chunk of EPS growth over the last decade. Had net income remained at 2004 levels, EPS for the company would have grown by about 72% just from the buybacks.But EPS has instead grown by 216% since 2004, thanks also to an 87% increase in net income, driven by a rise in both gross and operating margins. This is not financial engineering. IBM had plenty of cash flow to fund these buybacks, and it paid a reasonable price for its own shares. Here is what IBM's P/E ratio has been over the past decade.IBM P/E Ratio (Annual) data by YChartsParticularly after the financial crisis, IBM got a good deal on its share repurchases, with a P/E ratio in the low-to-mid teens. Plowing cash into its stock made perfect sense. As long as IBM does not take on too much debt to pay for these buybacks, and as long as the share price remains reasonable, the company should be buying back as many shares as it can.No. 3: Debt is piling up thanks to buybacksOn the surface, it looks like IBM has an awful lot of debt sitting on its balance sheet -- $40.8 billion at the end of 2014. This is up from $33.9 billion at the end of 2008.But much of this debt is related to the company's global financing business, which is backed by receivables. Non-GF debt totaled $11.7 billion at the end of 2014, up from $9.6 billion at the end of 2008. That is just a $2 billion increase, despite the tens of billions of dollars spent on share buybacks during that period.IBM has mostly paid for its massive buyback program with cash flow, as well as proceeds from selling off low-margin businesses, not debt. Buybacks have accelerated in recent years, and if IBM keeps up this pace, it might have to raise debt to pay for the program. But as it stands, the balance sheet is strong.There is nothing wrong with repurchasing stock if the price is right, and there is money to pay for it. Both conditions have been true for IBM, and a depressed stock price means the company gets more for its money with each share. And the idea that IBM should spend less on its own shares and more on acquisitions is misguided. Its aversion to expensive purchases of hot tech companies, which often trade at many times sales with little or no profit, is a good quality. The day IBM adopts that kind of strategy is the day that I reconsider being an IBM shareholder.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why We're Not Excited About These 4 High-Growth Stocks,"Jan 27, 2015 at 7:00PM","At one time or another, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) were all darlings of Wall Street. Some investors may still view these high-growth stocks in a bullish light. However, we asked three Foolish contributors to explain why they believe the road ahead will be a bumpy one for these once high-flying growth companies.Alex Planes (Stratasys and 3D Systems): My colleagues have both made choices I agree with, but luckily, there's no shortage of overhyped high-growth market darlings. Two of those, 3D printing twin titans Stratasys and 3D Systems, have absolutely trounced the market's performance since the rebound began in 2009:SSYS DATA BY YCHARTS.These two 3D printing companies followed the classic pattern of bubble stocks during the post-crisis era so closely that the only people who should be surprised by 2014's 3D printed collapse are those who have never seen a bubble stock before.The bubbles had realistic underpinnings (3D printing is an important new technology) that led to a marketwide mass delusion (3D printing will change the world tomorrow!) that broke once it became clear that neither Stratasys nor 3D Systems were actually building stronger financial positions as they consolidated the industry. To date, despite a year of backsliding, neither stock's growth since the start of the rebound is remotely in line with revenues:SSYS DATA BY YCHARTS.Internet stocks suffered a similar fate 15 years ago, and the lesson there is valuable. Plenty of dot-com stocks are gone forever, and few of those that are still around have ever recaptured their former heights. Why? For one thing, most of them wound up eclipsed by better companies with stronger technology.Stratasys and 3D Systems have attempted to avoid the dot-com curse by simply buying up competitors, but companies with a legitimate technological edge are not biting the buyout hook too eagerly. A number of core 3D printing patents have already expired or are due to expire soon, and while 3D Systems and Stratasys bulls will tell you this doesn't really matter, it has massive implications for both companies because neither can hope to match interested mega-corporations like Hewlett-Packard or General Electric in R&D investment once it's time to develop the next generation of 3D printing technologies.There's nothing wrong with being bullish on a technology, whether it's the Internet or 3D printing, while also recognizing that today' leaders in that technology could well end up in tomorrow's scrap heap.Tim Brugger (Twitter): Fans of Twitter will no doubt point out that its stock price is up nearly 10% year to date, which is certainly worth getting excited about. But therein lies one of Twitter's problems for investors: Its stock price is all over the board, ranging from a low of $29.51 to a high over $67 a share in the last 52 weeks alone. The bigger problem is what's driving the tweet-master's wild stock ride.Continued shake-ups of Twitter's senior management, CEO Dick Costolo reneging on his promise to not sell his holdings -- he shed 500,000 share just a few months after saying he wouldn't -- and continued concerns involving slowing user growth and engagement are not what investor's should expect from a company in a high-growth phase. But that's exactly where Twitter finds itself.Adding insult to injury, there's also the not-so-small matter of Costolo and co-founder Evan Williams clearly not working from the same playbook. Williams, you may recall, went on record lamenting all the talk about monthly average users (MAUs) as a measuring stick just weeks after Costolo spent most of his presentation at Twitter's first-ever analyst day discussing how he was going to ramp-up MAUs and enhance engagement. Apparently, Williams must have missed Costolo's presentation.As it stands, Twitter will continue to be volatile until it can demonstrate significant improvement in key areas such as MAU growth and engagement. A high-growth stock undergoing these particular problems this early in its life cycle? That's not the kind of excitement most investors want.Jamal Carnette (GoPro): For me, the key word is ""excited."" And by that definition, my choice is GoPro. On one hand, the stock is among the most-shorted stocks on the Nasdaq, and on the other hand, it is one of the biggest ""cult stocks"" -- stocks people own because they love the product more so than the underlying investment. Considering the latter exists, it is entirely possible this company has a long runway for growth with its action cameras.That said, I'm unsure of the total addressable market for a single-product-focused consumer-electronics company in the long term. In an ironic twist, the clever niche that propelled the company to the top of the action-camera market will eventually limit its continued growth without the introduction of new products. And even after the company's market capitalization dropped from more than $11 billion to $6.5 billion, the company still trades at valuations reserved for social media companies rather than consumer-electronics companies.This is because the company has been playing up its social-media ambitions, but it hasn't produced any meaningful revenue from social media yet. And even when it starts to monetize its users' videos, there's no guarantee it will ever develop the meaningful scale that shareholders desire at these premium valuation levels. In the end, I could be totally wrong, and the young company could grow into its lofty valuations -- as it is clearly growing -- but I'll gladly watch this story from the sidelines. 10 stocks we like better than 3D SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

How to Use the P/B Ratio,"Jan 23, 2015 at 4:36PM","BOOK VALUE DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN WHAT IT SEEMS TO.How much should you pay for a stock? There are nearly as many answers to that question as there are people buying stocks.Some will tell you a stock's price should be tied to its earnings (the P/E ratio). Others sing the praises of price to sales (the P/S ratio). But Benjamin Graham, the ""father of value investing,"" argued that investors are best advised to use a combination of approaches. For example, one might buy stocks that sell for P/E ratios of less than 15, but only when their prices are also less than 1.5 times their book value (a 1.5 P/B ratio).Just about everyone has heard of the P/E ratio. But what is a P/B ratio, and how do you figure it out?The short answer is that you can find a stock's P/E and P/B ratios -- and its P/S ratio, too, for that matter -- by looking the stock up here on Fool.com and clicking on its ""Stats"" tab -- here's Hewlett-Packard's stats page, for example.The long answerFor those looking to learn more about this metric, the longer answer is that you calculate a stock's P/B thus:P/B ratio = market capitalization / book value of equityIf that looks like nonsense to you, let's break it down further:Market capitalization = shares outstanding x share priceBook value of equity = book value of assets - book value of liabilitiesTherefore the P/B ratio is = market cap / (BV of assets-BV of liabilities)Now that I've got it, what do I do with it?The upshot of all that math is this: A stock's ""book value"" is the value of its assets (its cash, accounts receivable, real estate, and so on) minus its liabilities (its debts, accounts payable, and other financial obligations). And the stock's P/B ratio is the difference between how much the stock costs on the stock market and its book value.Generally speaking, if the P/B is greater than 1.0, the stock costs more than the business it represents. Conversely, if a stock sells for a P/B of less than 1.0, then you can buy the stock for less than what it would cost to rebuild the company from the ground up.It's not the final wordSo should you ever buy a stock where the book value is greater than 1.0? The answer is yes, for a number of reasons:Stocks rarely sell for a P/B ratio of less than 1.0. A quick scan of the markets through Finviz.com's stock screener reveals that, out of nearly 7,000 listed stocks on the market, barely one-in-seven carry a P/B ratio of less than 1.0. If you bought only stocks that meet this criterion, you'd be ignoring 85% of the market -- which includes some great companies.Book value may not mean what you think it does. If a company's assets have a long service life (e.g., buildings, factories, land), accountants may have depreciated their value over time to near-zero on the balance sheet -- even though the assets still have years of useful life (and value) ahead of them. Or a long-lived asset may simply be assigned the book value of the price paid to acquire it. Land, for example, is usually ""booked"" at its purchase price, despite the fact that land generally appreciates in value over time. In an extreme case, like tree farm Plum Creek Timber (NYSE:PCL), trees grow, so their real value moves in an opposite direction of depreciation.Some assets are hard to value. Other companies (such as tech firm Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)) may have most of their value tied up in intangible intellectual property, which is tough to quantify on a balance sheet. This may prevent it from showing up as accurate ""book value,"" making the stock's P/B ratio look higher than it perhaps should.In short, a ""high"" P/B ratio isn't always bad. But by the same token, a low book value isn't always good, either.The trouble with a low P/B ratioIn a nutshell, the problem with assuming that a low P/B ratio signals a ""cheap stock"" is this: If the book value is inflated, your money isn't buying as much as you think. This could be the situation if, for example:Your target company loves to buy other companies. Let's use Microsoft as an example again. Over the past three decades, Microsoft has made well over 100 acquisitions of other companies -- often at high prices -- including aQuantive ($6.3 billion), Nokia ($7.2 billion), and Skype ($8.5 billion). Some of these acquisitions are working out. Others aren't. But all had to be recorded on the company's balance sheet at the price Microsoft paid for them. If it overpaid for money-losing technology, then that book value may not be worth what it seems. Time changes things. Ultimately, a company that overpaid to acquire another company may be forced to confess its mistake in future years, taking a ""charge to earnings"" and writing down the book value of the acquisition. When that happens, hundreds of millions of dollars worth of book value that you thought the company had simply...vanishes. And the low P/B ratio that first attracted you? That skyrockets. Rule No. 1: Use common senseWhen you think about it, this is all common sense. If a company has a high P/B ratio, but people continue to happily pay that price on the stock market, there's probably a reason -- e.g., there may be value in the company that doesn't show up as book value.Conversely, if anyone could look at a company with a low P/B ratio and know with 100% certainty that it was ""cheap,"" then everyone would do that. They'd buy the cheap stock, bid against each other to own it, and drive the price up to a P/B ratio of 1.0.Presto chango, the stock would not be cheap anymore.So how should you use the P/B ratio? When you get right down to it, you should use it just as Benjamin Graham advised: As one tool to be used alongside other tools, such as P/S and P/E.

"Watch Out, 3D Systems and Stratasys -- Carbon3D's Super-Speedy 3D Printing Tech Just Snagged a $10 Million Investment","Apr 13, 2015 at 12:30PM","Carbon3D made a splash onto the technology world stage when CEO Joseph DeSimone unveiled and demonstrated the company's seemingly game-changing 3D printing technology, Continuous Liquid Interface Production, or CLIP, at the TED 2015 conference in mid-March.  Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) was apparently one of those wowed by this breakthrough technology, which harnesses ultraviolet light and oxygen to rapidly ""grow"" parts. The leading 3D printing software maker announced on Thursday that it's backing Carbon3D with a $10 million investment from its Spark Investment Fund. This is Autodesk's first investment since it launched the fund in August with the aim of investing up to $100 million in those pushing the boundaries of 3D printing.SOURCE: CARBON3D.Raising money at a rapid CLIPPerhaps fittingly for a company that claims its CLIP technology is 25 to 100 times faster than leading 3D printing technologies, Carbon3D has been raising money at a fast clip. It's now raised $51 million, as it had previously secured $41 million in private equity funds from tech heavyweights Sequoia Capital and a division of Silver Lake.The start-up has considerable resources to continue developing its innovative CLIP technology. This, of course, makes it a more formidable potential competitor to 3D printing industry leaders 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS).3D Systems had $284.9 million sitting on its balance sheet at the end of the fourth quarter 2014, while Stratasys had a cash hoard of $442.7 million. Though Carbon3D's funding doesn't compare to the cash positions of the two industry bigwigs, it's still a big take for a start-up that just began operating in 2013.While we're talking war chests, Hewlett-Packard's balance sheet was bulging with $12.9 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. HP's deep pockets are a huge reason the company sent shock waves through the 3D printing space before it even unveiled its impressive Multi Jet Fusion technology. The company plans to release an enterprise-focused 3D printer based on this tech in 2016. Technology imitates artThe most compelling part of this story to me is that Carbon3D's two co-founders were inspired to develop CLIP by the robotic assassin T-1000 from the movie Terminator 2, which rises from a pool of liquid metal to assume the form of any person or object. SOURCE: WIKIPEDIA.Similarly, objects made using CLIP technology rise from a pool of UV-light-curable resin. The following diagram shows a spherical object being produced; it's a representation of the bouncy elastomer sphere that DeSimone demonstrated being printed while he was giving his TED talk. Amazingly, it took the Carbon3D printer less than 10 minutes to produce the object, which was about the size of a large Super Ball.SOURCE: CARBON3D.CLIP technology is similar to stereolithography, or SLA, which also uses UV light to selectively cure resin as it produces an object layer by layer. SLA was invented by Chuck Hull, who then went on to found 3D Systems.However, unlike SLA, which pauses between each layer, CLIP operates continuously, as its name -- Continuous Liquid Interface Production -- suggests. This accelerates the 3D printing process to speeds 25 to 100 times as fast as leading 3D printing technologies. Additionally, it results in printed objects that have a smoother surface finish than conventionally 3D-printed parts, and a structural integrity on par with injection molded parts, according to Carbon3D. Eliminating the pauses involved an entirely new way of conceptualizing 3D printing. As DeSimone explained in his TED talk, oxygen has traditionally had a bad name with respect to UV-light-sensitive resin because it inhibits curing. Inspired by T-1000, however, CLIP's inventors turned the thought process upside down so that oxygen is key to making the technology work.Through the use of a transparent, oxygen-permeable window that DeSimone likened to a contact lens, CLIP technology controls the exposure of light and oxygen to the resin. The UV light solidifies some parts of the resin, while the oxygen prevents other parts -- the ""dead zone"" -- from solidifying. This process allows the object to ""grow"" from the bottom up in a continuous process. Wrap-upWhile 3D printing stock investors shouldn't panic, they should also not underestimate the potential of well-funded Carbon3D's CLIP technology to take business away from their 3D printing companies, most notably 3D Systems, Stratasys, and voxeljet, all of which are involved in the plastics space. The extent of the threat, however, remains unknown at this point, as we don't yet have enough information, particularly on Carbon3D's materials capabilities.  Unless DeSimone has magical powers on par with T-1000's, his live demonstration showed that CLIP is a potentially game-changing technology with respect to speed. And given Carbon3D's backers, it seems highly likely that the company's others claims are also accurate.If this proves to be the case, then CLIP technology has the potential to disrupt the manufacturing industry. That's because speed, surface quality, and structural integrity -- in addition to materials capabilities -- are key hurdles that have been holding 3D printing back from moving beyond prototyping and select, short-run production applications into a greater array of manufacturing applications."
Why Investors are Short-Selling TASER International Inc. Stock,"Apr 22, 2015 at 1:00PM","As TASER International's (NASDAQ: TASR) share price has risen over the past year a growing number of investors have questioned the company's value.Short-sellers, who are betting a stock will lose value, have increased the numbers of shares they've sold short. The short interest has now reached 13 million shares out of 53.1 million shares outstanding. Why are so many investors down on the stock?TASR DATA BY YCHARTS.What goes up must go downOne reason investors might be betting against TASER'S shares is that they have become much more expensive over the past year. In 2014, the company made just $19.9 million in profit, giving the stock a P/E ratio of 79.That's expensive for any stock, and TASER's argument is that it is giving up profit now to grow quickly and generate more profit later. With revenue up 20.1% in 2013 and 19.4% in 2014 it looks like growth investments are paying off, but that hasn't had a major impact on the bottom line yet.Short-sellers are betting that either Taser's growth won't reach the market's lofty expectations or that margins, and thus profit, won't be high even if revenue does exceed expectations.How much will TASER's business grow?One question investors should consider is how much TASER International would need to grow to live up to investors' expectations.I like to assume a stock will eventually have to reach a P/E ratio of 10 because today we could find slow or no-growth stocks that trade for a similar P/E ratio like Best Buy (NYSE: BBY), National Oilwell Varco (NYSE: NOV), or Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ). If we assume TASER International can generate a 13% net margin -- an average of its margin the last three years -- the company would need $1.21 billion in annual sales to reach a P/E of 10.Given constant growth of 20% per year -- roughly its level over the last two years -- TASER would need 11 years to live up to its valuation.These are back of the napkin calculations, but you can see why investors might be wary of the company ever living up to the stock's current valuation.Competition could be comingTASER International's strong margins could eventually come under pressure as well. Tasers and body-worn cameras have just started to become popular for law enforcement agencies, and we have yet to see how larger competitors could react to this development. Any number of tech and protective equipment manufacturers could participate in this market if they desired. If TASER's market grows big enough it could become a target.Competition could lead to disappointing growth versus what I pointed out above and to lower margins as well. This threat of competition could be another reason investors have shorted the stock.Is this a stock to consider shorting?High-growth stocks such as TASER can be tempting for short-sellers, but they come with a lot of risk as well. The market can push stocks higher for almost no reason and growth could exceed expectations, sending the stock surging.Plus, TASER International is a leader in a growing business. Just 2,500 police agencies have purchased Axon body mounted cameras compared to 18,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide. The U.N. has estimated that there are 300 law enforcement officers per 100,000 people around the world, indicating that 21 million people are in law enforcement. With 110,000 cameras sold, TASER International has a large market opportunity ahead. I think there are too many factors working in TASER's favor, and with so many investors already short there's a risk the opportunity to short the stock has passed. I would not short this stock; in fact, I'm betting the other way on TASER International."
What's Wrong With Hewlett-Packard Company's Cost-Cutting Obsession? (Hint: Everything),"Sep 17, 2015 at 9:20AM","IMAGE BY THE AUTHOR, BASED ON ORIGINAL MATERIALS FROM HP.As Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) gets ready to split into two separate businesses, the company is getting its ducks in a row. On Tuesday night, at the end of HP's yearly analyst day, management published financial guidance sheets for both the consumer-minded HP and the business-oriented Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.Taken together, the separation is expected to boost HP's annual free cash flows by something like 30%. The main driver of these profit-boosting efficiencies will come from enormous cost-cutting moves in the Enterprise business, removing as many as 30,000 workers from that company's payroll.That's great for HP Enterprise's shareholders in the short run. Savings are savings, even if they undermine the company's innovation and leave the business helpless in the long run. HP shares rose more than 5% on the news, so it's clear that current owners appreciate these moves.Let me just point something out for you.Slicing HP up into two companies opens the door for large headcount reductions. Annual operating costs will dip as much as $2.7 billion lower, which just happens to also be the sum of expected cash flow increases. Makes perfect sense.But we've seen this movie before.Thirteen years ago, HP completed its blockbuster Compaq merger. Back then, CEO Carly Fiorina achieved $2.5 billion of annual cost savings by -- you guessed it -- slashing thousands of names off the combined payroll. Fiorina settled on 15,000 erased positions as the ""appropriate"" cost-cutting level, and the rest is history.Specifically, nothing happened for several years. When Fiorina left the company in early 2005, handing the reins to noted cost-cutting expert Mark Hurd, HP's stalled sales took off like a rocket although cash flows never followed suit. Hurd removed another 15,000 jobs, including large layoffs in the IT operations department and sharp reductions in HP's R&D budgets.HP REVENUE (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.In 2002, HP spent $3.3 billion on research and development, a 26% increase in just two years. That amounted to 5.8% of HP's total revenues.By the end of 2004, R&D budgets had peaked and then backed down to $3.5 billion. That's just 4.3% of HP's annual sales at the time.In 2014, HP still only funneled $3.4 billion into its R&D efforts, or a meager 3% of incoming revenues. In other words, the damage to this famed innovator's corporate culture was made permanent when management paid more attention to immediate bottom-line profits than to long-term sustainability.Long story short, HP's leaders have a 13-year history of wanting their cake and eating it, too. It's beyond me how current CEO Meg Whitman hopes to reap significant cost efficiencies from this split without damaging the two new corporations' research-driven future prospects -- especially since ex-CEO Fiorina made very similar efficiency claims when she combined two large companies instead.As CEO of one company and chairwoman of the other, Whitman gives up very little control over the two-headed business. Meanwhile, she's using the move as a thinly veiled excuse to do more of the obsessive cost-cutting that put HP in a long-term hole to begin with.I still agree that splitting HP up is the right idea, but disagree something fierce with the actual implementation. Once upon a time, I looked forward to this split since it seemed to offer a way back to innovation-driven growth for at least one of the new HP units.In the immortal words of Bob Dylan: Things have changed. I'm now planning to stay away from both HP and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise when they hit the public market in November."
Everything You Should Know About the New HP Inc and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co,"Nov 11, 2015 at 10:41AM","Tech giant Hewlett-Packard recently split into two companies -- HP (NYSE:HPQ) and HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE). HP will sell PCs and printers, while HP Enterprise will sell commercial computer systems, software, and tech services. Former CEO Meg Whitman now leads HP Enterprise, while Dion Weisler, who worked at rivals Acer and Lenovo before joining HP, has become the new HP CEO. HP investors received one share of HP Enterprise for every share of HP.By splitting its business in two, analysts estimate that each half of HP can generate over $50 billion in sales next year. However, some investors are skeptical that the two new companies will fare much better on their own than as a single company. Let's take a closer look at the big split and which half might experience stronger growth.SOURCE: HPChallenges for HPDemand for PCs and printers has been painfully sluggish over the past year. Research firms IDC and Gartner both expect PC sales to remain weak this year before stabilizing next year. According to IDC, HP's worldwide shipments fell 5.5% annually in the third quarter of 2015. In printers, HP was late to enter 3D printing, a rare pocket of growth in the stagnant printer market.During HP's final quarter as a single company, PC sales fell 13% annually to $7.5 billion due to double-digit declines in desktops and workstations. Printer sales fell 9% to $5.1 billion due to a widespread shift toward sharing digital photos and documents online. Sales of higher margin printing supplies dwindled 6% as both commercial and consumer hardware posted double-digit declines. The printing business only generates about 40% of the new HP's sales, but it accounts for nearly 80% of its operating profit due to higher margins than the PC business.Splitting with the enterprise segment should give HP more freedom to boost R&D spending, which only amounted to 3.5% of its revenue last quarter. Without having to consider the needs of the enterprise business, HP can raise its R&D spending to compete more effectively against Lenovo's newer PCs and its rivals in 3D printing. Barron's recently declared that HP shares might climb into the ""high teens"" next year if it can maintain profitability in its printer and computer businesses while boosting shareholder value with dividends and buybacks. HP claims that it will return 50% to 75% of its free cash flow to shareholders with $865 million in dividends and the remainder in buybacks.Challenges for HP EnterpriseMeanwhile, HP Enterprise faces a tough uphill battle in the enterprise market. Last quarter, HP's enterprise services revenue fell 11% annually to $4.98 billion as demand for IT outsourcing, apps, and business services all declined. However, IT hardware revenue inched up 2% to $7.01 billion as stronger demand for x86 servers and networking equipment offset weaker demand for high-end servers, data storage solutions, and tech services.HP Enterprise's earnings look somewhat similar to IBM's. But whereas IBM sold its x86 server business to Lenovo and focused on growing its cloud business, HP sells x86 servers but shuttered its public cloud platform in October. Whitman stated that the business was too capital intensive to compete against established cloud platform leaders. However, HP still intends to maintain a presence in the ""hybrid cloud market"", which combines private and public clouds for companies that aren't ready to move all their data to the public cloud yet. Gartner estimates that about half of all large enterprises will have hybrid cloud deployments by 2017.Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner recently noted that while the services segment still needs to evolve, margin improvements could boost earnings over the next three years as recurring revenue stabilizes its long-term growth. Scriber notes that HP Enterprise's tech services business will grow alongside hardware sales and provide ""a steady recurring revenue and cash flow stream for the company"". Like HP, HP Enterprise plans to return over half of its estimated free cash flow in fiscal 2016 to shareholders, with $400 million in dividends and the rest in buybacks.The road aheadBased on HP's own forward earnings estimates, both HP and HP Enterprise are trading at around eight times forward earnings. Neither company has set exact dividends yet, but the aforementioned free cash flow guidance indicates that HP will pay a higher dividend, estimated to be a 3% to 4% yield at current prices. HP Enterprise should pay a lower dividend and commit more of its free cash flow to buybacks and acquisitions. In other words, HP could be better for dividend investors looking for more stability, while HP Enterprise could be a better choice for more growth-oriented investors. 10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Hewlett-Packard Company Reveals More Spinoff Detail (But Investors Still Need to Know Even More),"Jul 6, 2015 at 11:00AM","ORIGINAL IMAGE SOURCE: HP. EDITED BY THE AUTHOR.Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) just took an important step toward splitting into two new companies. On July 1, the company filed a Form 10 statement with the SEC, in which HP laid out more detail on what the upcoming split will mean for investors.Gentle remindersHP's enterprise operations will become the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co., a separately traded entity with its own management team and balance sheet. Personal systems and printing operations will be known as HP, and get to keep HP's current logo. All of this was known from early announcements and filings, but it's good to see HP sticking to its guns.To avoid taxable events, the separation is structured as a one-time dividend. Some fine day in November 2015, today's Hewlett-Packard shares will get the new HP moniker while also paying out 100% of the freshly printed HP Enterprise stubs. Some spinoffs come alongside complicated stock splits or reverse splits, but the number of HPQ shares will not change. That's not exactly news (or, for that matter, particularly important), but a clarification.HP's current CEO, president, and board chair, Meg Whitman, will control both of the new companies, but from different angles. After the split, Whitman will be CEO and president at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and chairwoman at HP.Here, I was actually hoping for a change since Whitman's incredible workload appears to have been a core reason for the split in the first place. I'm not at all convinced she should be so deeply involved with both companies, and that HP would be better off if Whitman simply took her hands off of HP altogether.New newsNow we also know HP will hang on to the HPQ ticker symbol, while the Enterprise company grabs the HPE symbol. Both stocks will trade via the the New York Stock Exchange, as HP has done since time immemorial. So whether you're interested in buying one of the new HP stocks or selling the half you don't want after the split, you can start planning your trades now with the proper tickers and all.Getting down to financial nuts and bolts, the enterprise business would have generated $55.1 billion of total revenue and $1.6 billion of generally accepted accounting principles earnings in 2014. That's almost exactly half of the full HP package's $111.5 billion in 2014 sales but only 32% of the company's overall profits.The enterprise company brings along $67.4 billion of total assets and $1.5 billion of total debt, leaving $34 billion of assets and $19.6 billion of debt in the hands of the consumer-oriented HP In 2014, the operations destined for HP Enterprise generated $4 billion of free cash flow. HP's printing and consumer systems pulled down the remaining $4.5 billion of HP's $8.5 billion in total free cash flow.So the enterprise business will be a nearly debt-free operation. Leaving most of the debt service to the more profitable of the two operations seems to make sense, although these stats might trade places over the coming years.HP CEO MEG WHITMAN IS SHIFTING GEARS. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.Mystery meatHP left a bit of suspense hanging over the new balance sheets. In an offhand remark, the Form 10 filing notes that ""Hewlett-Packard Enterprise intends to enter into certain financing arrangements prior to or substantially concurrent with the separation.""That's all we know about those ""certain financing arrangements"" at this point. Since the Enterprise business will deal mainly in software development and information-technology services, with a light touch of hardware manufacturing on the side, it is destined to remain lightweight and nimble. Hence, I don't see any serious needs for the enterprise business to raise cash alongside the separation. Whitman might prove me wrong with something like an oddly timed big-ticket acquisition, but that would qualify as an honest-to-goodness surprise move.Final wordsThis is by no means a complete rundown of HP's separation plans. The beefy Form 10 document weighs in at nearly 300 pages, packed with the usual blend of typical boilerplate and investable information.For now, it's clear that Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will become a mirror image of Ginny Rometty's revamped IBM (NYSE:IBM) business. With a heavy focus on software and services, married to a lightweight balance sheet, HP Enterprise might as well have photocopied Rometty's turnaround plan. Yes, HP Enterprise will start its life in a risk-laden turnaround mode. Invest accordingly, if at all.HP might not exactly hit the ground running, but it will at least hobble along at a reasonable pace. PC systems have seen better days, but HP still dominates the highly profitable printing industry. That's enough to create a cash machine, albeit much of the resulting cash flow might go into servicing that large debt load.HP Enterprise looks like a play for the risk takers among us, as Whitman attempts to turn this IT heavyweight around. HP will offer lower risk and probably a larger dividend, and generally act like a safe low-growth investment. You can soon own either one, separate from the other.Would I recommend buying any of these stocks, now or after the split? Not necessarily, given the gaping holes in the published information. HP promised to spill more beans at its annual investor conference in mid-September, and we'll see many more announcements and SEC filings before November.In other words: Hold your horses.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip. Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner and his brother, Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner, just revealed two brand new stock recommendations. Together, they've tripled the stock market's return over the last 13 years.* And while timing isn't everything, the history of Tom and David's stock picks shows that it pays to get in early on their ideas.Click here to be among the first people to hear about David and Tom's newest stock recommendations.*Stock Advisor returns as of April 2, 2018"
Is Hewlett-Packard a Threat to Cisco?,"Jul 10, 2015 at 11:00AM","Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) has long been a distant No. 2 behind Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) in the networking business. Cisco's switches and routers are ubiquitous, with the company's global market share larger than all of its competitors combined, and HP has failed to make much progress against the networking juggernaut.Two separate developments, however, could help HP become more competitive against Cisco. First, HP is set to split itself in two later this year, with the PC and printing businesses being separated from the enterprise operations. HP Enterprise, as the enterprise business will be called, will have ample ammunition for acquisitions since the other company will inherit most of HP's debt, and the new company's narrowed focus should help HP's cause.Second, HP's recent acquisition of Aruba, the No. 2 player in the WLAN market, gives the company a stronger presence in a fast-growing area, and it furthers HP's goal of offering unified networking solutions. Should Cisco be concerned?The networking business as it standsCisco dominates the Ethernet switching market, with a 62.4% market share during the first quarter of 2015. HP is a distant second, managing to win 8.3% of the market during the second quarter. All other competitors are less than half the size of HP. Switching is Cisco's largest source of revenue, accounting for about 29% of the company's total revenue during its latest quarter.In the wireless LAN market, Cisco held a 47.8% market share in the first quarter, growing at roughly the same rate as the market as a whole. HP is a distant fourth in this market, while Aruba managed a 14% market share during the first quarter. Aruba is growing far faster than the market, increasing its WLAN revenue by 20.1% year over year in the second quarter.The combination of HP and Aruba gives HP a much stronger presence in the WLAN market, although Cisco will still have an enormous lead. Combined, HP and Aruba claimed a 17.6% share of the WLAN market in the fourth quarter. Overall, Cisco controlled 48.7% of the enterprise networking equipment market in 2014, while HP had an 8.3% share, and Aruba had just a 1.7% share.A threat to Cisco?By strengthening its position in wireless LAN with the Aruba acquisition, HP will be able to offer unified wired and wireless solutions. And by separating HP Enterprise into its own company, further acquisitions could allow HP to inorganically grow its market share in various networking markets. A full 25% of the WLAN market goes to vendors outside of the top five, for example.The $2.5 billion acquisition of Aruba isn't HP's first networking acquisition. Under former CEO Mark Hurd, HP spent $2.7 billion on 3Com in 2010 in an effort to better compete with Cisco in switching. That move didn't accomplish much; HP's total networking market share has fallen from 10% immediately following the 3Com deal to just 8.3% today.HP doesn't have a great record when it comes to acquisitions. The $25 billion deal for Compaq in 2002, just a few years before IBM exited the PC business completely in what proved to be a prescient move, was a disaster, with HP eventually dropping the Compaq brand entirely. The $1.2 billion acquisition of Palm in 2010 went nowhere, and the $11 billion deal for Autonomy, a company which turned out to be a massive fraud, raised an awful lot of questions about HP's ability to perform due diligence.HP is under new management, and CEO Meg Whitman will serve as CEO of HP Enterprise after the separation, but HP's history of terrible deals is hard to ignore. Even if the Aruba acquisition works out well, Cisco has major advantages that will make it difficult for HP to gain an edge. Switching costs are high, and while Aruba has been growing quickly in the WLAN market, it hasn't been winning market share from Cisco, which is growing its WLAN business at about the same rate as the market.While the story may sound promising, I don't think HP is any bigger of a threat to Cisco than it was prior to the Aruba acquisition and its split into two parts. If HP fails to integrate Aruba successfully, which would not be out of character for the company, it could very well kill Aruba's rapid growth rate. I don't think Cisco has too much to worry about."
Intel Corporation and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. Team Up in the Internet of Things,"Nov 23, 2015 at 7:00PM","Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) recently teamed up to expand into the Internet of Things (IoT) market, which includes connected devices like wearables, smart appliances, and connected cars. The two tech giants will work together to create open standards for IoT devices. They will also create three global ""solutions labs"" to help customers accelerate the deployment of IoT applications, as well as three ""discovery labs"" where companies can test IoT applications and devices.INTEL CEO BRIAN KRZANICH. SOURCE: INTEL.The partnership will combine HPE's IoT and IT solutions with Intel's IoT platform and processors to create new products that ""sit at the edge"" of networks (outside of traditional data centers) to ""collect, process, as well as analyze data from sensors and devices."" These new systems will be powered by Intel's Core i5 and Atom processors. In a press release, Intel IoT Senior VP Doug Davis called the partnership ""the latest example"" of the company's ""growing IoT ecosystem.""What this deal means for IntelIntel, the largest PC and data center chipmaker in the world, is currently fighting Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the biggest mobile chipmaker, to control IoT communication standards with rival consortiums. Intel leads the Open Internet Consortium (OIC), while Qualcomm leads the AllSeen Alliance. Both alliances have major backers, but Qualcomm's list of partners is about twice as long as Intel's.This summer, Qualcomm started working with Thread Group, a communication standard backed by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) that has a comparable number of partners as AllSeen. Thread Group President Chris Boross stated that AllSeen's AllJoyn open source software framework will be compatible with Thread, which would create the largest IoT communication standard in the world. Boross also stated that Thread could also be integrated with Intel's IoTivity framework, but a similar partnership hasn't been announced yet.Intel is relying on its growing IoT business to diversify away from its weaker PC and mobile chip businesses. Last quarter, Intel's IoT revenue rose 10% annually to $581 million and accounted for 4% of its top line. That growth was fueled by rising demand for Atom chips, tiny IoT modules like Curie and Edison, and progress in the wearables market.INTEL'S EDISON. SOURCE: INTEL.Intel's partnership with HPE will further strengthen its IoT presence against Qualcomm on the edge of networks. To ensure that it keeps pace with Qualcomm, Intel recently hired Dr. Venkata Renduchintala, the former executive VP of Qualcomm Technologies, as the president of its newly formed client and IoT business and systems architecture group.What this deal means for HPEAfter splitting with HP, HPE now sells commercial computer systems, software, and business support services. In its final quarter before the split, HP's enterprise revenue fell 11% annually as demand for IT services, apps, and business services all declined. IT hardware revenue rose 2% as demand for x86 servers and networking equipment offset weaker demand for high-end servers, data storage solutions, and tech services.HP shuttered its cloud platform in October and decided to focus HPE's postsplit efforts on ""hybrid cloud"" installations instead. Hybrid cloud installations combine private and public clouds for larger companies that aren't ready to move all their data to the public cloud yet. Research firm Gartner estimates that around half of all large enterprises will use hybrid cloud installations by 2017.HPE's IoT partnership with Intel will likely cast a ""halo effect"" across many of HPE's businesses. HP's services and apps can gather and analyze more data from the network edge. Hybrid cloud installations can also reach further by tethering more IoT devices to private and public clouds.A new market for aging tech titansResearch firm IDC expects the IoT market to grow from $656 billion in 2014 to $1.7 trillion in 2020. That's why ""mature"" tech companies like Intel, HPE, and Qualcomm are all aggressively expanding into the IoT market on multiple fronts. Intel and HPE's partnership is promising for both companies, but the conflict in communication standards with Qualcomm won't likely end anytime soon. That conflict could delay the adoption of a ""universal"" standard for IoT communications while throttling the growth of the overall market."
Is Hewlett-Packard Stock a Good Value?,"Aug 11, 2015 at 2:50PM","Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) stock soared beyond $40 late last year after the company announced it would split in two in 2015. But since then, it's been tough sledding for the tech behemoth. For the past month and a half or so, Hewlett-Packard stock has been stuck near the $30 mark.HEWLETT-PACKARD STOCK CHART, DATA BY YCHARTSThis leaves HP shares trading for just a little more than eight times earnings on both a backward- and forward-looking basis. That certainly seems cheap. But HP, which has faced big threats to its business for five years or so, now also has to contend with the disruption of its impending split into two companies. So, is HP a great value stock at this point -- or a value trap to be avoided?Approaching the splitOn Nov. 1, Hewlett-Packard plans to split into two companies. The company's enterprise hardware, services, and software businesses will be spun off as a new company called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. The rest of the company -- consisting of the PC and printer businesses -- will be renamed HP Inc.The two post-split companies would be roughly equal in size, with each having more than $50 billion in annual revenue based on their 2014 results. But HP's revenue has been under pressure for several years now, falling from $127.2 billion in 2011 to $111.5 billion in 2014. Revenue is on pace to decline another 6% this year, largely due to the strong dollar.Despite HP's falling revenue, it has been able to keep earnings relatively stable through an ever-widening cost-cutting program. It has also been buying back some stock to bolster EPS.Why the split could be good for investorsIn his classic investment book You Can Be a Stock Market Genius, Joel Greenblatt claims that corporate spinoffs offer great prospects for stellar stock returns. This would seem to bode well for Hewlett-Packard stock.There are a number of reasons why spinoffs (and their parent companies) tend to do well. Two of them seem particularly relevant to HP.First, the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP will each be more focused companies. That may allow for more effective management of each half. Most importantly, it will make it easier to ""pay for performance"" by tying executive pay to stock performance. As a large conglomerate, HP can't do that as well today, as the stock's value depends on the performance of many business segments that are quite different from one another.MOST OF THE CASH FLOW FROM HP'S LUCRATIVE PRINTING BUSINESS WILL BE RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERS. PHOTO: THE MOTLEY FOOLSecond, the split will create two businesses with very different investment characteristics. HP will be positioned as an income play. It will keep most of the combined company's debt and cash, and it probably will return most of the cash generated by its printing and PC businesses to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.By contrast, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will be almost debt-free, in an attempt to give it the flexibility to pursue big M&A deals. (As a separate company, it could even be a potential target although it will still be quite large.) Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will also spend a lot on R&D in order to improve its positioning in growth segments of the IT market.Does the split make Hewlett-Packard stock a buy?While spinoff stocks often perform well, the biggest gains usually come when the spinoff is significantly smaller than the parent company, according to Greenblatt. In this case, it's closer to a 50-50 split, which removes some of the factors that tend to help spinoff stocks.Furthermore, even if the spinoff unlocks value, one or both of the stocks could face significant selling pressure in the immediate aftermath of the split. That's because some investors who own Hewlett-Packard stock today may only be interested in one part of the company and will sell shares of the other half as soon as the split occurs.HP shares are cheap enough that it could still be worthwhile to build a small position before the November split. While revenue pressure is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, HP should be able to keep its profit and cash flow relatively stable through its cost-cutting initiatives.But the biggest opportunities may come later this year after the split is completed. Considering Hewlett-Packard stock is already quite cheap, if either half of the company faces significant selling pressure following the split, it could become a great bargain purchase."
3 PC Stocks to Watch,"Jun 3, 2015 at 4:00PM","The rise of mobile computing has taken a toll on the demand for traditional PCs, and weighed on the stock of firms that depend on PC sales. Yet, the PC isn't dead, at least not yet -- there were more than 300 million sold last year.Investors interested in the PC space have many stocks to choose from, but Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) remain three of the most vital.Hewlett-Packard will soon create a pure play PC OEMHewlett-Packard is the second-largest PC manufacturer in the world, and its PCs generate a significant amount of its revenue (about 30% last quarter) and earnings (about 10%). But Hewlett-Packard also has many other businesses, including enterprise software and consulting.Fortunately for PC-minded investors, Hewlett-Packard plans to split. Later this year, Hewlett-Packard will separate itself into two companies, one of which will be the largest PC firm traded on a major U.S. exchange. HP will include the company's PC division; HP Enterprise will focus on software and services. HP will also notably include the company's large printer division, but its success appears inextricably linked to the traditional PC. Investors can buy into Hewlett-Packard now, knowing that they'll receive shares of both in the split, or wait for it to occur before taking a position.The Windows business is changingMicrosoft is in the midst of a transformation. Windows remains important to the software giant, but Microsoft's future appears tied more to cloud services like Azure and Office 365, ones capable of running across a wide variety of different platforms and devices. Nevertheless, Microsoft remains perhaps the single most important player in the PC market. Despite the rising popularity of Apple's Macs, Windows still powers about nine in every ten PCs sold worldwide.In July, Microsoft will launch Windows 10, the next incarnation of its long-running PC operating system. Windows 10 includes a number of key features that make the PC platform more intriguing, including better support for different form factors and more tight integration with Microsoft's online services.Microsoft is also increasingly a PC OEM in its own right. It doesn't come close to Hewlett-Packard, but sales of its Surface tablets have been rising in recent quarters. Surface-related revenue jumped 44% on an annual basis last quarter.Microsoft is still the single company best able to dictate the flow of the PC market, and the one that could benefit from it the most. If Windows 10 reignites interest in the PC, Microsoft's business could surge.Intel remains dependent on the traditional PCMicrosoft's longtime ally, Intel, could also benefit from a resurgent PC market. Intel has tried to diversify, including the recent agreement to purchase PLD-maker Altera, but its business is still linked to the demand for traditional PCs. About 60% of Intel's revenue comes from its processors used in traditional desktop and laptop computers.Intel's newly created Client Computing Group includes both the sales of its processors used in traditional PCs and those used in mobile devices. However, Intel has generated minuscule mobile revenue in recent quarters -- it was only $1 million in the third quarter of 2014 -- suggesting that almost all of the $7.4 billion its Client Computing Group generated last quarter was from its PC processors.That was down 8% from the same quarter last year. Intel's management cited a 16% decline in desktop PC sales to explain the drop.If Intel's data center, Internet-of-Things, and soon PLD businesses grow, the relative importance of its PC processor business may decline in the years to come. But for now, Intel is still very much tied to the industry, and the relative success of the PC."
Why HP Inc. Fell 53% in November,"Dec 11, 2015 at 12:39PM","IMAGE SOURCE: HP, EDITED BY THE AUTHOR.What: Shares of HP (NYSE:HPQ) fell 53.5% in November, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. Any stock chart service will give you the same hair-raising plunge. But of course, there's a perfectly reasonably explanation for this. The old HP is now two separate businesses, and these simple charts and figures don't take the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) ticker into account.So what: Hewlett-Packard Enterprise sprung into existence at the very start of November, in the tax-free form of a share dividend paid out to current HP shareholders.The Silicon Valley beast was no longer a single entity with a $50 billion market cap, but two smaller operations with individual market caps in the $20 billion to $30 billion range.Through a few ups and downs along the way, both of the new HP stocks ended November roughly 5% higher than their monthly opening levels. That was enough to beat the S&P 500 market index, which traded roughly sideways during this period.And nobody lost 50% here. It's a mirage, but one etched into HPQ's stock charts forevermore.Now what: At one point, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise was lagging behind the markets and its corporate sibling while HP raced ahead to a 20% November gain. Fourth-quarter results quickly brought the consumer-oriented stock down to earth while boosting the enterprise operation, bringing everyone back to square 1.If nothing else, that report reminded shareholders how little things had really changed from the single-ticker days. As CEO of one company and chairman of the other, Meg Whitman still pulls all the strings here. More than $1 billion of the two companies' $26.4 billion in total sales came from inter-segment transactions, meaning that 4% of HP's business was funded by other HP units.The two companies should eventually start drifting apart -- if Whitman will allow it. That's the real test of how effective this business split really was. For now, it's very much business as usual, and that's not a compliment at all.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The 3 Best Stocks to Invest in Hardware,"Jun 18, 2015 at 8:45AM","Hardware is a large and diverse category, encompassing many different things, including PCs, tablets, smartphones, and smart gadgets of all kinds. There are quite a few different ways for investors to play hardware. Below are three stocks that offer exposure to the actual physical side of the tech universe.Apple has the most profitable hardware in the worldIs Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) a hardware company? Or a software company? Steve Jobs argued that Apple was a software company that just happened to make hardware. ""A Mac is OSX -- in a beautiful box -- but it's [just] OSX,"" Jobs said, in a joint interview with Bill Gates in 2007.Nevertheless, Apple doesn't actually sell its software -- at least not directly. When consumers purchase Macs and iPhones, they're buying hardware, even if they are primarily purchasing them for the software (OSX and iOS, respectively). Apple derives about 90% of its revenue, and virtually all of its profit, from hardware. iPhones compose the overwhelming bulk of its sales, with the Mac and iPad coming in a distant second and third, respectively.And while Jobs believed that Apple was fundamentally a software company, selling hardware remains the key to Apple's overarching business philosophy. Unlike competitors Microsoft and Google, which build platforms for third-party hardware companies, Apple believes its software can only excel when it's built in-house alongside its hardware. Apple may be letting third parties create bands for the recently released Apple Watch, but consumers can only buy the Apple Watch from Apple itself (in contrast to Android Wear, which is available from a wide variety of different vendors)   Its revenue mix may shift -- perhaps one day, in the distant future, Apple Watch will overtake the iPhone -- but Apple seems committed to hardware for the long haul.In the interim, there's many reasons to like Apple stock, including its excellent balance sheet and stellar demand for the iPhone 6. Apple's smartphone business has never been stronger -- its last two quarters were the best in the iPhone's history -- and Apple continues to return capital to shareholders. In April, it pledged to spend $200 billion on buybacks and dividends by the end of March, 2017. Unfortunately, Apple has offered up little in the way of hard numbers on the Apple Watch, but has said only about 20% of iPhone owners have upgraded to an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus. Baring a drastic change in the smartphone market, Apple could continue to sell millions of iPhones going forward, and continue to generate billions in the process.Hewlett-Packard will offer investors something close to a pure-play hardware company There's more to Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ) than just PCs. Later this year, the company plans to cleave itself in two, splitting into HP and HP Enterprises. The latter will be composed of Hewlett-Packard's software and services businesses; the former, Hewlett-Packard's hardware businesses.As it stands, Hewlett-Packard is one of the largest makers of traditional PCs in the world (number two according to research firm IDC). In its most recent quarter, it derived about one-third of its revenue from its Personal Systems (read: PCs) business. HP will also include Hewlett-Packard's printer business, which generates less revenue than its PC business but is higher margin. When combined, the two businesses brought in just slightly more than half of Hewlett-Packard's revenue and earnings last quarter.Hewlett-Packard has many competitors in the PC hardware business, but most of them are either listed on foreign exchanges (Lenovo) or are private (Dell). If you want to invest in a pure hardware company, you could purchase shares of Hewlett-Packard now, selling off the shares of HP Enterprises you receive after the split, or simply wait for the split to happen and then buy shares of HP.There's reason to believe that the new, hardware-focused HP could be a strong performer, and that current Hewlett-Packard shareholders will benefit from the split. Hewlett-Packard currently trades with a below market multiple (its trailing price-to-earnings ratio is, as I write this, around 12.5) and given the ongoing declines in the traditional PC industry, post-split HP is likely to trade even cheaper still. Despite increasingly powerful mobile devices, there's an enormous market for PCs -- more than 300 million of them were sold last year alone. Hewlett-Packard has yet to lay out the exact details of the firms' operating profiles -- on its last earnings call, it announced it would do so later this year -- but new HP is likely to be a company focused on returning capital to shareholders. If the PC market stabilizes, HP could be strong performer.Best Buy is an indirect way to get exposure Lastly, there's Best Buy (NYSE: BBY), one of the only pure-play electronics retailers left. Best Buy doesn't make any hardware itself, but it sells plenty of it. Last quarter, 78% of Best Buy's revenue came from the sale of consumer electronics and mobile gadgets, including smartphones, PCs, tablets, game consoles, and TVs, among many other products. Many of the companies that make these products are listed outside of the U.S. (LG, HTC) or are private (Jawbone, Belkin). They may be divisions of much larger companies (like Nest and Google), or relatively insignificant portions of their companies' bottom lines (like Microsoft's Surface Pro). In all of these cases, it's hard -- or even impossible -- for investors to gain exposure. Best Buy, then, offers an interesting secondary play on hardware.Obviously, Best Buy faces competition, and while there's a lot that it can control, it's success ultimately depends on hardware manufacturers' product cycles, and consumers' demand for that hardware. That demand has been relatively tepid in recent quarters -- according to research firm NPD, sales of consumer electronics fell 5.3% on an annual basis from the middle of February through beginning of May -- but could be poised for a rebound.If new product categories like wearable devices (smartwatches and fitness trackers), smart home gadgets, and set-top boxes stoke consumers' demand for hardware, Best Buy should see an upturn in its sales, and a corresponding increase in its profitability. Although Best Buy's sales have actually contracted in recent quarters (down about 1% on an annual basis last quarter), its profitability has increased as it has successfully reduced its costs. A leaner Best Buy could be a top way for investors to play a stronger hardware market.Bonus: Fitbit should go public in the near futureInvestors can't buy shares of Fitbit just yet, but they should be able to later this year. The maker of popular fitness trackers has filed for an IPO, and should begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange later this year. Almost all of Fitbit's revenue comes from the sale of hardware. To date, it's sold nearly 21 million fitness trackers, including the Fitbit Charge and the Fitbit Surge.There's some evidence that Fitbit may begin diversifying its revenue stream, branching out into different sorts of products but remaining true to its hardware roots. Rival Jawbone has sued Fitbit, alleging that the latter poached the former's audio engineer for his help in developing forthcoming products.Fitbit is profitable, and 21 million is a drop in the bucket compared to the potential market (there are more than 200 million adults living in the U.S. alone). If it convince more consumers to purchase and use its fitness trackers, it could become one of the more attractive investments in the hardware space.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks to Watch in 3D Printing,"Jun 26, 2015 at 10:15AM","Investing in 3D printing stocks is an exciting prospect for investors to consider. The technology offers the potential to revolutionize the way things are made, and the industry is projected to grow significantly in the coming years. This powerful combination fueled investor enthusiasm that the Third Industrial Revolution -- a term coined by The Economist in April 2012 -- was just around the corner.The following chart illustrates how the largest 3D printing stocks by revenue and market capitalization, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), have performed since The Economist article was published. Suffice it to say, it's been a wild ride.SSYS DATA BY YCHARTS.Looking back, it appears that investor optimism toward 3D printing stocks got pushed to extremes, and created an environment in which they couldn't live up to their ever-growing expectations. However, despite the volatility that has ensued during the last three years, the long-term prospects of the 3D printing industry remain intact, which is a good reason for investors to keep an eye on 3D printing stocks.According to Wohlers Report 2015, a leading 3D printing industry insights publication, the 3D printing industry generated $4.1 billion in worldwide revenue in 2014, and is expected to grow by more than 31% per year until 2020, eventually surpassing $21 billion in annual revenue.Read on to find out why investors should consider 3D Systems, Stratasys, and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) as top 3D printing stocks to watch.The industry leaderSince the inception of its MakerBot, Objet, and Stratasys brands, Stratasys has sold a grand total of 129,197 3D printers through the first quarter, the vast majority of which are still in operation today. This market-leading installed base feeds the company's razor-and-blade business, in which the 3D printers it sells are the razors, and the materials they consume over their lifetimes are the blades.At the end of the day, Stratasys' large installed base sets the company up to generate long-term streams of recurring revenue from the repeated sale of consumables, which tend to carry higher gross profit margins than 3D printing hardware. In the first quarter, the company's consumable revenue grew by 18% year over year, or 25% on a constant-currency basis. Management attributed this growth to more use of its 3D printers, and from expanding its installed base of 3D printers.Looking ahead, if Stratasys can maintain its market-leading installed base, it should help the company remain relevant in the industry for years to come.A close secondWhat 3D Systems lacks in installed base, it makes up for in being the most diversified 3D printing company in the industry. In total, 3D Systems has seven distinct technologies in its portfolio, which theoretically should allow it to cater to a wider variety of applications than its competitors do.Unfortunately, in practice, 3D Systems' jack-of-all trades approach has been plagued with a myriad of execution issues that suggest that management's focus on operational efficiency has taken a backseat to building a highly diversified 3D printing company. After all, the company has made more than 50 acquisitions in the last four years, which has inadvertently created many points of friction between itself and the various businesses being acquired.However, despite these challenges, 3D Systems remains a 3D printing stock to watch because it's a close second to Stratasys in terms of the annual revenue it generates, and has $199 million in cash on its balance sheet that could be used to improve its operations and enhance its competitive positioning.The sleeping giantWith plans to enter the 3D printing space in late 2016 with a homegrown, inkjet-based 3D printing technology that it's calling Multi Jet Fusion, HP is a must-watch 3D printing stock.Multi Jet Fusion leverages decades of inkjet experience, which HP claims is 10 times faster than today's leading extrusion-based and selective laser sintering technologies. From a customer point of view, an order-of-magnitude increase in speed could prove to be a compelling value proposition in industries where reducing lead times lowers the cost of developing parts and products.SOURCE: HEWLETT-PACKARD.Beyond Multi Jet Fusion's disruptive potential, HP has a tremendous amount of cash, sales experience, and brand recognition that could be used to dilute the efforts of other 3D printing stocks. To put HP's nearly $14.8 billion cash hoard in perspective, it could be used to acquire -- if it desired -- both 3D Systems and Stratasys at 100% premiums above their current stock prices, and still have more than $6 billion in cash left over.Although the actual risk that HP poses to 3D printing stocks is impossible to calculate, it's clear that HP wields a lot of power to shake up the industry.Building a watch listWhen building a watch list for 3D printing stocks, it's important to include companies that will likely shape the industry in the years to come. With Stratasys' market-leading installed base, 3D Systems' highly diversified business model, and HP's anticipated entrance, prospective investors have a solid foundation of 3D printing stocks to add to their watch lists.For more on this topic:3D Printing Companies: What Investors Need to KnowThe Best Stocks to Buy in 3D Printing10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

TIAA-CREF: What This $8.6 Billion Trust Has Been Selling,"Jun 2, 2015 at 9:04PM","SOURCE: TIAA-CREFEvery quarter, many money managers have to disclose what they've bought and sold via ""13F"" filings. Their latest moves can shine a bright light on smart stock picks.Today let's look at the TIAA-CREF Trust Co. This trust is run by TIAA-CREF, which offers financial services to those in the fields of education, medicine, culture, and research. Almost 100 years old, it has a solid reputation: 71% of its funds earn four or five stars in Morningstar ratings. The TIAA-CREF Trust Co. manages much of TIAA-CREF's client money, and its reportable stock portfolio totaled $8.6 billion  in value as of March 31.Interesting developmentsSo what does TIAA-CREF Trust's latest quarterly 13F filing tell us? Here are a few interesting details: It pared back its position in Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) by 53% and sold out entirely of Kellogg Company (NYSE:K), Alcoa (NYSE:AA), and Transocean LTD (NYSE:RIG).Hewlett-Packard Company's revenue has been shrinking for the past few years now, and in its latest quarter, even its printing division, which contributes the most to revenue, posted a 5% year-over-year loss. Like other computer companies, HP is struggling in an increasingly mobile world.How is HP responding? For one, its printing and PC business will split from the technical-services business by the end of the year. Bulls favor this move, as the service business enjoys wider profit margins than the hardware business. Right now, though, HP is sputtering and losing ground to cloud-based services (while choosing  not to be a public cloud company), and it has laid off tens of thousands of its workers. Whether the leaner organization can become consistently profitable remains to be seen.Whitman is also aiming to unlock value by selling off a majority stake in its China operations for $2.3 billion, anticipating that leaving more control in the hands of local companies will spur more growth. Other growth initiatives include 3D printing, though some are not encouraged by the company's anemic R&D spending. And HP is still the market leader in global servers with a 28% share, and industry standard servers posted 17% year-over-year sales growth in the quarter. With ample cash and profits, HP has the potential to turn its business around. Yet many are choosing to wait and see, and TIAA-CREF seems to be among them. KELLOGG IS INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS AS IT TRIES TO BOOST SALES. SOURCE: FLICKR USER MIKE MOZART.Kellogg Company also sports some worrisome numbers, with recent years featuring shrinking revenue, free cash flow, gross margins, and net margins. The company has been fighting weak sales while also facing currency-translation headwinds. In its last quarter, earnings sank 44% over year-earlier levels, and revenue dropped 5%. That was actually better than some analysts had expected, though. Revenue growth has been in the double digits in Latin America and Asia, while merely in the low single digits in Europe.Kellogg is trying to adapt to changing consumer preferences. In 2014, 19 of 25 Kellogg cereals posted shrinking sales. Oatmeal, eggs, and frozen waffles, meanwhile, have been gaining ground. So Kellogg is responding with innovation. Management notes, ""We have renovated our Special K bars to include more visible ingredients, and we are launching Special K Chewy Nut bars which include simple ingredients preferred by consumers."" Kellogg has a four-year cost-cutting and efficiency-increasing program under way, and it's also working to build its brand and improve in-store execution -- but cost-cutting doesn't boost your top line. It's great that Kellogg has a strategy, but TIAA-CREF and many other investors may worry that cereal will continue losing ground, which would be seriously detrimental to Kellogg. Aluminum giant Alcoa has been struggling with weak demand and overcapacity in recent years and was ejected from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2013. It's responding to its challenges by diversifying away from the commodity business, adding value-added offerings such as customized high-end materials. Its acquisition of titanium specialist RTI International Metals can help it serve the aerospace industry better as it moves toward using more titanium instead of aluminum. And automakers are using more aluminum in order to increase fuel efficiency, so Alcoa is now selling high-strength, military-grade aluminum to Ford Motor Company.Transocean LTD, along with its peers, has been suffering in the face of falling oil prices, diminished interest in oil drilling, decreases in day rates for its rigs, and canceled long-term contracts, among other things. However, bulls see these challenges as temporary and anticipate a strong market position for Transocean in the future, in part because of a growing world population with an ever-growing need for oil. A bit of recent good news for the company and investors is that Transocean has settled with victims of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill for $211 million and that Transocean, BP, and Halliburton have agreed to drop outstanding claims against each other. That's not a huge sum for a company raking in about $9 billion annually, and it puts a lot of uncertainty behind the company, helping investors view its future more clearly. Still, its current challenges may persist until the price of oil starts rising significantly, day rates rise, and drilling activity picks up.We should never blindly copy any investor's moves, no matter how talented the investor. But it can be useful to keep an eye on what smart folks are doing, and 13F forms can be great places to find intriguing candidates for our portfolios.The $16,122 Social Security bonus you could be missingIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

4 Investments That Paid Off Big for Celebrities,"Nov 1, 2015 at 11:11AM","Oprah Winfrey's investment in Weight Watchers (NYSE:WTW) reportedly netted her a one-day paper gain of $70 million after the weight-loss center's stock soared on the news she took a 10% stake in the company and a seat on its board of directors. But the half-billion-dollar gain in Weight Watchers' market cap due to the ""Oprah effect"" remains a risky bet that the heavily indebted, customer-losing company can turn itself around.PHOTO: APHRODITE-IN-NYC.Taking fliers on risky investments seems to be a hallmark of celebrity investors. Actors Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger invested in the Planet Hollywood chain that, at one time, had almost 100 restaurants open; but after several bankruptcies, it's left with just six.Ice skater Dorothy Hamill invested in the Ice Capades, which, like Oprah's Weight Watchers deal, also seemed like a natural fit, but it went bankrupt and subsequently sent her seeking the protection of the courts, too.Even when stars do have big successes, like U2 frontman Bono, whose venture capital firm Elevation Partners were early investors in both Yelp and Facebook, they can still suffer big losses. Elevation had previously invested in magazine publisher Forbes Media and mobile device pioneer Palm, but both investments ended up needing to be rescued -- by an Asian investment firm in the case of Forbes, and by Hewlett-Packard's buyout of Palm.Still, celebrities do seem to have their fill of successes beyond the likes of Ashton Kutchner, who is almost synonymous with small-tech start-ups, and who invested in Skype just two years before it was bought out by Microsoft. Below are four additional entertainment industry A-listers who have seen their investments pay off big.50 Cent and Vitaminwater Having survived being shot nine times, Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson went on to become one of the hottest hip-hop artists with his album Get Rich or Die Tryin. His manager hooked Jackson up with a Reebok commercial, and knowing the advertising executive for Glaceau would see it, he had the rapper take a big swig of the water company's Vitaminwater at the end.CURTIS ""50 CENT"" JACKSON TURNED WATER INTO GOLD WITH HIS INVESTMENT IN VITAMINWATER. PHOTO: DISNEY|ABC TELEVISION GROUP.The manager's hunch was right, and the executive quickly inked a deal with Jackson that saw the hip-hop star get a reputed 10% stake in the company. A few years later, Coca-Cola bought Glaceau for $4.1 billion, and 50 Cent was suddenly worth a lot more than that, netting an estimated $60 million to $100 million from the deal.Dr. Dre and BeatsAlso coming from the rap scene, Dr. Dre had become something of a hip-hop impresario since his days with the hardcore rap group N.W.A, which was just recently profiled in the movie Straight Outta Compton. By 2008, he was an industry powerbroker, and together with Monster Products and legendary record producer Jimmy Iovine, Dre created Beats high-performance headphones. It subsequently expanded into streaming music, which caught the eye of Apple, and $3.2 billion later, Dr. Dre further cemented his position as the richest man in rap.DR. DRE IS A LONG WAY FROM THE STREETS OF COMPTON AFTER THE DEAL WITH APPLE FOR BEATS WAS COMPLETED. PHOTO: FOEOC KANNILC.Madonna and Vita CocoThe Like a Virgin singer Madonna was said to like the taste of virgin coconut water so much that, in 2010, she invested $1.5 million in the leading producer of the rehydrating beverage Vita Coco, which had a 60% share of the market. Since then, rival Coca-Cola took a minority stake in Zico reportedly for ""way less"" than what it paid for Vitaminwater, and PepsiCo introduced its own O.N.E. brand.PEOPLE MAY HAVE THOUGHTS MADONNA WAS NUTS FOR INVESTING IN COCONUT WATER MAKER VITA COCO, BUT SHE WAS LITERALLY PUTTING HER MONEY WHERE HER MOUTH WAS. PHOTO: DAVID SHANKBONE.Vita Coco was largely controlled by its two co-founders and a Belgian investment firm tied to Anheuser-Busch InBev, who held equal shares totalling about 80% of the company. Last year, however, Vita Coco sold a 25% stake in the business to Reignwood Group, the parent company of Red Bull China, at an enterprise valuation of U.S. $665 million.William Shatner and Priceline.com.These days, William Shatner may be just as famous for his portrayal of priceline.com's (NASDAQ:BKNG) The Negotiator as being Captain Kirk from Star Trek -- so much so that the online travel agency was forced to bring him back after killing him off in one commercial. Yet when he first signed on for the role, he asked to be paid in stock options in the company rather than cash, and at one point, was said to have made as much as $600 million as a result, at least on paper.

Will HP Inc Finally Kill Microsoft Corporation's Surface Pro 4?,"Nov 29, 2015 at 11:22AM","Over the past few years, Hewlett-Packard has started to consider Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) a dangerous rival instead of a helpful partner. That's because Microsoft started selling Surface 2-in-1 devices to compete against HP's core laptop and tablet businesses. After a rough start, the Surface gained momentum and sparked a form factor revolution across the PC market over the past three years.HP challenged the Surface repeatedly with hybrid devices like the Envy x2, Spectre x2, Pro x2, and Elite x2, but most of those devices sank in the saturated market of Windows 2-in-1 devices. In HP's final quarter as a single company, PC sales fell 13% annually, with double-digit declines in desktops and workstations. Sales of notebooks, which include those hybrid devices, fell 8%.HP'S ELITE X2 1012. SOURCE: HP.But HP isn't giving up. After splitting from its enterprise business, the new HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) unveiled the Elite x2 1012 to challenge the Surface Pro 4. But will HP's latest ""Surface killer"" fare any better than its predecessors?By the numbers: HP Elite x2 vs Surface Pro 4The base models of the Elite x2 1012 and Surface Pro 4 both cost $899. However, the Elite's base model includes a travel keyboard and an Active Pen stylus. The Surface Pro 4 comes with the Surface Pen, but the keyboard must be purchased separately. As for the other specs, the Surface Pro 4 has a higher resolution display and supports beefier i5 and i7 processors.

The Elite x2 is crafted from a single piece of aluminum, while the Surface Pro 4 and other 2-in-1 manufacturers are made from molds or stamped metal. The Elite x2 has easily removable parts which can be repaired on-site, while the Surface Pro 4 has to be sent off-site to be serviced.Unlike the Surface Pro 4, the Elite x2 has an optional smartcard reader keyboard for vertical market industries like the federal government and energy companies. The Elite x2 offers an LTE wireless connectivity option, which the Surface Pro 4 lacks, for $100 more. The Elite x2's Core M processors also feature vPro technology, which the Surface Pro 4's processors notably lack. vPro tech enables a wider range of security features across the BIOS and biometric scanners, and is considered more manageable in IT environments.MICROSOFT'S SURFACE PRO 4. SOURCE: MICROSOFT.How this fits into HP's businessHP is clearly aiming the Elite x2 at enterprise customers, which tend to upgrade their PCs in large bulk orders. Since replacing all aging PCs with iOS or Android tablets can be impractical due to compatibility issues with legacy software, companies are often more inclined to buy Windows 2-in-1 devices to ""bridge the gap"" between PCs and tablets.Research firm IDC expects global shipments of tablets to fall 8% annually this year as 2-in-1 shipments surge 86.5%. IDC notes that 2-in-1 devices have struggled in the past due to high prices, unappealing designs, and a distaste for Windows 8. But as more competitors enter the market, prices have declined, and designs have improved. Windows 10 also arguably offers a better 2-in-1 experience than its predecessors.HP's Elite x2 1012 is a formidable device, but Microsoft can still leverage its brand, enterprise software presence, and existing partnerships to sell the Surface Pro 4 to big businesses. It's unclear how much of the Windows 2-in-1 market Microsoft controls, but research firm Strategy Analytics recently stated that the Surface Pro 3 and Surface 3 will boost Windows' overall share of the tablet market to 10% by the end of the year.A growing but crowded marketIDC estimates that over 40 different vendors shipped 2-in-1 products in the second quarter of 2015, up from just 14 vendors two years ago. That competition caused Microsoft's Surface revenue to fall 26% annually in its most recent quarter. But that decline can be considered a mixed blessing for Microsoft, since it means that other OEMs are now shouldering the risks in expanding its Windows 10 ecosystem.Looking ahead, HP should probably worry more about larger hardware makers like Lenovo and Dell instead of focusing on the Surface Pro. As its rivals flood the market with new 2-in-1 devices, HP's new Elite x2 could struggle to make a lasting impression on enterprise customers.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Warren Buffett Is Wrong About IBM,"Nov 5, 2015 at 2:14PM","""I don't think there's any company that's done a better job of laying out where they're going to go and then having gone there. They have laid out a road map and I should have paid more attention to it five years ago, where they were going to go in five years ending in 2010. Now they've laid out another road map for 2015.""-- Warren Buffett on IBM (NYSE:IBM) in 2011 No one has been a bigger cheerleader for IBM over past five years than Warren Buffett, but the venerable tech giant seems to have lost that trusty road map.IBM shares got crushed again two weeks ago, falling more than 5% after the company reported its 14th straight quarter of declining sales, with revenue falling 14% and adjusted EPS down 9%.The explanation for IBM's woes is a familiar one. Big Blue's transition from a hardware/software company to a cloud-based services provider is taking longer than expected, and sales and profits continue to fall as IBM sheds its older units. Management has maintained its claim that its strategy is the right one, but the market continues to disagree.The stock is now trading at a five-year low, and has fallen more than a third from its 2013 peak. Buffett once asked for a stock swoon, saying in 2012, ""We should wish for IBM's stock price to languish throughout the five years."" Needless to say, he's gotten his wish.The stock has languished, allowing IBM to buy back even more stock than it otherwise could have, a strategy it hasn't hesitated to implement.But after three-and-a-half years of sliding sales and broken promises about reaching $20 in EPS, it's clear that IBM's management has failed to achieve the goals it set for itself, and Buffett's bet has thus far been a poor one. Looking back at his quotes defending his purchase of IBM, we can now see that his logic was flawed. Here are a few reasons why:Lauding past CEOsWhen he first dumped over $10 billion into Big Blue, Buffett argued that IBM had an excellent record of setting goals for itself and knocking them down, and praised former CEOs Lou Gerstner and Sam Palmisamo for rescuing the company from near-bankruptcy and driving growth ever since.But current CEO Ginni Rommety was named to the leadership chair in 2011, and brought a new strategy. In the tech world, the direction of a single leader can mean the difference between blockbuster success and utter failure, and the accomplishments of Gerstner and Palmisamo mean little as the company transitions into the cloud era. There is no benefit derived from portraits hanging in the board room.Incorrectly assessing IBM's economic moatPerhaps the most important quality of a Buffett stock is that it has an economic moat, or a sustainable competitive advantage. The Oracle of Omaha loves stocks like The Coca-Cola Co, for example, which has an unrivaled brand name and distribution pipeline that provide it with a global reach and fat operating margins.""I would imagine if you're in some country around the world and you're developing your IT department, you're probably going to feel more comfortable with IBM than with many companies,"" Buffett once said.  The statement indicates he believes IBM's competitive advantage is in its relationships with IT departments, along with its reputation and history as a provider of IT services and products. But as IBM transitions into a different kind of company than it's been previously, that advantage loses value.The fast-changing computing landscape explains why other legacy tech giants like Oracle, Hewlett-Packard, and Microsoft have struggled in recent years, compared to younger web-based companies. If Buffett's thesis were true, we'd expect IBM to be leading the cloud revolution. Instead, that title belongs to Amazon.com, which saw the opportunity early and invested heavily in it. According to tech research firm Gartner, Amazon has more than 10 times the computing capacity of the next 14 largest cloud providers.  Investing outside of your wheelhouseBuffett long eschewed investments in tech companies, claiming he didn't understand the industry and couldn't project future cash flows. But he made an exception for IBM for the reasons above, claiming he had studied the company closely over his career, having read its annual reports for 50 years. However, in technology especially, oldest is by no means equivalent to best, and the biggest tech stocks today are much younger than IBM. As the chart below shows, IBM has significantly lagged the biggest names in tech since Buffett first bought shares in 2011.IBM DATA BY YCHARTSFacebook, not included in that chart, is up more than 150% since its 2012 IPO. A bet on any four of those stocks would have delivered more than $10 billion in gains back to Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B). Instead, his conglomerate is in the red on its IBM betBuffett's wish for the share price to languish has been granted, but cheap buybacks without growing earnings are meaningless. After all, the best companies on the market don't thrive because of share repurchases. They invest in research and new opportunities, and develop new businesses that drive profitable growth. IBM, with its sluggish transition into cloud computing and excessive on returning capital to shareholders, seems to have forgotten how to do that. "
10 Most Profitable Businesses in San Francisco,"Jun 9, 2015 at 8:00AM","The San Francisco Bay area is home to many of the world's great companies. A hotbed of technology and biotech start-ups, the Bay area has no shortage of unprofitable companies burning through cash, but it also has many of the world's most profitable corporations.Below are the 10 most profitable companies headquartered within the region, ranked by their last reported annual net income.Company Ticker Net Income (latest annual, in millions USD) Net Profit Margin (latest annual)Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 39,510  21.6%Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) 23,057  27.40%Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) 14,444  21.88%Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) 12,101  48.60%Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) 10,955  28.62%Yahoo! (NASDAQ:YHOO) 7,521.7  162.9%Visa (NYSE:V) 5,438  42.83%Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) 5,013  4.80%Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) 2,940  23.58%McKesson (NYSE:MCK) 1,476  0.82%SOURCE: S&P CAPITAL IQ.No surprises hereSix of the 10 companies -- Apple, Google, Oracle, Yahoo!, Hewlett-Packard, and Facebook -- are technology companies, which shouldn't be a surprise to anyone familiar with the San Francisco region. Apple's fiscal year 2014 was stellar, and fiscal 2015 is shaping up to be even more impressive. It wasn't included in the above figures since the year is not yet complete, but Apple's fiscal year 2015 first quarter was the most profitable in corporate history, and the second quarter was nearly as strong. Demand for the iPhone has fueled Apple's strong profitability and, to some extent, has even benefited several of the other companies on this list. Google, for example, controls the competing Android ecosystem, but it derives about 75% of its mobile search revenue from iPhone users. Facebook generates the bulk -- almost three-quarters -- of its revenue from mobile users, many of them iPhone users.Percentage wise, all six tech companies on this list have similar net profit margins, with the exception of Yahoo! and Hewlett-Packard. A large percentage of Hewlett-Packard's revenue -- more than half -- comes from its PC and printing businesses, which are mature and notably low margin. Later this year, Hewlett-Packard will split itself in two -- one company (HP) will contain these business segments, the other (HP Enterprise) will focus on enterprise software and services. The latter will have a significantly higher profit margin, but it may not make the list in terms of total net income.Yahoo!'s shockingly high net profit margin was a byproduct of the sale of its stake in Alibaba. Without that sale, Yahoo!'s net income and profit margin would've been sharply reduced (its 2013 net income, for example, was only $1.366 billion).Banking and biotechOf the other four, two are involved in pharmaceuticals (Gilead Sciences and McKesson), and two are financial companies (Visa and Wells Fargo).Wells Fargo has long been a banking behemoth, and a favorite of billionaire and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett. In fact, Wells Fargo is Berkshire's largest holding. In contrast to other San Francisco companies, which are often on the cutting edge of technology, Wells Fargo operates like a traditional savings and loans company, mostly lending money out to consumers for homes and cars. Buffett also has a stake in Visa, though it's relatively small compared to his Wells Fargo investment.Gilead Sciences' strong profitability and profit margin come from its deep portfolio of HIV and hepatitis C drugs. McKesson's margins are minuscule, but its business is so enormous (it generated nearly $180 million in revenue in 2015), it still makes this list.Foolish wrapOne thing from this list is clear: San Francisco is its own epicenter of today's most successful businesses, tech and otherwise.However, looking at a company's total net income, or even net profit margin, does not tell investors much. Owning shares of an immensely profitable company is ideal, but that profitability may not continue. Rather than stand as a buy or sell recommendation, this list could merely serve as a jumping-off point. Foolish investors know there's more research to be done before making investment decisions.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Wal-Mart's Turnaround Will Take a Long Time,"Aug 23, 2015 at 12:45PM","A few years ago, Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman opined that executing a turnaround for an enormous business typically takes a full five years. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) shareholders have recently learned just how true that statement was.WAL-MART'S EARNINGS MISSED EXPECTATIONS AGAIN LAST QUARTER. PHOTO: THE MOTLEY FOOLThis week, the retail titan reported Q2 earnings that missed analysts' estimates. The company also cut its full-year earnings guidance and significantly slashed its e-commerce growth target for this year. In the past two years or so, Wal-Mart has made some savvy moves to fix its business. However, it will probably take several more years for it to return to sustainable growth.Another earnings disappointmentOn Tuesday, Wal-Mart announced that Q2 earnings per share came in at $1.08, down by $0.13 year over year. Analysts had been expecting EPS of $1.12. Revenue rose a meager 0.1% year over year to $120.2 billion, although it would have risen 3.6% excluding the negative impact of the strengthening dollar.Wal-Mart admitted that it's facing significant macro headwinds in several major international markets. Meanwhile, it's facing unexpected cost pressures in the U.S. from increased ""shrink"" (items being lost or stolen), lower pharmacy margins, and a strategic decision to increase staffing levels to improve customer service.All of these cost pressures came on top of the company's decision to raise starting pay to at least $9 for Wal-Mart associates as of April and its heavy investments in e-commerce. As a result, Wal-Mart now expects adjusted EPS to decline significantly, from $5.07 last year to a range of $4.40-$4.70 in the current 2016 fiscal year.That said, there were some bright spots in the quarterly report. Comparable-store sales in the Walmart U.S. division strengthened once again, rising 1.5% year over year. Comp sales rose a stellar 7.3% at the smaller Neighborhood Market stores, which are about 42,000 square feet on average. Wal-Mart just wasn't able to turn this sales growth into profit growth.Headwinds remainWal-Mart is working to address many of the challenges that hurt its earnings in the first half of 2015. It's putting more emphasis on loss prevention in its training. It also opened two new fulfillment centers last quarter and will open another two this quarter, which by Q4 will start to offset the costs of its e-commerce investments by reducing shipping costs.That said, the management team acknowledged during the company's earnings call that many of the current challenges will continue in the short run. If anything, economic conditions outside the U.S. have been getting worse in recent months -- not better. Pharmacy margins will remain under pressure. And Wal-Mart has a long way to go to catch up in e-commerce.PHARMACY MARGINS MAY REMAIN UNDER PRESSURE GOING FORWARD. PHOTO: THE MOTLEY FOOL.Additionally, wage pressure will continue next year, as the Walmart U.S. division will ensure that all current employees are paid at least $10 an hour starting in February. The company is also in the midst of adding 8,000 higher-paying department manager positions to improve customer service, creating another source of cost pressure.This turnaround will take timeDriving robust sales growth is challenging for a company as massive as Wal-Mart. However, it is absolutely critical for offsetting inescapable cost inflation.Raising employee pay and increasing staffing were both necessary investments to enable this much-needed sales growth. Wal-Mart's Q2 results show that these initiatives are already starting to work. However, it may take a few years for the full benefits -- such as lower employee turnover, higher productivity, and more attentive customer service -- to really show up.In the meantime, Wal-Mart has to swallow significant cost increases that will continue through the end of next year. It will probably take a few years beyond that for the Walmart U.S. operating margin to return to historical levels.The same could be said for some of Wal-Mart's other ongoing initiatives. The company is aiming to energize sales growth at Sam's Club by attracting higher-income consumers with an improved merchandise assortment. This strategy has great long-term potential, but it could take years for Sam's Club to make real headway, given Costco's dominance in this market segment.Similarly, the strong comp growth at Walmart Neighborhood Market locations in recent quarters shows that the company was right to focus its domestic growth on this format. Consumers clearly favor the smaller stores for most grocery trips. (Grocery sales didn't fare well in Walmart Supercenters last quarter.)WAL-MART'S NEIGHBORHOOD MARKET STORES HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL LATELY. PHOTO: WAL-MART.Yet for the second straight year, Wal-Mart is cutting back on its plans to expand this format. For FY15, the company planned to open 270 to 300 small-format stores at the beginning of the year, but it ultimately opened only 235. For FY16, Wal-Mart initially announced plans to open 220 more Neighborhood Markets. Now it plans to open 160 to 170 as part of a focus on ""quality over quantity.""Thus, while Wal-Mart has a lot of promising initiatives, they aren't even close to offsetting the impact of its wage increase and other investments this year. Even next year, investors shouldn't expect much earnings growth, as higher payroll costs could wipe out the impact of sales gains.As a result, Wal-Mart investors should settle in for a long slog. If everything goes according to plan, Wal-Mart could return to sustainable sales and profit growth a few years from now, leading to significant stock-price gains. In the meantime, there could be a few more apologies about the slow pace of the turnaround.10 stocks we like better than Walmart Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Cisco Systems, Inc.'s Best Segment in 2015","Dec 15, 2015 at 5:14PM","Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is best known for being the leading provider of network switches and routers, and the company dominates those two markets. Together, nearly 60% of Cisco's product revenue came from switching and routing during fiscal 2015, which ended in July, and both segments posted growth compared to fiscal 2014, with revenues rising by 5.3% and 1.2%, respectively.Neither of these segments are growing nearly as fast as Cisco's best-performing segment during 2015. The data center segment grew by 22% compared to 2014, recording $3.2 billion of revenue, about 8.5% of Cisco's total product revenue, up from 5.5% in fiscal 2013. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the data center segment continued to perform well, growing revenue by 24% year over year.Here's what investors need to know about this fast growing part of Cisco's business.CISCO UCS BLADE SERVERS. IMAGE SOURCE: CISCO.An overview of the data center segmentThe performance of Cisco's data center segment is no aberration; data centers has been Cisco's fastest growing major product category for each of the past five years, including fiscal 2015. The data center segment's main product is the Cisco Unified Computing System, or UCS, a line of servers that combine computing, networking, storage, and virtualization.Cisco's newest UCS servers are an example of composable infrastructure, where different types of infrastructure are pooled, and software allows each application to access exactly the resources it needs. This is often described as treating ""infrastructure-as-code,"" allowing for the automatic provisioning of resources for each application, similar to how public clouds like Amazon's AWS work. Cisco is a first-mover in this area, but Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) has also jumped on the composable infrastructure bandwagon with its Project Synergy.Cisco's UCS servers have been a major success for the company. During the third quarter of 2015, Cisco was the fifth largest server vendor in the world, capturing 6.6% of the market. In the x86 blade server market, Cisco had become the top vendor in the U.S. by late 2014, and the second largest vendor in the world, behind HP. For a business that started from nothing in 2009, Cisco's progress in the server market is impressive.In addition to servers, Cisco's data center segment includes the company's private and hybrid cloud efforts, namely the Cisco ONE Enterprise Cloud Suite and the Cisco Intercloud Fabric, as well as switches designed specifically for VMware vSphere.Can strong growth continue in 2016?With Cisco's share of the global server market still in the single-digits, there may still be plenty of room for the company to further expand its UCS server business. Composable infrastructure is a new technology, and it's difficult to predict what impact it will have in the coming years. But Cisco is an innovator in this area, and the leading server vendors should certainly be worried about Cisco's increasing market share. Much of Cisco's market share gains in the blade server market has been at the expense of HP, which has seen its blade server market share slump over the past five years.At the moment, Cisco's UCS business is growing far faster than the server market as a whole, and there's been no sign so far that Cisco's growth is slowing down. It's not hard to imagine Cisco rising to the No. 3 position in the server market in the long run, behind both HP and Dell, a move that would require the company to capture about 10% of the market. It's also possible that Cisco's market share tops out at some point, limited by the scope of its product offerings.Regardless, Cisco's data center business has been an unmitigated success over the past few years, growing far faster than the company's larger, more mature segments. Data centers is still a small part of Cisco's total revenue, but along with other fast-growing segments like security and collaboration, Cisco is becoming less dependent on its core switching and routing businesses. Those businesses will remain the bedrock of the company, but the data center segment has the potential to drive growth for years to come.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

10 Outrageous Ways the Government Spends Your Tax Dollars,"Jun 7, 2015 at 6:07AM","SOURCE: FLICKR USER MARIA HELENA CAREY. Editor's note: An earlier version of this article linked a $15,000 grant received by the Colorado Symphony from the National Endowment for the Arts to the symphony's 2014 ""Classically Cannabis"" series, which encouraged attendees to smoke marijuana before and/or during the show. This link was in error, as the funds were earmarked instead to finance a series of four symphonic concerts, as well as in-school performances, for elementary and middle school students. We regret and apologize for the error.For years, I've opined that understanding your cash flow and maintaining a working and adjustable budget are some of the most vital keys to a comfortable retirement. Unfortunately, the biggest ""business"" in the world, the U.S. government, hasn't heeded that advice and continues to spend far more than it brings in from taxes every year.After relatively small budget deficits ranging from $161 billion to $318 billion prior to the Great Recession, the need to reinvigorate the economy sent deficits soaring past the $1 trillion mark between 2009 and 2012. This year, the budget deficit is estimated to be a little below $600 billion.Regardless of your political affiliation, some of this spending will make sense. Social programs designed to help the impoverished, retired, or assist the unemployed get work can yield great returns. But, to be honest, not all government spending winds up looking smart in retrospect -- and Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) ensures that the American public knows about it.For the past three years, I've been reporting on Wastebook, Sen. Coburn's annual project that outlines 100 of the dumbest and most outrageous ways the government spent taxpayer dollars in the previous year.In October, Wastebook 2014 (link opens PDF) was released -- and is, according to Coburn, his final edition of the book given that health issues may soon force him to step down. What wasn't lacking was the typical candor we've come to expect when Coburn discusses the various ways lawmakers wasted your tax dollars.Overall, Wastebook 2014 details about $25 billion in wasteful spending. Although that's a veritable drop in the bucket based on our nation's annual spending in the trillions of dollars, it nonetheless represents the need to tighten our belt as a nation and really get a grasp on our cash flow to get our deficit under control.Though arbitrary (because these are all outrageous in their own ways), here are the 10 most outrageous ways the government spent your tax dollars in 2014.SOURCE: FLICKR USER TANGI BERTIN.1. Now there's something to ""Marvel"" at!According to Wastebook 2014, the Department of Defense is hard at work developing a Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit, or TALOS, which would be bulletproof. In reality, they're trying their hand at building a suit reminiscent of Iron Man. Unfortunately, TALOS is really in its early stages of development and will likely weigh 400 pounds when it's complete -- hardly Iron Man-like. Further, this $80 million, four-year budget could need as much as $1 billion, according to some industry analysts, just to make a workable prototype. Could you imagine the cost if these were produced on a larger scale? Ouch!SOURCE: NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE VIA FACEBOOK.2. A marijuana musical?In an effort to raise excitement surrounding the Colorado Symphony, the National Endowment for the Arts provided the Symphony with $15,000 to be used for it's ArtWorks Program, which includes ""innovative projects"" that offer insight through ""unconventional solutions."" One of the more unconventional solutions presented in 2014 by the Colorado Symphony was ""Classically Cannabis: The High Note Series,"" a classical ensemble complete with none other than marijuana. Designed to attract a younger audience, symphony-goers were encouraged to smoke marijuana either before or during the show (in designated patio areas).In its defense, the Colorado Symphony has refuted the insinuation made by Coburn and WasteBook regarding a link between the funds and the ""Classically Cannabis"" series. The Symphony doesn't deny receiving $15,000 from the NEA, but it says that the money was earmarked for other, more widely acceptable programs. According to Jerome Kern of the Colorado Symphony:In 2014, the Colorado Symphony applied for and received a $15,000 grant from the federally funded National Endowment for the Arts. The grant dollars were specifically earmarked to support a series of four symphonic concerts, as well as in-school performances for elementary and middle school students, in Salida, CO. The grant covered approximately half of the Colorado Symphony's expenses for this concert series; the balance is paid through ticket revenue, sponsorship and contributions from individual donors.3. NASA: Looking for life on other planets... and their phonesWe entrust NASA to boldly go where no one has gone before (or was that Jean-Luc Picard?), but these same geniuses who can precisely calculate shuttle trajectories hundreds of millions of miles from Earth can't seem to keep track of their smartphones or tablets.According to Wastebook, 14% of NASA's devices, or more than 2,000 devices, went unused for a period of seven months between 2013 and 2014. The estimated costs of these lost or unused devices is about $1.1 million per year. Best of all, per Wastebook, Hewlett-Packard, the contractor for NASA, ""couldn't accurately account for the full inventory of mobile devices it provides to the Agency."" Not very encouraging.4.

Sounds like a case of sour grapesCollege students across many states, including the University of Tennessee, have been granted $5 million to spread awareness about healthy eating habits.

Western Digital Corp's Top Chinese Investor Is a Growing Tech Beast,"Dec 21, 2015 at 7:14AM","China's Tsinghua Unigroup, the state-controlled company that bought a 15% stake in storage-solutions leader Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) earlier this year, plans to evolve into a chipmaking behemoth during the next few years. Prior to that investment, Unigroup bought Spreadtrum and RDA Microelectronics, two major fabless chipmakers in China, for $2.7 billion.TSINGHUA SCIENCE PARK. SOURCE: PIXABAY.Earlier this year, Unigroup tried to buy U.S. memory-chipmaker Micron for $23 billion, but the deal was blocked by U.S. regulators due to national security concerns. Undeterred, Unigroup recently unveiled plans to buy 25% stakes in three chip test and packaging firms in Taiwan -- ChipMOS Technologies, Silicon Precision Industries, and Powertech Technology -- for $2.6 billion. All three companies welcomed Unigroup's investment, but pro-independence and pro-unification leaders in Taiwan have opposed the deal, citing national security concerns and a potential loss of intellectual property.If those controversial investments are approved, Unigroup could gain ground against its top rivals, American chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek, and South Korean tech giant Samsung. Therefore, tech investors should keep a close eye on Unigroup, and understand how its growth could affect the ability of U.S. chipmakers to compete in China.Why was Tsinghua Unigroup established?Tsinghua Unigroup is 51% owned by Tsinghua Holdings, a conglomerate that is wholly owned by China's elite Tsinghua University. The other 49% is held by Beijing Jiankun Investment Group. Zhao Weiguo, who controls the latter, became the chairman and CEO of Tsinghua Unigroup after the company was privatized in 2010.To strengthen China's domestic chip sector, Unigroup signed major deals with Western chipmakers, tried to consolidate the domestic fabless semiconductor market, and tried to invest in, or acquire, overseas tech companies. In May, Hewlett-Packard agreed to sell a 51% stake in H3C Technologies, its Chinese data networking business, to Unigroup for $2.3 billion. HP also agreed to create a group inside China to house H3C's server, data-storage, and technology-services businesses.The Chinese government hopes that revenues from its domestic chip companies can grow more than 20% annually and become a 350 billion yuan ($54 billion) market by 2020. That growth could help China reduce its dependence on U.S. tech, which the country doesn't like using due to security concerns, while establishing a pillar of growth for its domestic economy.Consolidating the market against QualcommUnigroup has repeatedly declared its intentions to overtake Qualcomm, the largest mobile chipmaker in the world. At the end of 2014, Qualcomm respectively controlled 51% and 64% of the application-processor and wireless-modem markets, according to research firm Strategy Analytics.But by July, Strategy Analytics reported that Qualcomm's share in application processors had slipped to 47%, while MediaTek controlled 15%. In October, the company reported that Qualcomm's share of the wireless modem market had fallen to 60%, compared to 19% for MediaTek, and 6% for Unigroup's Spreadtrum.Investing in, or acquiring, MediaTek could help Unigroup become Qualcomm's biggest competitor. In a recent interview with Taiwan's Commercial Times, Unigroup's Zhao stated that if cross-strait investment rules were relaxed, he planned to meet with MediaTek chairman Tsai Ming-kai to discuss a potential merger between MediaTek, Spreadtrum, and RDA Microelectronics. Such a merger could significantly strengthen MediaTek's position against Qualcomm. MediaTek recently told Taipei Times told the company would adopt an ""open attitude"" toward cooperating with Unigroup.The enemy of my enemy...While regulators in the U.S. and Taiwan have viewed Unigroup's growth with suspicion, the company has welcomed foreign investments. Last September, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) bought 20% stakes in Spreadtrum and RDA through a $1.5 billion investment in Unigroup.Intel invested in those two low-cost chipmakers to gain ground in the mobile market against Qualcomm, which dominates the high-end and mid-range markets with its Snapdragon processors. Intel has gained ground in tablets, but its market share in smartphone application processors and wireless modems remains in the single digits. By teaming up with a state-backed firm and releasing cheap reference designs for low-cost Chinese OEMs, Intel hopes to gain mobile market share in Qualcomm's biggest market.More investments and buyouts aheadQualcomm has recently been struggling all across the world. In China, it was slapped with a $975 million antitrust fine and forced to lower its patent licensing fees for Chinese-made phones. Regulators in South Korea and Taiwan also recently launched similar probes against the company. The European Commission is also investigating allegations that the company used predatory pricing to force rivals out of the market.All this regulatory pressure on Qualcomm is creating an opportunity for Tsinghua Unigroup to catch up. The company has already established footholds in the data-storage, data-center, networking, and low-cost mobile chipmaking markets. If it continues to invest in more chipmakers, it could eventually become China's equivalent of Samsung.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Can You Guess Which Country Has the Most Female Self-Made Billionaires? (Hint: It's Not the U.S.),"Nov 22, 2015 at 8:22AM","The U.S. is the richest nation in the world (for now), and we claim more than twice as many billionaires as the runner-up. And yet we take second place when it comes to the number of female self-made billionaires -- which is surprising for a relatively progressive country that is defined by self-starters who made their own fortunes through hard work and innovation.So who really wants to be a billionaire? Apparently, a lot of women from China.According to the Hurun Research Institute, 49 of the world's 73 self-made female billionaires come from China. Their combined net worth is estimated at $95.4 billion. Meanwhile, there are only 15 in the U.S., with a combined net worth of $28.8 billion. Third on the list is the United Kingdom, with three self-made female billionaires boasting a collective $4.9 billion in wealth.Meet the key playersApparently hard work can pay off in China, too. At age 45, China's Zhou Qunfei is worth $8.3 billion, making her the world's richest self-made woman. Zhou earned her way to the top by founding Lens Technology, a leading manufacturer of glass covers for tablets and mobile phones, in 2003. The company is a major supplier for brands such as Apple and Samsung. Mainland-born Zhou grew up in poverty and began working in the glass industry in 1993. Today, her company has over 60,000 employees.Second to Zhou is 74-year-old Chen Lihua. Known as the Beijing Real Estate Queen, Chen is the founder of Fuwah International Group, one of Beijing's largest commercial property developers. She boasts an impressive net worth of $7.7 billion and was only recently surpassed by Zhou.Real estate is said to be the biggest source of wealth among China's richest females, representing about 25% of those on the current list. The next-largest wealth-creator is investments, accounting for 15% of China's richest women.Although most of its wealthy females surely aren't billionaires, China is rapidly emerging as a leader in women's success stories. In recent years, the number of Chinese women in senior management positions has doubled, with 51% of those coveted high-profile jobs now held by females (versus only 20% in the U.S.). Additionally, about 21% of publicly traded China-based companies have women on their boards. Despite the all-too-common characterization of women as second-class citizens in China, they clearly seem to be rising above and proving their worth in the upper echelons of business.Women still have some catching up to doWhile the ranks of female billionaires are growing on an international level, men are still far ahead on the wealth accumulation front. Of the 1,826 known billionaires in the world, only 197 are women. While that number has increased since last year, when 172 female billionaires were reported, women still make up just 11% of the grand total. Furthermore, among China's richest, the 50 wealthiest men on record surpassed their female counterparts with an aggregate net worth about four times as great.On top of that, only 29 of the world's female billionaires are self-made. The rest inherited their fortunes from the men in their lives, be they husbands or fathers. Christy Walton, the world's richest woman, for example, inherited a stake in Wal-Mart, which explains her estimated net worth of $41.7 billion.That said, the U.S. has its fair share of astounding female success stories. Elizabeth Holmes made her money by founding Theranos, a blood testing company, at age 19. She is reportedly the world's youngest self-made female billionaire, with a net worth of $4.5 billion as of 2014. She is also the richest self-made female in the United States. Other notable examples include Diane Hendricks and Doris Fisher, who rank behind Holmes with respective fortunes of $3.7 billion and $3.1 billion. Hendricks made her money in the roofing business as the co-founder of ABC Supply. Fisher, meanwhile, cofounded the clothing retail giant Gap. Also on the list of self-made U.S. billionaires are Oprah Winfrey, with a net worth of $3 billion, and Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman, with a cool $2.1 billion.So there you have it. Despite the wage gap between men and women, it is possible for women to amass huge fortunes if they have the vision and the willpower it takes. As today's leading self-made women have shown us, when it comes to achieving billionaire status, there's no single formula for success. But if anything, the achievements of Zhou, Chen, Holmes, and others like them should teach women everywhere to aim high and think big."
"Better Buy: HP Inc, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, or Xerox Corp?","Apr 20, 2016 at 10:02PM","Late last year, Hewlett-Packard split into two companies -- HP (NYSE:HPQ) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE). HP kept selling computers, printers, and imaging devices, while HPE sells enterprise hardware and software.Xerox (NYSE:XRX), one of HP's top rivals in printing and imaging, also recently announced that it would by year's end split its hardware and services businesses into two new companies -- a business process outsourcing company and a document and services one.IMAGE SOURCE: XEROX.Piper Jaffray analyst George Tong recently recommended that investors buy shares of Xerox ahead of the split, declaring that a ""sum-of-the-parts"" valuation for both segments gave the stock an equivalent valuation of $14 -- a 25% premium from its current price. But should investors buy Xerox instead of HPE or HP Inc?A brief history of XeroxXerox was founded 110 years ago, but the company didn't become world-famous until it launched its first plain paper photocopier in 1959. It subsequently dominated the imaging device market with color printers, laser printers, and scanners over the following decades. But by the early 2000s, Xerox's bottom line had dipped into the red, cash levels had fallen, and debt levels had risen.To rejuvenate and diversify its business, Xerox acquired services and outsourcing company Affiliated Computer Services (ACS) for $6.4 billion in 2009. But ACS's IT outsourcing business failed to compete effectively against market heavyweights like HP, so Xerox sold the business to French IT services firm Atos SE for $966 million in late 2014. Xerox's new business process outsourcing company will mainly consist of ACS's remaining businesses.But will a split help?As a single company, Xerox's growth has been mediocre. Revenue fell 7.6% annually to $4.65 billion last quarter, missing estimates by $80 million and marking its 15th consecutive quarter of sales declines. Document technology revenue fell 13.1% to $1.88 billion, while equipment sales declined 10% to $770 million. Annuity revenue from contracted services, consumable supplies, and financing services fell 7% to $3.88 billion. Analysts expect Xerox's revenue to continue fading by the single digits over the next few quarters.Yet Xerox's numbers are better than those of HP Inc, which posted a 12% annual revenue decline last quarter as sales of printers and desktops fell by double digits. HPE fared better than both Xerox and HP, with a more moderate 3% sales decline, but its sales were propped up by its acquisition of networking firm Aruba Networks.Xerox's adjusted net income fell 6.7% to $333 million, but its adjusted EPS rose one cent to $0.32 per share (thanks to buybacks) and beat estimates by four cents. Gross and operating margins both declined. Analysts expect Xerox's annual earnings to improve just 3% over the next five years, which gives it a 5-year PEG ratio of 3.4. HP is expected to remain unprofitable during that period, which gives it a negative PEG ratio. HPE is expected to post 2.5% annual earnings growth, which gives it a PEG ratio of 3.7. Therefore, Xerox's shares don't look cheap, but they look cheaper than HP's or HPE's relative to its earnings growth potential.Margins and dividendsXerox plans to cut costs over the next three years to produce $2.4 billion in savings across both companies. $700 million of that total could be realized this year, depending on when the companies officially split. Xerox claims that less than 2% of the workforce will be affected by the split, although its total headcount will continue shrinking, as it has in previous years.On its own, the document technology company is expected to generate annual revenue of around $11 billion, while the business process outsourcing one will generate about $7 billion. Despite the notion that printers and copiers have become a low-margin business, the document tech business finished last quarter with an operating margin of 11.8%, while the outsourcing services business had a margin of 9.4%. By comparison, HP Inc finished last quarter with a GAAP operating margin of 8% from continuing operations, while HPE finished the quarter with a 3% operating margin.Both HP and Xerox have long records of raising their dividends, and the four smaller companies will continue that tradition. HP and HPE respectively pay forward annual dividend yields of 4% and 1.3%, while Xerox currently pays a yield of 2.8%. Since Xerox is splitting its hardware and services businesses in a similar way, the document tech business will likely retain a higher dividend, while the outsourcing services one will pay a lower one.The verdict: Xerox wins, but waiting would be wiseXerox isn't a great growth stock, but it has decent earnings growth potential and a solid dividend. Xerox faces many of the same macro headwinds as HP and HPE, but its lower (albeit not negative) 5-year PEG ratio makes it a slightly more attractive investment than both stocks.However, cautious investors who don't want to own both Xerox companies can wait for the split to conclude before deciding which stock is a better buy. When that happens, I'll come back and compare HP to the document and services half and HPE to the business outsourcing half for clearer apples-to-apples comparisons.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Forget Hewlett-Packard Company: Here Are 2 Better Dividend Stocks,"Mar 28, 2016 at 4:45PM","IMAGE SOURCE: HP.Neither of the two companies that emerged from the split of Hewlett-Packard last year, HP (NYSE:HPQ) or Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), are particularly attractive dividend stocks. HP, which sells personal computers and printers, sports a lofty 4.1% dividend yield, but revenue and profits are slumping. During the first quarter, PC sales fell 13% year over year, and printer sales tumbled 17%. Growth prospects are slim, and while the dividend is easily covered by earnings, a 12% decline in non-GAAP EPS during the first quarter certainly doesn't instill confidence in the company.Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, which focuses on enterprise hardware, software, and services, has a far more attractive business, but a dividend yield of just 1.25% makes the stock a nonstarter for dividend investors. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise may be able to grow its dividend faster than HP, given the growth potential of its various businesses, but the yield is just too meager.Thankfully, there are a couple of other large technology companies, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), that offer far better dividends than either Hewlett-Packard company.International Business MachinesIMAGE SOURCE: IBM.IBM has also been suffering from slumping revenue and profits. During 2015, IBM's revenue declined by 12%, while non-GAAP EPS slumped 10%. The company is currently transitioning its business, shifting resources toward high-growth, high-value opportunities. IBM's strategic imperatives, which include analytics, cloud, mobile, social, and security, collectively grew by 26% during 2015 on an adjusted basis, accounting for 35% of total revenue. The rest of the company, however, is shrinking.IBM's revenue woes are not nearly as bad as they seem. Because IBM is a global company, with revenue recorded in various currencies, the strong U.S. dollar has negatively affected IBM's results. Adjusted for both currency and divestitures, IBM's revenue in 2015 declined by just 1%, a far less dire result. Earnings are affected as well, although IBM doesn't disclose the exact impact. Needless to say, the headline numbers greatly exaggerate the severity of IBM's problems.The good news for dividend investors is that the dividend is well covered by IBM's earnings, even at depressed levels. IBM expects non-GAAP EPS of at least $13.50 in 2016, putting the payout ratio at about 38.5%. This leaves plenty of room for dividend growth, even if earnings growth takes longer-than-expected to return. With 20 consecutive years of dividend increases in the books, IBM is very likely to announce a dividend increase in April.With a dividend yield of about 3.5% and plenty of room for dividend growth, IBM is a far better dividend stock than HP or Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.Cisco SystemsIMAGE SOURCE: CISCO.Hewlett-Packard has long been a distant second in the Ethernet switch market, behind dominant leader Cisco. During the fourth quarter of 2015, Cisco enjoyed a 59.2% share of the Ethernet switching market, dwarfing Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's 9.2% share. For Cisco, switching is its largest segment, accounting for 29.4% of revenue during the company's latest quarter. But Cisco is moving toward becoming a provider of solutions, not just a seller of hardware, and while the company is unlikely to return to the heady growth of the past, Cisco certainly isn't standing still.Major growth areas for Cisco include data center, where the company's line of UCS servers have been growing rapidly in recent years, minus a hiccup during the latest quarter. Cybersecurity is also a significant opportunity for the company, and Cisco has been making a slew of acquisitions in an effort to grow the business. According to Cisco, the cybersecurity market is overcrowded, with the typical large enterprise having over 50 separate security vendors. Consolidation is inevitable, and Cisco is aiming to be one of the major players that emerges.Turning to the dividend, Cisco sports a yield even higher than that of IBM thanks to a recent dividend hike. Along with its latest earnings report, Cisco announced a 24% increase in its quarterly dividend, bringing the stock's yield up to about 3.7%. Cisco's payout ratio is higher than that of IBM, about 47% based on non-GAAP numbers and nearly 60% based on GAAP numbers, meaning that future dividend growth is unlikely to be much faster than earnings growth. But a high yield, dominant core businesses, and the potential for long-term growth makes Cisco a dividend stock to own.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co Launches an Internet of Things Platform,"May 16, 2016 at 10:47AM","Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) recently launched its Internet of Things (IoT) platform for managing a wide array of connected devices. HPE states that the ""universal"" platform will convert data in various formats to more consistent ones for storage and analysis. The software is designed to run across multiple platforms, including on-site servers and public cloud services from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).IMAGE SOURCE: HEWLETT-PACKARD ENTERPRISEOf course, the idea of launching unified ""IoT platforms"" is far from new. Amazon, Microsoft, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and many other tech giants previously launched comparable solutions with similar goals. Will HPE's IoT platform stand out against these rivals, or will it further divide the growing but crowded market?Why HPE needs IoTCisco predicts that the number of connected devices will double from 25 billion in 2015 to 50 billion in 2020 and that the global IoT market will be worth $14.4 trillion by 2022. This makes it an incredibly lucrative ""next frontier"" for aging tech companies dealing with sluggish enterprise demand.Enterprise group (hardware and related services) revenue at HPE rose just 1% year-over-year to $7.1 billion last quarter. Most of that growth came from its acquisition of Aruba Networks, which boosted its networking revenue by 54% annually and offset declining sales of servers, storage devices, and tech services. Launching an IoT platform complements the growth of its networking business by streamlining the connections between its networking hardware and servers. Data collection and analytics can also strengthen its enterprise services division, where sales slid 6% year-over-year to $4.7 billion last quarter.Focusing its efforts on IoT can also help HPE secure a foothold in the public cloud market, which it notably exited last October due to fierce competition from Amazon, Microsoft, and other market leaders. HPE listed automakers, telcos, and energy companies as potential customers for its IoT platform, and is currently bidding for business from an unnamed car company.Too little, too late?While HPE's reasons for launching an IoT platform are sound, the company is arguably arriving a bit late in a crowded market of similar platforms. Cisco recently acquired Jasper Technologies, which also offers a unified IoT platform. By bundling its IoT solutions with its market-leading networking hardware, Cisco can quickly expand its in-house platform and marginalize the competition. Cisco notably used a similar bundling strategy to marginalize Aruba before it was acquired by Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.Microsoft is leveraging its control of Windows to expand the presence of the Azure IoT Suite, which is tightly integrated into its Azure cloud platform. Meanwhile, Amazon is expanding its massive cloud platform AWS (Amazon Web Services) into the IoT market with Kindles, Fire TVs, Echo speakers, Dash buttons, and DRS-enabled smart appliances.AMAZON'S DASH BUTTONS. IMAGE SOURCE: AMAZONHPE lacks Cisco's networking muscle or Microsoft and Amazon's cloud strength. The only major advantage it has is its market-leading position in the data center market. However, HPE doesn't seem interested in competing against Microsoft and Amazon. By making its IoT platform compatible with Azure and AWS, HPE is encouraging compatibility between different standards, which might make its enterprise hardware and software more appealing.Competition creates fragmentationIn a previous article, I discussed the problem of competition leading to fragmentation between communications standards. In the chip-making market, the Intel-led OIC (Open Interconnect Consortium) is challenging Qualcomm's AllSeen Alliance to launch ""universal"" communication standards between IoT devices. The irony is that neither standard is compatible with the other.On the software side, companies like Apple, Alphabet, Samsung, and Amazon are all launching competing physical and digital hubs for smart home ecosystems. As for enterprise IoT analytics solutions, companies have to choose between AWS, Azure, Cisco's built-in analytics software, or other alternatives. All of this competition fragments the market and makes it tough for IoT devices and services to achieve mass adoption.Why HPE has the right ideaHewlett-Packard Enterprise isn't really trying to capture mindshare in the IoT market with its new universal platform. Instead, it could capitalize on the fragmentation of the IoT market by converting the various forms of data into a standardized version for easier analysis. That move could strengthen the bonds between its data center, networking, and software segments, enabling its entire business to tap into the growth of the IoT market.10 stocks we like better than Hewlett Packard EnterpriseWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. or Cisco Systems Inc?,"Mar 22, 2016 at 9:43PM","Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) are both mature tech stocks associated with stable returns instead of explosive growth. The two companies generally aren't considered competitors, but HPE notably became a networking rival to Cisco last year by acquiring Aruba Networks. Will one of these slow-growth tech stocks outperform the other this year? Let's discuss their strengths, weaknesses, and valuations to gain insight.HPE's strengths and weaknessesHewlett-Packard split into two companies last year, with HPE retaining the enterprise hardware and software units and HP (NYSE:HPQ) keeping the PC and printer divisions. Since the two stocks started trading separately last October, HPE shares have gained 5%, while HP shares have dipped 2%.SOURCE: HPE.HPE's revenue fell 3% annually to $12.7 billion last quarter, which narrowly beat expectations by $40 million. Enterprise Group (hardware and related services) revenue rose 1% to $7.1 billion. Within that total, server, storage, and tech services revenue all posted single-digit declines, but networking sales surged 54%, thanks to the Aruba acquisition and strong demand in China. However, enterprise services revenue fell 6% to $4.7 billion due to a loss of market share and the rise of cloud-based IT and business services. Software and financial services revenue also declined.On the bottom line, HPE's non-GAAP net earnings fell 15% to $0.7 billion. However, non-GAAP EPS, inflated by buybacks, only fell 7% to $0.41 and beat estimates by a penny. Job cuts kept operating expenses roughly flat at $12.3 billion. During the conference call (as transcribed by Thomson Reuters), CEO Meg Whitman stated that HPE would launch a ""market-changing"" converged infrastructure platform with integrated server and storage technologies, which would be 20% cheaper than comparable solutions from Nutanix. HP also issued full-year guidance that matched analyst expectations for 2.2% earnings growth.Cisco's strengths and weaknessesCisco shares have remained roughly flat since last October. According to research firm IDC, Cisco controlled 59.2% of the global Ethernet switching market in the fourth quarter of 2015. HPE and Huawei, the second- and third-largest players, respectively controlled 9.2% and 6.1%. One of Cisco's core strategies is to bundle its networking hardware and software solutions into cheaper enterprise packages than smaller players like Aruba.SOURCE: CISCO.Cisco's revenue dipped 0.1% annually to $11.93 billion last quarter, which still topped estimates by $170 million. Excluding the set-top box business it sold to Technicolor, revenue rose 2%. Revenue at Cisco's data center and switching units, which together accounted for over a third of its sales, respectively fell 3% and 4%. However, service provider video sales surged 37% thanks to robust demand in China, security revenue rose 11% due to elevated cyberthreat concerns, collaboration sales improved 3%, and routing sales grew 5%. Cisco estimates that sales for the current quarter will rise 1% to 4% annually, beating expectations for a 1% decline.On the bottom line, Cisco's non-GAAP net income rose 7% annually to $2.9 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share, slightly boosted by buybacks, rose 8% to $0.57 per share and beat expectations by three cents. Cisco expects to post flat to 4% non-GAAP earnings growth for the current quarter, which matches analyst expectations. To strengthen its long-term pipeline, Cisco has acquired a wide variety of security, cloud, and connected device companies over the past few years.Shareholder value and valuationsHPE and Cisco are both shareholder-friendly companies. Last quarter, HPE announced plans to return at least 100% of its estimated free cash flow of $2 to $2.2 billion this year to its shareholders through buybacks and dividends. HPE also expects to gain about $2 billion by selling its 51% stake in its Chinese H3C Technologies unit, which will mostly be spent on buybacks once the deal closes. During the first quarter, HPE spent $1.2 billion on buybacks and nearly $100 million on dividends, and currently pays a forward annual yield of 1.3%.Over the past 12 months, Cisco spent 23% of its FCF on buybacks and 34% on dividends. While that might make Cisco look less ""generous"" than HPE, Cisco pays a higher forward yield of 3.7% and has more cash to spend on acquisitions and dividend hikes.Analysts expect HPE to grow its annual earnings by 2.5% over the next five years, which gives it a 5-year PEG ratio of 3.7. Cisco's earnings are expected to rise 8.2% during that period, which gives it a much lower PEG ratio of 1.5. Neither ratio has fallen beneath the ""undervalued"" threshold of 1, but Cisco looks cheaper compared to its earnings growth potential.The winner: CiscoI'm not a fan of HPE's strategy of relying heavily on buybacks and job cuts to inflate earnings. Newer server tech and its acquisition of Aruba might offset sales declines in other businesses, but its dividend remains too low and its PEG ratio too high compared to Cisco's. So all things considered, Cisco is the better overall pick for stable growth and steady income.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co. or IBM?,"Feb 26, 2016 at 5:30PM","Hewlett-Packard and IBM (NYSE:IBM) are often seen as aging tech giants with stagnant growth. To shake off that stigma, HP recently split into two companies -- the enterprise-focused Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) and the PC and printer vendor HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ). That's also why IBM sold its PC and low-end server businesses to Lenovo, paid GlobalFoundries to take over its chip manufacturing business, and dumped other lower-margin businesses. Let's take a look at how HPE and IBM have fared after those changes, and if either stock has become a decent long-term investment.SOURCE: HEWLETT-PACKARD ENTERPRISE. SOURCE: HPE.HPE's strengths and weaknessesDuring HP's final quarter as a single company, HPE's businesses all posted weak growth due to macro challenges across the enterprise market. Enterprise group revenue from hardware and related services rose 2% annually to $7.4 billion. Revenue from enterprise services, which were hurt by cloud competition and market share loss, slipped 9% to $5 billion. Software revenue declined 7% to $958 million, while financial services revenue fell 11% to $802 million. HPE's total revenue fell 4% annually to $14.1 billion, but still exceeded downbeat analyst estimates by $600 million.Analysts expect HPE's revenue to decline 7% in fiscal 2016, due to the ongoing headwinds facing the enterprise market. HPE's earnings are only expected to grow less than 2% annually over the next five years. However, HPE intends to return over half of its estimated free cash flow in 2016 to shareholders with $400 million in dividends and the rest in buybacks. This indicates that its forward dividend yield of 1.6% could rise, and that its low forward P/E of 7 could be tightened up by a lower share count.IBM's strengths and weaknessesLast quarter, IBM posted its 15th straight quarter of annual sales declines. Tech services revenue fell annually 7.1% to $8.1 billion, business services revenue declined 9.9% to $4.3 billion, software revenue plunged 10.7% to $6.8 billion, and hardware revenue dipped 1.4% to $2.4 billion. Total revenue fell 8.5% to $22.06 billion, narrowly beating expectations by $20 million.IBM's revenue from its higher-growth ""strategic imperatives"" businesses -- cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security -- grew 10% annually. However, that represents a slowdown from 20% and 17% growth in the second and third quarters, respectively. For the full year, strategic imperatives revenue rose 17% and accounted for 35% of IBM's sales. However, these ""strategic"" businesses are all tucked into IBM's other slowing divisions, obfuscating IBM's underlying growth if those five businesses are excluded.Looking ahead, analysts expect Big Blue's sales to fall 4.6% in fiscal 2016, but its earnings are expected to grow 7% annually over the next five years. IBM has slowed down its buybacks, but it still paid out $5 billion in dividends and bought back $4.5 billion in stock over in 2015 -- which used up nearly 70% of its free cash flow. IBM pays a forward annual yield of 3.9% and currently trades at 9 times forward earnings.AN IBM-POWERED DATA CENTER. SOURCE: IBM.How are HPE and IBM different?IBM and HPE's business units seem similar, but there are two key differences. First, HPE continues to sell x86 servers, which IBM no longer sells. Second, IBM remains invested in the public cloud market, but HP shuttered its public cloud platform Helion last October.IBM exited the x86 server business because it was a low-margin one which couldn't compete against market leaders HP and Dell. Likewise, HP exited the public cloud business because it was too capital intensive to compete against top players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, both IBM and HPE remain invested in ""hybrid cloud"" services which bridge the gap between on-site private clouds and public cloud services. These solutions are popular with larger companies which aren't ready or willing to migrate all their data to the public cloud.Which stock has a brighter future?Both HPE and IBM are cheap relative to their industry peers, but I believe that IBM is a better investment because its strategic imperatives are growing in importance, it remains committed to strengthening its public cloud options against Amazon, and it pays a bigger dividend.Meanwhile, HPE hasn't proven that it can thrive as a stand-alone business without the shared cash flows of HP. HPE is a market leader in x86 servers, but sales could continue slowing due to market competition and customized ""white box"" cloud servers. HPE's acquisition of Aruba Networks last year, which boosted its networking hardware presence, could be undermined by market leaders like Cisco . Lastly, HPE might regret its early exit from the public cloud market as services like IBM's Bluemix and Watson experience higher growth than its hybrid cloud efforts. Unless HPE can overcome those challenges, I think investors should stick with Big Blue for now.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2 Stocks With Better Dividends Than HP Inc.,"Feb 1, 2016 at 9:38AM","The tech sector isn't known for its dividends, but those that do exist can be pretty rich. Case in point: HP (NYSE:HPQ), whose $0.50 quarterly dividend yields more than 5% as of the most recent closing stock price.A company's dividend yield, of course, isn't everything. It may be high due to the unpopularity of the stock, or because its issuer has decided to shovel more of its hard-earned cash into shareholder distributions.HP's dividend yields more than many rival tech issues, but this is due more to a low share price than anything else. The company -- the legacy PC and printer business from Hewlett-Packard, which split into two publicly traded entities last November -- sells products that are looking awfully mature, and probably won't grow too strongly. At the same time, it hasn't effectively pounced on new technologies in those categories such as 3D printing.So I think there are better dividend-paying tech stocks for investors to buy, even if their yields aren't necessarily as high as HP's. Here are two that I feel are particularly worthy of consideration at the moment.Cisco SystemsThere are hot young tech companies, and there are more mature incumbents. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) belongs firmly in the second category. It makes products -- chiefly networking components like switches and routers -- that aren't considered particularly cutting edge these days, and its products don't have the wow factor of sharper, more-current technology. But it's a consistently and strongly profitable company that throws off plenty of cash.CSCO CASH FROM OPERATIONS (ANNUAL) DATA BY YCHARTS.Although revenue hasn't moved up dynamically during the past few years, some of its younger product lines are starting to produce meaningful growth.One is the data-center segment, the sales of which booked a 24% year-over-year gain in Q1 FY 2016, to nearly $860 million. Another is collaboration solutions, which improved by 17%, to land at more than $1 billion. Those aren't yet big enough numbers to give a serious boost to revenue -- total for the quarter: $12.7 billion -- but if the company can keep up those growth rates, it has the potential to get meaningful in a hurry.At the same time, the top line for Cisco's core-switching category is also rising slowly and steadily. It recorded a 5% sales gain in the quarter, to just more than $4 billion.Cisco probably won't zoom ahead in the coming days, weeks, or even months -- those newish divisions need more time to grow. The company's guidance for the current quarter was tepid, and the shares have traded down since. But that means they're a nice buying opportunity -- just now, they trade at a trailing-12-month price-earnings of less than 13, giving plenty of upside potential. And a lower price means a fatter yield: Cisco's is currently a juicy 3.6%.GarminOne veteran tech stock on the ignore list of many investors is Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN). Once upon a time, the company was a top name in GPS devices, a market that has been driven toward obsolescence by smartphone apps. Who needs a stand-alone GPS when an iPhone will guide you to your destination with turn-by-turn voice directions?But Garmin hasn't lost its way. It's built on its existing technological foundation to broaden its product line beyond vehicle guidance offerings (although those, in new-generation configurations, are still being made). It's got a raft of products that address the current market for wearable tech, such as fitness trackers and the Internet of things. Its products have received very good reviews for their accuracy and functionality.Several of those lines have stiff competition, but Garmin's got a lot of variety spread across its five business segments. On the back of that, it has managed to grow sales. In the company's most recently reported fiscal year, 2014, it booked a 9% annual improvement in top line -- to nearly $2.9 billion, its highest figure in years.GRMN REVENUE (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.Like Cisco, Garmin trades at a trailing 12-month P/E of less than 13. That's cheap for a company that's active in numerous useful consumer tech categories. It tends to spend much of its free cash flow on dividends; but in my opinion, it should be able to maintain FCF at or above current levels. That's good for stockholders, as the current $0.51 per share quarterly payout yields a chunky 6%."
"Meet Dion Weisler, HP Inc.'s Low-Profile CEO","Feb 13, 2016 at 2:00PM","HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) announced Wednesday that it will report results for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Jan. 31, on Feb. 24. CEO Dion Weisler participated in HP's last four conference calls, but this is the first full quarter in which he has headed an HP Inc. operating separately from Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE). Just what do we know about him?HP CEO DION WEISLER. SOURCE: LENOVOPHOTOLIBRARY, REPUBLISHED UNDER CC BY-ND 2.0.For an executive at the helm of a technology institution -- not to mention a business that did over $50 billion in sales last year -- Weisler, an Australian, has kept a very low profile both in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street.Dion who?Indeed, a search for his name in The New York Times' database produced only three articles, the oldest of which was dated Oct. 2014, when Hewlett-Packard announced it would break itself up, with Weisler tapped to lead one of the two resulting companies.The same search on Barron's turned up nine mentions, but none prior to Oct. 2014. Even The Financial Times, which has superior coverage of companies outside the U.S., turned up just eight articles.That's not entirely surprising since Weisler has spent the bulk of his 25-year career in the IT industry outside of the United States.One thing is certain: Weisler is a tested veteran of the hardware business, having joined HP from Lenovo, where he was chief operating officer of one of their units. He also spent 11 years at Acer, where he rose to managing director of Acer UK. (That title in the U.K. is equivalent to CEO.)In addition, he has operating experience in multiple geographies, from the U.K. to Central/ Eastern Europe and Asia-Pacific/Japan from India to New Zealand.A fast track to the topWeisler enjoyed a fast track to the top of HP, having joined the company four years ago. He was then responsible for the printing and personal systems group in the Asia-Pacific and Japan region. Within 18 months, he was heading the group globally, with responsibility for the largest share of HP's revenues of any executive. From there, he was the natural choice to head HP once the enterprise activity was spun out to form HP Enterprise.What do we know about him as a manager? Going by his participation in the conference calls, he is not immune to speaking in corporate gobbledygook.However, in his case, that does not appear to be a smokescreen to conceal a lack of vision or a confused strategy. Furthermore, Weisler appears to have a very keen focus on satisfying his customers. For example, at an HP company conference in May 2012, he explained that one of his first actions was to open a China development ""that is focused on designing products in China for China.""Getting your hands dirty to win the businessFurthermore, armed with a bachelor's degree in applied science in computing, he is not an executive who shies away from the ""shop floor"". According to Bloomberg, upon joining HP, he won the firm a contract to supply 1.5 million PCs to a customer in India -- a contract HP had not intended to bid on because it was loss-making.Weisler demanded a detailed bill of materials, then began systematically wringing costs out of it by going through every line item. By the end of the exercise, his team had reduced the PC's manufacturing cost by $67.40 apiece -- enough to turn a loss-making contract into a profitable one.Heading a computer hardware business -- even one with a storied name like HP -- Dion Weisler certainly has work cut out for him. It's a brutally competitive industry in which earning a return for shareholders is a real challenge. However, from this columnist's perspective, if anyone is up for that challenge it's Weisler, who has the right combination of attributes experience for the job.Now that he no longer reports to anyone in the corporate hierarchy (except for the board, of course), he has full freedom to lead a focused HP. This month's earnings presentation will be a good opportunity for analysts and shareholders to get a better measure of the man and his plans for HP."
HP Enterprise and Computer Sciences Corp. Surge on Spin-off and Merger,"May 25, 2016 at 1:28PM","IMAGE SOURCE: HP ENTERPRISE.What: Shares of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) and Computer Sciences Corp. (NYSE:CSC) soared on Wednesday following the announcement that the former's enterprise services unit would be spun off and merged with the latter. At 11:45 a.m. EDT, shares of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise were up about 9.5%, while shares of Computer Sciences had surged 35%.So what: At the close of the transaction, which is expected by March 31, 2017, the company created by the merger will be a pure-play IT services company with roughly $26 billion of annual revenue. HP Enterprise will be left as an enterprise hardware company, selling servers, networking gear, and other products. The spin-off and merger are expected to be tax-free, and HP Enterprise shareholders will own approximately 50% of the new combined company when the deal closes.The deal will allow HP Enterprise to reduce its workforce by about 100,000 employees, or two-thirds of its current total. The new combined company will increase its scale dramatically compared to Computer Sciences, which reported just $11.3 billion of revenue over the past 12 months.HP Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman summed up the benefits of the deal:""As two stand-alone companies with global scale, strong balance sheets and focused innovation pipelines, both HPE and the new company that combines CSC and HPE's Enterprise Services segment will be well positioned as leaders in their respective markets. For HPE, our balance sheet, capital allocation strategy, and cost structure will now be fully optimized for a faster growing, higher margin and more robust free cash flow business. And, the new company will be in a stronger position to win than either organization could have been on its own.""Now what: By jettisoning its enterprise services business, HP Enterprise is taking the exact opposite approach compared to Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), a rival in the networking hardware business. Cisco is, in fact, doubling down on both software and services, which will be two of the main growth drivers for the company going forward. Whether HP Enterprise's focus on hardware will prove to be a better strategy than Cisco's integrated approach remains to be seen.Computer Sciences has been struggling with slumping revenue following its separation from its former public sector division, and this deal should be beneficial, giving the company much greater scale. Investors are certainly on board, with shares of Computer Sciences adjusted for the previous separation reaching their highest level since the dot-com boom.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2 Cybersecurity Stocks That Might Make You Rich,"Apr 22, 2016 at 8:54AM","This article was originally published on April 22, 2016 and updated on March 8, 2017.Back in 2015, Steve Wozniak told Lateline that ""cyber attacks and hacking"" were ""getting worse and worse year by year."" He's right: The Identity Theft Resource Center and CyberScout reported that data breaches surged 40% to a historic high in 2016. That's why research firm Markets and Markets believes that the global cybersecurity market will grow from $106.3 billion in 2015 to $170.2 billion by 2020.IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.Many cybersecurity stocks have fallen from their all-time highs, presumably due to their high valuations, competitive threats, and a slowdown in enterprise spending. But as markets stabilize, investors should check out two beaten-down cybersecurity stocks -- FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) -- which might rebound in the near future.FireEyeUnlike many other cybersecurity companies which identify threats after they strike, FireEye offers threat prevention services. The company was the first threat prevention firm to be certified by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and was tasked with investigating several major data breach incidents across the country. That ""best in breed"" reputation helped FireEye secure major partnerships with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP), F5 Networks, and Visa over the past year.FireEye's sales stayed nearly flat at $184.7 million last quarter, which was a major slowdown from 13% growth in the previous quarter and 42% growth a year earlier. Looking ahead, analysts expect FireEye's sales to rise 1% this year, compared to 15% growth in 2016.Those numbers sound bleak, but that steep slowdown was mainly caused by the company pivoting away from on-site appliances toward cloud-based services. Those services generate more stable subscription revenues, and the company is unifying them on a single platform called Helix. If that effort pays off, its top line growth should accelerate again.FireEye currently trades at 2.6 times trailing sales -- which is lower than the software industry average of 3.1, as well as leading firewall maker Palo Alto Networks' (NYSE:PANW) P/S ratio of 6.8. FireEye is also trading roughly nearly 50% below its IPO price of $20.Those low valuations make FireEye a potential takeover target for any company looking to bolster its threat detection capabilities -- which could provide current investors with a nice boost. FireEye isn't profitable, but the company believes that its losses will narrow as it reduces the size of its workforce and implements other cost-cutting measures.However, investors should note that bigger rivals like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Palo Alto are both expanding aggressively into the threat prevention space. That aggression could force FireEye to increase its spending and buy more companies -- like its recent acquisitions of cybersecurity peers iSIGHT and Invotas -- to stay competitive.IMAGE SOURCE: FIREEYE.CyberArkCyberArk's software protects ""privileged"" accounts, which are often exploited to gain access to sensitive data. It also isolates threats once they breach a company's firewalls by locking down compromised computers or networks. Like FireEye, CyberArk has a ""best in breed"" reputation at what it does -- 45% of the Fortune 100 and over 25% of the Global 2000 use its services.CyberArk's revenue rose 25% annually to $64.4 million last quarter, compared to 37% growth in the previous quarter and 42% growth a year earlier. License revenue -- which supports its maintenance and services revenue -- rose 23% to $40.8 million, compared to 34% growth in the previous quarter. Looking ahead, CyberArk expects 23%-25% revenue growth for the full year.CyberArk's P/S ratio has declined from about 15 at the beginning of 2016 to just 7.7. That doesn't seem ""cheap"", but what makes CyberArk stand out is its financial discipline and focus on profitability. Its GAAP net income rose 3% annually to $10.2 million last quarter, while its non-GAAP net income grew 7% to $14.7 million. Analysts currently expect CyberArk to post 20% annual earnings growth over the next five years.Looking ahead, CyberArk faces the same threat as FireEye -- bigger companies could bundle similar services into their hardware or software products. But like FireEye, CyberArk has been widening its moat by buying smaller security firms like Viewfinity.High risks, high rewardsFireEye and CyberArk are both volatile stocks which aren't for risk-averse investors. But investors willing to ride out the near-term volatility could be richly rewarded over the next few years as companies boost their cybersecurity budgets to defend against hacks and data breaches.There's also a strong possibility that both companies will be acquired by larger firms. Cisco was once rumored to be interested in FireEye, and CheckPoint reportedly held talks to buy CyberArk in the past. Therefore, I think it's a good idea to keep a small portion of your portfolio reserved for either company -- but do your own due diligence before doing so.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Read This Before Investing In Cybersecurity Stocks,"May 12, 2016 at 6:51PM","Cybersecurity has become a hot business over the past few years due to a surge in cyber attacks and data breaches. The Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) reports that the number of personal records exposed in data breaches nearly doubled last year to 169 million across the enterprise, healthcare, government, educational, and financial sectors.Yet cybersecurity stocks have fared poorly this year, with the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF (NYSEMKT:HACK) -- which owns a wide variety of cybersecurity stocks -- sliding more than 20% over the past 12 months. That sectorwide decline has revealed some lucrative long-term investment opportunities, but investors should understand the basics of the cybersecurity industry first.IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.Market growth potentialResearch firm Markets and Markets expects the global cybersecurity market to grow from $106.3 billion to $170.2 billion in 2020. Last December, a survey by Wakefield Research found that 81% of 700 IT decision makers at SMBs planned to boost their annual IT security budget by an average of 22% in 2016.Governments, which accounted for 8% of all data breaches last year in the ITRC report, are also facing pressure to increase cybersecurity spending. Earlier this year, the Obama administration proposed increasing federal cybersecurity spending by $5 billion to $19 billion in 2017. Therefore, businesses and governments might reduce spending in other areas, but cybersecurity spending will likely climb as cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated.External and internal threatsCybersecurity companies are generally split into two categories -- those which protect a network from external threats, and those that deal with internal ones.Companies that deal with external threats create firewalls, threat prevention systems, antivirus software, and other security solutions. ""Best in breed"" players in this market include firewall providers Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and Check Point, threat prevention leader FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), antivirus maker Symantec, and networking giant Cisco's bundled security solutions.Companies that tackle internal threats offer network monitoring solutions. Key players in this market include IT giants IBM and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, IT management software provider CA, cloud-based security firms Splunk and Imperva, and privileged accounts protector CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR).A key threat facing many smaller players in both markets is that larger players like IBM, Cisco, and HPE are bundling more of their own security services into their hardware and services. If that happens, companies which don't have a well-protected niche (like CyberArk in privileged accounts) could be wiped out, while companies which dominate specific niches could be acquired.Common financial themesInvestors will also notice some common financial themes across the cybersecurity industry. First, it's common for these companies to generate double or triple-digit sales growth for multiple quarters. Palo Alto has delivered over 50% annual sales growth every quarter since the fourth quarter of 2014. FireEye's revenue rose 34% last quarter, while CyberArk's improved 42%.But sales growth isn't everything. Most companies split their revenue into product and services. Product (or license) revenue growth is considered more important, since companies must keep selling new licenses for their products to generate recurring services revenue from subscriptions and maintenance fees. Product revenue growth outpacing total revenue growth is considered a strong positive indicator of future growth.However, many cybersecurity companies are deeply unprofitable due to high stock-based compensation expenses and rapid cash burn rates. Many cybersecurity companies -- including Palo Alto, FireEye, and CyberArk -- used secondary offerings to raise cash, which diluted shares for existing investors. Some companies, like CyberArk, have since become profitable on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis by reining in their spending. Others, like FireEye, remain unprofitable by both measures.Therefore, investors should look closely at these companies' cash positions and the reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP profits. For example, Palo Alto -- which is profitable on a non-GAAP basis -- is unprofitable on a GAAP basis due to stock-based compensation expenses, which soared 76% annually last quarter and swallowed up nearly a third of its revenue.A volatile but promising marketInvestors seemed to sell many cybersecurity stocks over the past year due to concerns regarding softer enterprise spending and competition. But I believe that fears about enterprise spending are unjustified, since companies are realizing that the brand damage caused by data breaches far outweighs the cost of solid protection. Competition is worrisome, but only for certain companies which don't dominate niches, lack growth, and aren't considered ""best in breed"" players.Cybersecurity stocks certainly aren't for risk averse investors. But investors who can stomach the volatility could generate big returns within the next few years by investing in the right players in this promising market."
The 2 Biggest Threats to Barracuda Networks Inc Stock,"Apr 24, 2016 at 9:45AM","I recently weighed the pros and cons of buying shares of security and storage appliance vendor Barracuda Networks (NYSE:CUDA). In that article, I concluded that Barracuda would likely be marginalized by larger companies, which would cause billings and subscriber renewals to decline. It also seemed like the company has thrown in the towel by trying to sell itself, but a potential suitor has yet to emerge.With its fiscal fourth quarter earnings report right around the corner, we should take a look at the two biggest threats facing Barracuda today, and whether or not those challenges will cause it to miss expectations.IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY1. Bigger security and storage playersThe biggest threat to Barracuda today is competition. The company is fairly small, with an enterprise value of $680 million, yet its revenue is growing at a much slower rate than bigger direct competitors in the security space like Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and Imperva (NASDAQ:IMPV). Barracuda's quarterly revenue has risen between 14% to 19% annually over the past four quarters, compared to more than 50% growth for Palo Alto and around 40% for Imperva. Barracuda expects sales to rise just 11% to 14% for the current quarter.In its most recent 10-K filing, Barracuda warns that the company faces ""intense competition in the security and storage markets"" and that it expects ""competition to increase in the future from larger, well-established competitors and new market entrants."" The company classifies these competitors into two groups. The first group consists of ""independent network security, storage and application delivery vendors"" like Imperva, Palo Alto, Check Point Software, and F5 Networks. The second group includes ""diversified IT suppliers"" like Cisco and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.Barracuda warns that many of these larger players ""have acquired large security specialist vendors in recent years."" Cisco, for example, now bundles networking hardware and security solutions into its UCS (unified computing systems) for data centers. Hewlett-Packard acquired Aruba Networks last year to complement its enterprise storage business with networking hardware and services. These moves make it tough for any cybersecurity company which isn't classified as a ""best in breed"" solution to remain competitive. To make matters worse, Barracuda is heavily dependent on sales of physical storage and security appliances -- a market which is losing ground to virtual and cloud-based solutions.2. A lack of suitorsBarracuda's most attractive quality is its low enterprise value and valuation. Its EV/sales ratio of 2.2 is considerably lower than Palo Alto's ratio of 10.9 and Imperva's ratio of 5.2. That's probably why the company reportedly started working with Morgan Stanley in February to find a buyer. Unfortunately, Barracuda is a slow-growth underdog in a market that values high-growth ""best in breed"" leaders.While it's true that a market consolidation of the fragmented security and storage market will likely occur in the near future, there are also simply more promising targets for buyers to consider. FireEye, which offers a ""best in breed"" threat prevention solution certified by the Department of Homeland Security, currently trades below its IPO price with an enterprise value of $2.3 billion. Persistent rumors have suggested that Cisco or Hewlett-Packard could acquire it in the near future. Back in January, Check Point was reportedly holding acquisition talks with CyberArk, another ""best in breed"" player which protects privileged accounts for 40% of the Fortune 100 companies. CyberArk has an enterprise value of just $930 million and is profitable on a GAAP basis -- unlike Barracuda, which will likely remain unprofitable for the foreseeable future.With higher-growth companies like FireEye and CyberArk topping larger companies' list of potential security-related acquisitions, Barracuda simply doesn't seem like a great deal. If Barracuda doesn't get acquired, it could give up most of its 50%+ gains from the past three months, which were mainly fueled by those buyout hopes.The key takeawayBarracuda is a company that faces serious headwinds which won't dissipate anytime soon.

HP First-Quarter Earnings Preview: Streamlined and Seeking Growth,"Feb 23, 2016 at 7:41PM","Hardware manufacturer HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) reports results for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Jan. 31, after Wednesday's market close. This is the first full quarter during which HP has operated independently of its enterprise business, which it spun off into Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co. (NYSE:HPE) on Nov. 2. In other words, there are no more sexy enterprise activities to distract analysts and investors from what remains a good franchise but one that operates in a very difficult market.A STABILIZATION IN PRINTING SYSTEMS REVENUE COULD BE A CATALYST FOR SHARE GAINS.HP must prove itselfThe market already seems to have cast its vote: The graph below shows how the shares have performed versus those of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise since the spin-off date.(The orange line represents the Technology Select SPDR Fund ETF (NYSEMKT:XLK), which tracks the S&P 500 Technology sector.)HPE DATA BY YCHARTS.What to watch: Revenue growthThe top line will be critical, and, more specifically, top-line growth. When one speaks to HP, one is forced to use the term ""growth"" algebraically (i.e., growth can be positive or negative); indeed, HP has managed to produce positive year-over-year growth in just two of the last 16 quarters.That weighs mightily on sentiment. It is always going to be more difficult to convince investors to bet on a declining business, regardless of the price. (This same issue has been weighing on the shares of another technology institution, International Business Machines Corp.)On the current consensus estimate of $12.163 billion, revenue is expected to decline 11.5% year over year. The company has not provided any guidance on revenue whatsoever, neither for the first quarter nor for fiscal 2016, but the full-year consensus estimate of $47.842 billion implies a 9.2% contraction.As I argued in this article, the printing segment -- which has recorded 17 consecutive quarters with declining revenue -- will bear particular scrutiny.A new CEO but hardly untestedThis is HP CEO Dion Weisler's first opportunity to lead a conference call without sharing the spotlight with former HP and current Hewlett-Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman, who is well-known in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street.As such, this is Weisler's opportunity to present his vision for the company he now leads, as well as a narrative for Wall Street. My review of his background and accomplishments for this short profile left me with a very favorable impression of this highly capable proven operator.Weisler is a chief executive and an Australian, to boot, so you should expect a sunny outlook for HP's prospects (in relative terms, at least) -- but not one that is completely out of touch with the reality of the marketplace. By all accounts, this is not a ""helicopter view"" executive. Weisler likes to remain well-grounded in the business.Speaking at the company's analyst day last September, he commented that ""executing on our strategy will produce reliable returns and cash flows while also having the opportunity for long-term growth."" The first part of the sentence suggests Weisler understands HP's investor appeal, but I'll certainly be curious to hear more about the ""opportunity for long-term growth."" Specifically, what are his plans for developing the 3D printing business?10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

HP Launches Speedy Production-Grade 3D Printer: What 3D-Printing Stock Investors Should Know,"May 21, 2016 at 9:05AM","HP'S LOGO DEPICTING VOXELS. THE COMPANY'S MULTI JET FUSION 3D PRINTING TECH PRINTS AT THE VOXEL LEVEL. IMAGE SOURCE: HP INC.The highly anticipated day in the 3D printing world arrived on Tuesday, when 2D-printing king HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) unveiled at RAPID, one of the world's largest industry conferences, its speedy polymer commercial 3D printer, the Jet Fusion 3D 3200. The company's now taking orders for the 3200, which will be available in late 2016, while its more powerful sibling, the 4200, will follow in 2017. It also announced a bevy of A-list partners, including Nike (NYSE:NKE) and BMW (NASDAQOTH:BAMXF).The Jet Fusion 3200 is reportedly up to 10 times faster than printers powered by the leading 3D-printing technologies, fused deposition modeling (FDM) and selective laser sintering (SLS). It's also reportedly the first commercial 3D printer based on an open software and materials platform. So HP's business model is markedly different than the proprietary razor-and-blades-like model employed by leading 3D printing companies 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS).Here's what investors in 3D Systems, Stratasys, and other 3D printing stocks should know.IMAGE SOURCE: HP INC.HP's Jet Fusion 3D 3200 and 4200HP is touting its Jet Fusion 3200 printer as ideal for prototyping, and the more powerful 4200 for prototyping and short-run manufacturing applications. The 4200 is fast enough to meet same-day production demands, according to HP. Beyond being speedy, these 3D printers sport high precision and resolution capabilities -- with brilliant color capabilities on the docket. The company offers software, a processing station with fast cooling, and materials for both models.Pricing for the Jet Fusion 3D 3200 printer starts at $130,000, while the full solution (which includes the processing station) starts at $155,000.MaterialsWhile HP plans to expand its materials offerings, only one material is now available, according to the spec sheet -- PA12 (polyamide 12), commonly called Nylon 12. Moreover, this material currently only comes in black. (And no, this hasn't been well publicized or reported.) Nylon 12 is an engineering thermoplastic that's tough. It can be used to produce components that need to withstand high vibration, repetitive stress, fatigue, and/or chemical exposure. Multi Jet Fusion's secret sauce: Voxel-level printingHP's MJF tech owes its superior speed and other standout features to the fact that it prints at the individual voxel level. (A voxel is the 3D equivalent of a 2D pixel in traditional printing.) Voxel-level printing will allow for limitless combinations of colors and materials, providing customers with unprecedented customization capabilities, according to HP.The company believes unique applications lie on the horizon, providing the following examples as possibilities: Printing with embedded intelligence, like sensors in parts, as part of the Internet of Things.Printing of parts with embedded information, like invisible traces or codes, to deliver a future of increased security and tracking for reinventing supply chains.""Our 3D printing platform is unique in its ability to address over 340 million voxels per second, versus one point at a time, giving our prototyping and manufacturing partners radically faster build speeds, functional parts and breakthrough economics,"" said Stephen Nigro, president of HP's 3D printing business. IMAGE SOURCE: HP INC.A-list partners and target marketsHP's list of partners includes Nike, BMW, Autodesk, Jabil Circuit, Johnson & Johnson, Materialise, Proto Labs, Shapeways, and Siemens. All but Shapeways, a 3D-printing services operation, are publicly traded. So some developments arising from these partnerships could interest investors.Athletic apparel and shoe goliath Nike has used 3D printing for prototyping for many years, and announced last November that it planned to expand its use of this innovative tech. Top management said that custom 3D-printed athletic shoes -- beyond extremely limited-edition ones for pro athletes -- are on the horizon.German luxury automaker BMW has long used the tech for prototyping in concept cars and approval builds. It said in HP's press release that it sees major potential in the partnership for its ""future roadmap toward serial part production and personal customization.""Healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson is exploring the use of 3D printing in its medical-devices business, and announced in January that it's collaborating with start-up Carbon (formerly Carbon3D) to develop custom 3D-printed surgical devices. (To great fanfare, Carbon launched its super-fast M1 3D printer, powered by its compelling Continuous Liquid Interface Production tech, last month.)Rounding out manufacturing partners are Jabil, one of the world's largest contract manufacturers, and Proto Labs, a quick-turn contract manufacturer focused on prototyping and short-run production. Jabil made news last month when Stratasys' MakerBot announced that it had contracted with the company to produce its desktop 3D printers.The team-ups with ProtoLabs, Jabil, and Shapeways reflect HP's targeting of 3D-printing services operations. (It's also targeting model shops.) These businesses are ""technology agnostic"" -- their top interest is having the best equipment available for their customers' needs.These partnerships could eat into Stratasys' and 3D Systems' businesses, as some jobs that used to be produced on their printers could transition to HP's 3D printers. Moreover, 3D Systems and Stratasys also have significant 3D-printing services operations; it should be interesting to see whether either, or both, eventually include HP 3D printers in their facilities. Open platform could unleash 3D printing adoption and innovationHP's Jet Fusion 3D printers are built on an open software and materials platform, which the company believes will help drive 3D-printing adoption by lowering costs and unleashing innovation. The company is creating a 3D-material app store, and is currently collaborating with certified partners, including Arkema, BASF, Evonik, and Lehmann & Voss, and plans to further open up its ecosystem. On the software end, HP worked with industry leaders Autodesk, Materialise, and Siemens to make the design-to-print process easier and more intuitive. 3D-printing software is currently getting much-needed increased attention, with Stratasys, for example, announcing this week a stepped-up new software initiative. HP's open-platform business model differs from the proprietary razor-and-blades-like model employed by 3D Systems and Stratasys. Such a model results in an outsize percentage -- relative to revenue -- of profits generated from sales of materials, or ""blades."" These models can be lucrative when they're working well, but they can stumble when disruptors enter the market with a compelling ""razor"" that uses less-expensive ""blades."" Wrap-upHP's Jet Fusion 3D printers appear to provide the company with the potential to take some business away from 3D Systems and Stratasys, both of which are heavily involved in the polymer 3D-prototyping market, and to a lesser degree, in the short-run production space. Given their relative fast speeds, they also could increase the size of the entire market, as speed has been a top hurdle holding 3D printing back from expanding beyond prototyping into a greater array of manufacturing applications. While HP's Multi Jet Fusion tech appears to have major disruptive potential, it doesn't seem likely that any single 3D-printing technology will ever be the best fit for all applications involving polymers. We'll need to wait to see how satisfied early-paying customers are with HP's 3D printer, and how well the company executes to draw more definitive conclusions. Investors, however, shouldn't underestimate HP's threat, especially given its very deep pockets."
Where Does IBM Rank in Software and Hardware?,"Jun 1, 2016 at 9:00AM","International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is a complicated company. IBM sells hardware, including mainframe systems, Power servers, and storage; it provides a vast array of IT services across the globe, and it sells billions of dollars' worth of software each year. About 80% of its revenue comes from clients that use multiple IBM products and services, with the company's strategy of providing integrated solutions the key to its exceptional profitability.There's no other company that does exactly what IBM does, and that makes comparing it to other technology companies difficult. IBM is worth more with all of its businesses working together rather than separately, a lesson learned during the company's near-death experience and subsequent turnaround in the early 1990s. But it can still be useful for investors to see exactly where IBM stacks up in certain areas.A software juggernautIMAGE SOURCE: IBM.During 2015, IBM generated $22.9 billion from software sales. Most of this revenue, about $19.5 billion, came from middleware, which is software that acts as the glue between other pieces of software. Another $1.8 billion came from operating systems, while the remaining $1.6 billion was derived from other products.If IBM's software segment were a stand-alone company, it would be the fourth-largest software company in the world. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reigns supreme, with Windows, Office, and its many other billion-dollar software businesses putting the company far in the lead. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is in second, with its database products continuing to generate outsized profits for the company. And SAP (NYSE:SAP), with its broad set of software products, is in third.CompanyFiscal 2015 RevenueFiscal 2015 Operating ProfitMicrosoft$93.6 billion30.1%Oracle$38.2 billion36.8%SAP$23.2 billion23.4%IBM Software$22.9 billion34.6%OPERATING PROFIT FIGURES EXCLUDE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. DATA SOURCES: MICROSOFT, ORACLE, SAP, AND IBM.IBM's software sales have been declining in recent years. The impact of currency fluctuations is one reason, with IBM's total revenue growth in 2015 negatively impacted by 8 percentage points because of a strong U.S. dollar. Another factor is the company's shift toward offering software as a service, which tends to push revenue recognition into the future. At the end of 2015, IBM's as-a-service annual run rate, which includes software as well as cloud infrastructure, reached $4.5 billion.Despite the transition going on at IBM, the company's software business is still immensely profitable for the company.A major server vendorIMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Hardware represents a relatively small percentage of IBM's revenue, but it's still an important contributor to the company's success. Following the sale of its x86 server business in 2014, IBM's systems business is left with mainframes and Power servers.During the fourth quarter of 2015, IBM claimed the No. 3 spot in the global server market, according to IDC. HP Enterprise was the clear leader, followed by Dell, IBM, Lenovo, and networking giant Cisco.Company4Q 2015 Market ShareGrowth (YOY)HP Enterprise24.9%(2.1%)Dell16.7%5.3%IBM14.1%8.9%Lenovo7.4%3.7%Cisco6.1%20.6%DATA SOURCE: IDC. YOY = YEAR OVER YEAR.IBM posted strong server revenue growth during the quarter, driven by both its mainframe systems and its Power systems. Mainframe sales are highly cyclical, spiking when a new system is introduced and falling off rapidly after a few quarters, so IBM's share will fluctuate going forward. Mainframe sales declined during the first quarter of this year, following exactly this pattern.IBM is the only top-five server vendor that doesn't sell x86 servers. The company is instead working to make its POWER processors a viable alternative to x86 chips in the hyperscale data center market through the OpenPOWER Foundation, which includes about 150 other companies. Progress has been slow over the past few years, but momentum is starting to build. In April, Alphabet's Google announced it was developing a server architecture based on IBM's POWER processors, a move that could mark the beginning of the end of Intel's uncontested dominance in the data center.IBM is a lot more than a software and hardware company, especially considering the company's heavy investments in cloud computing. But comparing IBM's cloud business to those of other cloud computing giants is difficult. IBM doesn't break out infrastructure-as-a-service revenue explicitly, and neither does Microsoft or Google. This comparison wouldn't be all that relevant, though, since IBM's cloud computing strategy is far deeper than simply aiming to be a IaaS provider.IBM is a company in transition. Resources are being shifted toward high-growth areas like cloud computing and analytics, and legacy businesses with poor growth prospects are in decline. Still, IBM remains a major force in the software market, and its position in the hardware market could improve as the OpenPOWER initiative matures.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3D Systems Corporation's New CEO Could Make $23.3 Million in Three Years,"Apr 22, 2016 at 10:15AM","VYOMESH JOSHI WAS APPOINTED AS 3D SYSTEMS' PERMANENT CEO ON APRIL 1. IMAGE SOURCE: LINKEDIN. 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) ended what turned out to be a six-month search for a new CEO on April 1, when it announced that Vyomesh Joshi was appointed as permanent CEO. Prior to joining 3D Systems, he worked at HP from 1980 to 2012, and retired as executive vice president of HP's imaging and printer group and part of its executive council. While leading HP's $26 billion printing business, he was responsible for doubling the unit's operating profits during an 11-year period.On paper, he has a proven track record of driving meaningful growth over a longer-term period, which seems like an ideal candidate for 3D Systems, a company that's struggled with execution and performance in recent years. But before investors give Joshi the nod of approval, the price that 3D Systems paid to attract this talent should also be taken into consideration.CEO perksWithin an SEC filing, 3D Systems outlined Joshi's compensation package. There's a lot to unpack:Form of CompensationEstimated Value*TermsAnnual salary$925,000Reviewed annually for increaseAnnual cash bonus potential$925,000Up to 100% of annual salaryOption to buy 250,000 shares at $15.85 and if stock trades over $30$3.5 million (if exercised and sold at $30)Stock must trade over $30 for 90 consecutive days50,000 restricted stock shares that vest if stock reaches $30$1.45 millionStock must trade over $30 for 90 consecutive daysOption to buy 250,000 shares at $15.85 and if stock trades over $40$6 million (if exercised and sold at $40)Stock must trade over $40 for 90 consecutive days25,000 restricted stock shares that vest if stock reaches $40$975,000Stock must trade over $40 for 90 consecutive days150,000 restricted stock shares$5.85 million (at $40 per share)Vests annually in equal installments over three yearsDATA SOURCE: SEC FILINGS. *EXCLUDES COST OF $1.00 PER SHARE TO ACQUIRE RESTRICTED STOCK AND $15.85 COST PER SHARE TO EXERCISE OPTIONS.If he meets all of these requirements and doesn't sell any the 150,000 restricted stock shares until the stock reaches $40, he could earn approximately $23.3 million in total compensation in three years.How does this compare to Avi Reichental?3D Systems' former CEO, Avi Reichental, earned nearly $24.5 million in total compensation during his last three full years -- 2012, 2013, and 2014. In 2015, Reichental earned a little over $1 million in total compensation, almost $2 million in severance, and surrendered 425,000 shares of unvested restricted stock worth about $4.4 million at the time of his resignation.Year201220132014Three-Year TotalSalary $743,546 $791,982 $863,500 $2,399,028Bonus $600,000 00 $600,000Restricted stock awards $4,424,000 $9,356,250 $5,149,500 $18,929,750Non-equity incentive plan compensation $1,140,000 $724,500 $602,140 $2,466,640All other compensation $32,984 $25,751 $25,535 $84,270Total $6,940,530 $10,898,483 $6,640,675 $24,479,688DATA SOURCE: SEC FILING.A major differenceJoshi is heavily incentivized to drive 3D Systems' stock significantly higher during his tenure, whereas Reichental was awarded restricted stock that vested over a predetermined timetable, regardless of company performance.FORMER 3D SYSTEMS CEO AVI REICHENTAL. IMAGE SOURCE: 3D SYSTEMS.Theoretically, incentivizing Joshi around 3D Systems' future stock price improves the company's earnings while attempting to protect the board from rewarding poor performance. Previously, Reichental's incentive package didn't protect the company from his hyper-aggressive acquisition strategy that ultimately left the company with numerous operational challenges, inefficiencies, and a sunken stock price.The $23.3 million questionAlthough Joshi's compensation package shows that 3D Systems' board wants to better align how it compensates executives with the interest of shareholders, the plan could backfire. An 2014 academic study found evidence that highly compensated CEOs translated to poor future stock returns and financial performance over the following three years. The study suggested that being too compensated as a leader can breed a false sense of confidence and lead to making bad financial and business decisions.Additionally, when executives are incentivized to drive their company's stock price higher, they can be tempted to chase short-term performance at the expense of the long-term best interest of the business. For instance, if 3D Systems aggressively cut costs to boost earnings next quarter, but it led to product reliability issues, the company could face reputational damage that could hurt its long-term prospects.Ultimately, Joshi's 32-year tenure at HP suggests that he's willing to play the long game, and it's likely why the board took a calculated risk that he isn't in it for the short term. Whether or not that was the right call depends on his approach to 3D Systems' business and market opportunity, which is largely unknown at this point. Fortunately, 3D Systems investors may not have to wait long for the answer, as the company is reporting its first-quarter earnings on May 5 before the market opens.10 stocks we like better than 3D SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Is It Time To Buy FireEye, Inc?","Jan 26, 2016 at 11:01AM","Shares of cybersecurity firm FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) have been cut in half over the past year. That decline, which pushed the stock below its IPO price, was mainly caused by concerns about its financial discipline, executive turnover, and rising competition. However, FireEye stock recently rebounded on two positive developments.SOURCE: PIXABAY.First, it pre-announced fourth quarter sales of $184 million to $185 million, which matches its prior guidance for $182 million to $190 million. Billings are expected to be between $256 million to $257 million, reaching the high end of its prior guidance of $240 million to $260 million. Second, FireEye acquired threat-intelligence service iSight for $200 million in cash. If iSight reaches an unspecified bookings target before the end of FireEye's second quarter of 2018, FireEye will pay the firm up to $75 million more in cash and stock. FireEye expects the deal to be ""slightly accretive"" to its operating income and cash flow in 2016.Those announcements helped FireEye climb back from its all-time low of around $13, but how long will the rally last? Let's dig deeper into FireEye's strengths and weaknesses to decide.Why FireEye mattersUnlike many cybersecurity firms, which only identify or isolate attacks after they hit, FireEye offers threat prevention solutions. FireEye was the first cybersecurity firm to be certified by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and was called in to investigate major data breaches at U.S. companies over the past few years.That ""best in breed"" reputation helped FireEye secure a security services partnership with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, a threat-intelligence sharing deal with Check Point Software, and an integration deal with F5 Networks' application delivery controllers. It also helped Visa create Visa Threat Intelligence, a subscription-based service which providers real-time data on threats to card issuers and merchants.Reasons to buy FireEyeAccording to the Identity Theft Resource Center, a total of 169 million personal records were exposed last year in data breaches, up from 85.6 million in 2014. As a result, demand for cybersecurity services will likely surge over the next few years. Research firm Markets and Markets expects the global cybersecurity market to grow from $106.3 billion in 2015 to $170.2 billion in 2020.FIREEYE'S CYBER THREAT MAP. SOURCE: FIREEYE.FireEye's growth reflects that demand. In fiscal 2014, its revenue soared 163% annually to $425.7 million. Looking ahead, analysts expect its revenue to rise 47% in fiscal 2015 and another 30.5% in fiscal 2016. While that growth is slowing down, its business doesn't look like it will peak anytime soon, and analyst forecasts haven't been adjusted for iSight's upcoming contributions to FireEye's top line. FireEye's total deferred revenue also rose 61% annually to $454.9 million last quarter, indicating that demand for its services remains strong.With a P/S ratio of 4.1, FireEye stock remains fundamentally cheaper than cybersecurity peers Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and CyberArk, which respectively trade at 12 and 10 times trailing sales.Reasons to avoid FireEyeFireEye's biggest weakness is its lack of a defensive moat against bigger rivals like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Palo Alto. Cisco, which acquired cybersecurity firms like SourceFire and ThreatGrid, has been adding similar threat prevention services to its security portfolio. Cisco often bundles these security products with its own networking hardware, which can prevent smaller challengers like FireEye from gaining ground among enterprise customers. Palo Alto, which develops an industry-standard firewall for businesses, also acquired cybersecurity firm Cyvera in 2014 to expand its threat-detection abilities.To counter these threats, FireEye will need to boost its R&D and marketing expenses. Unfortunately, FireEye remains unprofitable and burns through cash quickly. During the third quarter, its GAAP net loss widened from $120 million a year earlier to $135.5 million due to higher operating expenses and stock-based compensation. For 2015, it expects its operating margin to remain between negative 38% and 39%.FireEye's cash and equivalents rose from $146.4 million last year to $463.9 million, but only because it did a convertible debt offering to raise $800 million last May. CFO Michael Sheridan, who had been with FireEye since 2011, also abruptly resigned last July, casting doubts on the company's financial discipline. FireEye's insiders also don't seem confident in the company's future -- over the past 12 months, insiders only bought 725,000 shares, but sold 2.6 million shares.The verdict: FireEye remains a high-risk playFireEye sells essential security services for an increasingly connected world, but its stock has too many problems to ignore. Sales growth, while robust, is slowing down. FireEye's net losses are widening, and it will likely need to keep burning through cash to keep up with its better-funded rivals.In a volatile market, FireEye shares could decline further due to its lack of earnings-based support. I'm not saying that investors should avoid FireEye, but they should approach this stock carefully and fully understand its risks.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Golden Parachute: 5 Shocking Examples of Shareholder Rip-Offs,"Jan 3, 2016 at 7:29AM","PHOTO: U.S. ARMY, VIA FLICKRThere are many troubling things that go on in corporate executive suites that most shareholders know nothing about. A perfect example is the golden parachute that many boards of directors agree to give CEOs. It's worth learning more about golden parachutes, at least so that you can think twice before investing in companies that feature egregious ones.Defining termsSo what, exactly, is a golden parachute? It's part of an executive's compensation package and is an agreement that he or she will receive a specified sum if or when they lose their job -- whether by being fired, by a management change related to a merger or an acquisition, or some other reason.The agreed-upon sum is typically shockingly generous, which is why it's deemed ""golden."" It's troubling because it's shareholder money going to a departing executive who will no longer be serving the company. And in many cases, it's going to a CEO who has been terminated because of unsatisfactory performance -- and who is nevertheless being rewarded with riches.Is there any rationale for them? Well, yes. Proponents will argue that a golden parachute can help attract talented CEOs and that it might prevent a takeover due to the unpleasant cost of ejecting the sitting CEO.Bad examplesReviewing some examples of golden parachutes will give you a much clearer understanding of what they are. Here are just a few noteworthy ones:Meg Whitman, CEO of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), stands to receive almost  $91 million if there's a change of control at the company, and more than $51 million if she's terminated.Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) and Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP) are looking to merge, and if they do, the CEO of Office Depot may collect $39 million in accelerated vesting of stock awards. (The FTC has objected to the merger, but Staples is objecting to its reasoning.)Dell is buying storage giant EMC (NYSE:EMC) and EMC's CEO is collecting a severance package worth $27 million, including some accelerated vesting of stock awards.Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) co-founder James Moffett is stepping down from the company, which has seen its shares plunge about 70%over the past yet, and according to Bloomberg, ""Life after Freeport-McMoRan will have its benefits for outgoing chairman James 'Jim Bob' Moffett: namely, a payout that could reach $83.3 million plus $1.5 million in annual consulting fees.""Back in 1995, Michael Ovitz was hired by Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), only to leave with a severance package worth $140 million after just 14 months on the job.There are good examples, too. According to a UBS report, for instance, the CEOs of Apple and Akamai Technologies stand to receive $0 if they're terminated, while CEOs at IBM and Accenture plc will get bupkis if there's a change in their control of the company.Ch-ch-ch-changesFor those disgusted or alarmed by golden parachutes, there's cause for hopeful optimism. Public awareness of and displeasure with them has been rising, and attempts are being made -- with some success -- to rein them in.Earlier this year, for example, the Council of Institutional Investors (CII) approved a policy opposing ending automatic accelerated vesting of unearned stock awards, suggesting that boards be able to permit full, partial or no accelerated vesting.Meanwhile, golden parachutes don't appear to be growing significantly, as they have in the past. A study by the Alvarez & Marsal firm found, ""The average total value of change in control benefits for the top 200 CEOs remained relatively flat at $29,853,057 in 2013 compared to $30,263,141 in 2011. More telling, far fewer companies are now ""grossing up"" payments by paying the departing CEO for the taxes he or she will owe on the severance package. While 61% of CEOs in 2009 stood to benefit from gross-ups, only 30% did in 2013.What to doArmed with a better understanding of golden parachutes, what should we individual investors do? Well, we might think twice about investing in companies that offer their CEOs hefty severance packages. Such arrangements often waste shareholder dollars, and they certainly don't motivate CEOs to stick around and position the company for long-term success.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Cisco Systems Inc. or Juniper Networks Inc?,"Mar 17, 2016 at 4:20PM","Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) are two of the four biggest networking equipment companies in the world. IDC reports that market leader Cisco controlled 59.2% of the global Ethernet switching market in the fourth quarter of 2015. Juniper, which ranks fourth in that market after Huawei and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, controlled just 3.8%.IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.However, Juniper's Ethernet switching revenue rose 16.7% in 2015, while Cisco's only inched up 1%. Juniper's market share is also growing as Cisco's is gradually declining. So, which networking equipment stock is a better buy today -- the market leader or the growing underdog?Top-line comparisonsCisco's revenue slipped 0.1% annually to $11.93 billion last quarter, which still beat estimates by $170 million. Excluding the set-top box business it sold to Technicolor, for both quarters, revenue rose 2% to $11.83 billion. Cisco's brightest spot of growth was its service provider video business, which posted 37% sales growth thanks to soaring demand in China. Security sales grew 11%, collaboration sales grew 3%, and its routing sales improved 5%. Those four units generated a third of Cisco's revenue during the quarter. Deferred revenue rose 8% to $15.2 billion thanks to growing demand for its software and subscription offerings.However, revenue at its data center and switching businesses, which together accounted for 36% of Cisco's sales, respectively fell 3% and 4%. Soft demand in the U.S. and the EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, Africa) also wasn't completely offset by double-digit growth across the Asia Pacific region. For the current quarter, Cisco expects to post 1% to 4% annual sales growth -- which easily beats consensus estimates for a 1% decline.Juniper's revenue rose 20% annually to $1.32 billion last quarter, beating estimates by $20 million. Revenue at the routing and switching businesses, which accounted for 65% of its sales, respectively rose 24% and 21% annually. Security solutions revenue rose 20% and accounted for 9% of Juniper's top line, while other services revenue rose 12%. Unlike Cisco, Juniper posted double-digit sales growth in the Americas and Asia, which was only slightly hurt by a 2% decline in EMEA revenue. However, Juniper's guidance for 9.7% sales growth in the current quarter missed more bullish expectations for 11.5% growth because of macro concerns.IMAGE SOURCE: CISCO.Bottom-line comparisonsLast quarter, Cisco's non-GAAP net income rose 8% annually to $2.9 billion, or $0.57 per share -- beating expectations by $0.03. On a GAAP basis, net income rose 31% to $3.1 billion. Juniper's non-GAAP net income rose 38% annually to $248 million last quarter. That translated to earnings of $0.63 per share, which also beat estimates by $0.04. On a GAAP basis, Juniper generated net income of $634 million, compared to a loss of $334 million a year earlier.Cisco expects to post flat to 4% non-GAAP earnings growth for the current quarter, which is in line with analyst estimates. Juniper expects non-GAAP earnings to rise 31% to 44% for the current quarter, but analysts had expected 47% growth.Looking further ahead, analysts expect Cisco and Juniper to respectively post 8% and 12% annual earnings growth over the next five years. Based on those forecasts, Cisco currently has a 5-year PEG ratio of 1.5, while Juniper has a PEG ratio of 1. This means Juniper is ""cheaper"" than Cisco based on its earnings growth potential, but it still can't be considered ""undervalued"" since the PEG ratio hasn't dropped below the 1.0 mark.Dividends and buybacksWhile Juniper is fundamentally cheaper, Cisco's forward annual dividend yield of 3.7% is more than double Juniper's 1.5% yield. Cisco has raised its dividend for five consecutive years, while Juniper hasn't hiked its dividend since introducing one in 2014.Over the past 12 months, Cisco has paid out 34% of its free cash flow as dividends, and another 23% on buybacks, which lifted its EPS. Last quarter, Cisco committed another $15 billion to its buyback program, bringing the total allocation to $16.9 billion -- enough to buy back about 12% of its outstanding shares at current levels.During the same period, Juniper paid out 22% of its free cash flow as dividends and another 151% on buybacks, which were mainly fueled by debt. Juniper didn't authorize any new buybacks, but it noted it had returned $3.6 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends since the first quarter of 2014, and it plans for that figure to reach $4.1 billion by the end of this year.SOURCE: YCHARTS.The verdictChoosing between Cisco and Juniper is tough. Cisco has a higher dividend, a more diversified business model, and a more aggressive inorganic growth strategy, but Juniper is growing in markets where Cisco isn't, and its double-digit growth and low PEG ratio make it look like a cheap growth stock. For now, I think Cisco is a better buy because it's a more stable, income-generating play in a volatile market, but I'll keep an eye on Juniper to see if it becomes cheap enough to be considered a value play."
"Instant Analysis: Xerox to Split in Two, Announces Results","Jan 29, 2016 at 9:17PM","What happened?Document technology-stalwart Xerox (NYSE:XRX) has decided to multiply. The company announced that it will divide itself into two publicly traded entities. The first will concentrate on its legacy document-technology business, while the other will specialize in business services such as outsourcing. The former will be the larger of the two by revenue, as its 2015 top line was roughly $11 billion; the latter's came in around $7 billion.Xerox has not yet determined what the names of the two companies will be, or who will serve as their chief executives. One certainty is that Xerox's second-largest shareholder, Carl Icahn, will be given three board seats on the smaller company's nine-member board.The move is the culmination of a strategic review of its business that Xerox's management began last October. The company expects the split to be completed by the end of this year.Separately, Xerox announced its Q4 and fiscal 2015 results. For the quarter, net income rose nearly 43% on a year-over-year basis, to $285 million, or $0.32 on a per-share, adjusted basis. Revenue, however, dropped by 8%, to $4.65 billion. Analysts had been projecting EPS of $0.28 on a top line of $4.73 billion.On an annual basis, revenue was 8% lower than 2014's result, at just more than $18 million, while the bottom line saw a much steeper fall of 52%, to $488 million.Lastly, Xerox raised its quarterly dividend to nearly $0.08 per share, 11% higher than its predecessor. This will be dispensed on April 29 to shareholders of record as of March 31.Does it matter?Those two business lines, essentially hardware and outsourcing services, never really gelled together. Xerox's annual results tell the tale: Revenue has dropped every year since 2011, with net income generally following suit.Xerox's position is very reminiscent of the company now known as HP, which also split into two companies along product/service lines. Like Xerox, HP's predecessor struggled with revenue and profit erosion, and management concluded it was best to separate in order to unlock value. This happened late last year, so it's too soon to tell whether this is a boon to either resulting entity, HP and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.Regardless, this move fundamentally changes the investing thesis for Xerox given that it will turn into a pair of separate companies. I think, like HP/Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, that Xerox has a sluggish business at its heart that won't necessarily be improved by the split. Of course, much will depend on leadership and strategic decisions, so investors should keep a watchful eye on how both develop.10 stocks we like better than XeroxWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The 3 Most Important Numbers for Cisco Systems Inc.,"Jan 13, 2016 at 1:14PM","Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), the dominant player in the networking hardware industry, may not seem like an exciting company. But going forward, Cisco has multiple major growth opportunities that could propel the company's growth beyond the slow, steady expansion of its core switching and routing businesses. Here are three numbers that will be extremely important to Cisco over the next few years.SOURCE: CISCO.50 billionWhile many of the ""smart"" products that have launched in recent years may not be very useful (who needs an Internet-connected coffee maker?), the Internet of Things is a big deal. For businesses, greater efficiencies, driven by a vast network of Internet connected sensors and devices, could be game changing for many industries, and the companies that don't adapt could be left behind.Cisco estimates that 50 billion devices will be connected to the Internet by 2020, up from 15 billion during the middle of 2015. It's not difficult to imagine this number going much higher in the long run, and the amount of data generated by these devices will be truly staggering. As the leading provider of networking hardware such as switches and routers, Cisco will play an integral role as the Internet continues to evolve.The company has been shifting toward being a seller of integrated solutions, as opposed to simply selling hardware, a move that will allow the company to help solve the increasingly difficult networking problems brought on by both the Internet of Things and the cloud. In 2015, Cisco estimates that it generated $9 billion of revenue from software, and the company expects this number to grow by 10%-15% annually over the next few years. Meanwhile, services brought in $11 billion in revenue, and Cisco expects this number to grow by 4%-7% annually going forward.With tens of billions of devices set to generate untold quantities of data, Cisco is positioning itself to be a key enabler of the Internet of Things.6.6%Cisco's core business is networking hardware, but the company has also made a name for itself in the server market. Cisco's UCS line of servers has been winning market share since launching in 2009, and the company managed to capture 6.6% of the global server market during the third quarter of 2015. While more established server vendors have been hurt by the major cloud computing companies designing their own systems, Cisco's server business has been growing at an impressive pace.During Cisco's fiscal first quarter, the company's data center segment, which is comprised primarily of UCS servers, generated $859 million of revenue, up 24% year over year. While the data center segment accounts for just 6.8% of Cisco total revenue, it's by far fastest growing segment, helping to drive growth beyond the slow and steady pace of Cisco's core business.It's difficult to say how large of a market share Cisco can ultimately achieve in the server market, but the company doesn't appear to be slowing down. At its current pace of growth, Cisco could become the third largest server vendor in the world in just a few years, behind only Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Dell.54Another major growth business for Cisco is security. Cisco has made quite a few security acquisitions over the past few years, including Lancope, Portcullis, OpenDNS, Neohapsis, ThreatGRID, and Sourcefire, and while the security business is currently growing slowly, with sales increasing by just 7% year-over-year during Cisco's latest quarter, the company expects growth to accelerate to a mid-to-high-teens percentage in the second half of 2016.More acquisitions are likely, especially given the fragmentation of the security market. Cisco estimates that the average large enterprise has 54 different security vendors, each handling specialized functions. Consolidation is inevitable, and Cisco is positioning itself to emerge as a diversified security vendor that can handle the bulk of a client's needs.One name that has come up as a possible acquisition target is FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE). Until recently, FireEye's stock traded at extremely elevated levels, making an acquisition unlikely. However, thanks to a recent slump in FireEye's stock price, the company may now make sense as a Cisco acquisition target. FireEye is chronically unprofitable as it follows a growth-at-all-costs strategy, but adding FireEye to Cisco's stable of security companies could give the networking giant's security segment a much needed boost.Regardless of which companies Cisco chooses to acquire, with so many different security vendors scrambling for market share, consolidation in the industry is almost guaranteed."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.: What You Need to Know,"Sep 9, 2016 at 5:07PM","Based on its 3% stock-price decline following what was a sound, if not spectacular, 2016 third-quarter earnings announcement on Sept. 7, investors were less than impressed with Hewlett Packard Enterprise's (NYSE:HPE) results. It's also likely CEO Meg Whitman's announcement of yet another major shift in HP Enterprise's business transformation played a role in the Street's somewhat muted reaction.While it's clear a number of analysts and investors aren't enamored with the changes Whitman is implementing, they will prove to be the driving force behind the future of HP Enterprise. And that translates to an opportunity for patient investors willing and able to give HP Enterprise the time it needs to make the transition, particularly in a few key areas highlighted in the recent quarter.IMAGE SOURCE: HP ENTERPRISE.It's all about focusInvestors may recall one of the objectives of the split with the company now called HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), back in Nov. of 2015, was to run a focused, more adaptable company to prosper in the rapidly changing world of technology. To facilitate HP Enterprise's plans to shed non-core assets, it announced an $8.5 billion deal to spin off and then merge its Enterprise Services unit with Computer Sciences Corp. (NYSE:CSC).HP Enterprise shareholders will gain a 50% ownership stake in the ""new"" CSC when the deal closes. As it happens, HP Enterprise has another non-core unit that has also been under pressure to maintain revenue, let alone increase it: software. Whitman confirmed the rumors that had been swirling the last couple of weeks, announcing another spin-off and merger, this time with U.K.-based Micro Focus International (NASDAQOTH:MCFUF).In addition to receiving a $2.5 billion cash payment for the $8.8 billion merger of certain ""non-core software assets"" with Micro Focus, HP Enterprise shareholders will own 50.1% of one of world's ""largest pure play software companies."" Just as importantly for HP Enterprise, the move will sharpen its aim of leading the hybrid cloud, data center Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), and Internet of Things (IoT) revolutions.Lean and meanAnother objective of the split with HP was to gain cost efficiencies -- and it's already working like a charm. Analysts had expected HP Enterprise to report $0.45 non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share in Q3 on $12.64 billion in sales. HP Enterprise pleasantly surprised by reporting $0.49 per share -- a 9% improvement year over year -- on revenue of just $12.2 billion.The reason HP Enterprise was able to report a jump in EPS, despite its 6% drop in sales compared to last year, can be summed up by its impressive $3.1 billion decline in total costs and expenses in Q3. The result: Earnings from operations jumped tenfold to $2.5 billion, despite an $800 million decline in revenue.And cost efficiencies will improve even further with the completion of the aforementioned spin-off mergers. The CSC deal alone is expected to generate synergies that will pare costs $1 billion in the first year, and as much as $1.5 billion annually going forward.Just the factsWith so many costs associated with restructuring following the HP split still on the books, HP Enterprise's non-GAAP results are a more accurate measure -- and will be for the current quarter as well, given that the company's ""independence"" began in Nov. of 2015. After considering ""divestitures and currency,"" HP Enterprise's segment revenue wasn't quite as poor as it appeared.The Enterprise Group has been and will continue to be the driving force behind HP Enterprise's growth. The key unit's sales of $6.5 billion were flat on a non-GAAP basis compared to a year ago. Not bad, considering server and storage revenue each declined by 2% and 5%, respectively. But a 12% jump in the division's networking business and 1% improvement from tech services made up for its other shortcomings.Change is in the cards at HP Enterprise, and that can be worrisome for investors -- or an opportunity. That said, Whitman summed up her strategic moves perfectly in a recent interview, saying HP Enterprise will succeed because ""the next five years is going to belong to the nimble, the fast, and the focused.""

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. Stock: One of the Cheapest in Tech,"Sep 16, 2016 at 11:18AM","When the split with HP (NYSE:HPQ) was finalized in November last year, the primary objectives of the new HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) and its former partner were to pare overhead and become more adaptable to the ever-changing tech industry. Less than a year into the parting of ways with HP, CEO Meg Whitman has HP Enterprise heading in the right direction, and more changes are afoot.For some investors and industry pundits, change can be worrisome. With change often comes uncertainty, and that translates to some folks waiting to see how things unfold. That appears to be the case with HP Enterprise, given its consensus price target of just $24 a share and what amounts to a hold recommendation. This makes HP Enterprise one of the cheapest stocks in tech.IMAGE SOURCE: HP ENTERPRISE.Changes afootOne of the first significant moves Whitman made after HP Enterprise became a stand-alone tech services provider was inking a deal with Computer Sciences Corp. (NYSE:CSC) to spin off and then merge its struggling enterprise services group creating a ""new $26 billion pure play in global IT services.""Not only does the spinoff merger with CSC rid HP Enterprise of a money-losing unit, but even after accounting for divestiture costs and currency, the move will boost its overall margins, too. The enterprise services unit's 8.3% operating margin is by far the lowest of any HP Enterprise unit. By comparison, the enterprise group and software margins were 12.6% and 17.8%, respectively.The deal with CSC will also create an estimated $1 billion in savings in year one, and climb to $1.5 billion annually going forward. The combined global tech services leader will instantly become a global powerhouse, and there's the not-so-small matter of HP Enterprise shareholders owning approximately 50% of the new combined entity.HP Enterprise expects the deal will deliver $8.5 billion in after-tax value to its shareholders, which will include approximately a $4.5 billion stake in the ""new"" company, a $1.5 billion dividend payout, and shaving $2.5 billion of debt off the HP Enterprise books.Once is good, twice is betterThe CSC arrangement will unlock a great deal of value for shareholders when it closes around March next year, both in a new stock and an even leaner HP Enterprise. And just a week ago HP Enterprise announced a similar spinoff-and-merger deal for its software unit with U.K.-based Micro Focus (NASDAQOTH:MCFUF).Unlike the CSC arrangement, HP Enterprise said it will spin off only its ""non-core"" software assets in the Micro Focus transaction, which is valued at $8.8 billion. HP Enterprise shareholders won't be left holding the software bag, by any means. In fact, following the closing of the deal, which is expected in March next year, HP Enterprise shareholders will own 50.1% of Micro Focus -- a stake valued at an estimated $6.3 billion. HP Enterprise will also receive a $2.5 billion cash payment upon closing.Once the smoke clearsAlready HP Enterprise runs its business more efficiently than before the split with HP. Even adding back in a $2.17 billion gain for the divestiture of H3C in fiscal Q3 2016, HP Enterprise shaved about $1 billion in overhead compared to the year-ago period. And the cost savings will continue climbing when the reinvented HP Enterprise finally comes to fruition.What's left for shareholders after HP Enterprise's spinoffs? A $28 billion business with a laserlike focus on cloud, the Internet of Things, software-defined servers, networking, and data storage markets. Oh, and a 50% stake in one of the world's largest tech service providers, and 50.1% ownership of a global Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) leader. After all, IaaS is a market expected to grow over 38% this year, and that's just in the cloud.All of that and HP Enterprise is trading at a mere eight times trailing earnings? For all those reasons, HP Enterprise belongs near the top of any list of cheap tech stocks. 10 stocks we like better than Hewlett Packard EnterpriseWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co Stock Hits New High, And Its Still A Bargain","Sep 24, 2016 at 11:23AM","Though its stock price has backed off a bit since hitting a new 52-week high of $23.53 a share Thursday, HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) owners are still enjoying a more than 50% jump in value this year. That kind of appreciation can set off alarms among those who ""missed the boat."" But in HP Enterprise's case, there's still time to climb aboard and enjoy the ride, despite what some pundits say.HP Enterprise's consensus price target is $23.02 a share -- below its current level -- with what amounts to a ""hold"" rating. It's not hard to see why it has received such a blasé outlook from the Street, given HP Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman's game-changing moves in recent months. Big changes can lead to uncertainty, and that often translates to a ""wait-and-see"" mentality in the market. But for investors in search of long-term growth and tremendous value, HP Enterprise is still worth a good, hard look.IMAGE SOURCE: HP ENTERPRISE.Change is goodThe objective of last year's split with what is now called HP Inc. was to unlock value, shave overhead, and allow HP Enterprise to become a more nimble, focused player in its core competencies, such as infrastructure and software products and services. So far, so good based on several key metrics from HP Enterprise's fiscal 2016 Q3 earnings report.HP Enterprise cut a whopping $5.1 billion in total expenses in Q3 compared to a year ago, led by a nearly $700 million paring of sales-related costs. The leaner, meaner HP Enterprise was able to increase non-GAAP (excluding one-time items) operating margins to 8.8%, up from last year's 8.5%. The result was a 9% jump in earnings per share after accounting for the split with HP. Not bad considering total sales declined 6% to $12.2 billion.The more recent changes began in May, when HP Enterprise announced a spin-off/merger of its enterprise services unit to Computers Sciences Corp (NYSE:CSC). According to Whitman, the move will allow HP Enterprise to ""further sharpen its leadership in building the vital end-to-end infrastructure solutions necessary to power the enterprise cloud and mobility revolutions.""Shareholders of HP Enterprise can expect an estimated $8.5 billion in after-tax value from the deal, which includes a 50% equity stake in CSC equal to $4.5 billion, a $1.5 billion dividend payout, and assuming about $2.5 billion in debt. The CSC arrangement also rids HP Enterprise of its lowest margin business.Let's do that againHP Enterprise's worst-performing unit, as measured by year-over-year declines, was handily its software division. Though it accounted for just 6% of HP Enterprise's $12.2 billion in revenue last quarter, the unit's $738 million in sales nosedived 18%. That, too, will soon be remedied thanks to HP Enterprise's decision to spin-off and merge its ""non-core software assets"" with U.K.-based Micro Focus (NASDAQOTH:MCFUF).The Micro Focus deal is valued at $8.8 billion, which includes a $2.5 billion payment to HP Enterprise, and it will retain a 50.1% ownership position in what will be ""one of the world's largest pure-play enterprise software companies."" As per Whitman, the spin-off/merger of its enterprise services division with Micro Focus will create ""a faster-growing, higher-margin, stronger cash flow company.""When it's all said and done HP Enterprise investors will have an ownership stake in three industry leaders that offer a host of complementary offerings. Just imagine the product and service synergies and joint sales opportunities that will arise when the deals close by the end of Q1 2017. The possibilities are endless and will benefit all parties involved, particularly HP Enterprise shareholders.From a value perspective, HP Enterprise stock, even near its 52-week high, still trades at just 9 times trailing earnings: That's about half the P/E ratio of most of its peers. Whitman has HP Enterprise poised to succeed where it counts -- in high margin, fast-growing markets. Add to that its relative value, and HP Enterprise stock is still a bargain.10 stocks we like better than Hewlett Packard EnterpriseWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co Stock Could Climb Higher,"Aug 25, 2016 at 8:07AM","So far, so good for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) shareholders following the split with HP (NYSE:HPQ). The new HP Enterprise stock has skyrocketed 44% year to date. Though CEO Dion Weisler's HP hasn't quite matched HP Enterprise, it's hard to complain about 23% appreciation so far in 2016.As for HP Enterprise, investors might look at its stellar performance so far in 2016 and wonder if it's too late to jump on board. That's a legitimate question, and one that analysts -- based on consensus price target estimates of $21.26, which is about where its stock price is right now -- would suggest that the HP Enterprise train has already left the station.But don't be too quick to dismiss HP Enterprise. CEO Meg Whitman and team are in the right markets at the right time, even with its meteoric stock price jump it's still undervalued, and there are changes on the horizon that will be a boon for shareholders.IMAGE SOURCE: HP ENTERPRISE.Still on salePrior to the split with HP, the combined company's stock had taken a merciless drumming -- and rightfully so. It was almost as if the now-two businesses were tripping over each other, and Hewlett-Packard shareholders were paying the price.As it relates to HP Enterprise stock's value, the fact it had been under so much pressure helps explain why even currently it's still trading at a mere 17 times trailing earnings. And the current valuation as measured by HP Enterprise's trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) isn't even the best part. Based on expectations for the coming year, HP Enterprise stock is trading at just 10.75 times forward earnings.HP Enterprise's relative value paints a nice picture for investors, but better still is how Whitman and team were able to improve earnings-per-share (EPS) by a whopping 12% last quarter with a ""mere"" 1% increase in total revenue: the first year-over-year revenue improvement in five years. Even with the sales improvement, HP Enterprise expenses were essentially flat. Rising sales without increasing overhead? That's a nice combination.Right place, right timeIn many respects HP Enterprise's emphasis on providing cloud, mobile, and Internet of Things (IoT) related technology solutions, ""software-defined infrastructure,"" and networking platforms as opposed to HP's hardware-focus has made life for Whitman and team a bit easier. To its credit, HP's transition to virtual reality-ready (VR) PCs and ultra-thin detachable tablets is not only keeping its head above water, it's thriving.The bottom line is that the market for HP Enterprise's solutions is poised to explode in the coming years. Thanks in large part to the onset of a digitized world, the amount of data -- and the need for companies from virtually all industries to transfer and utilize all that information in the cloud -- has created a huge opportunity for HP Enterprise.According to research firm IDC, in 2015 about 1% of apps utilized cognitive services. That is expected to rise to 50% in just two years. And by 2017, two-thirds of the CEO's of the world's largest companies will have ""digital transformation"" as a centerpiece of their company's corporate strategy. That kind of widespread transformation won't be managed by IT departments alone.One of each, pleaseHP Enterprise is close to expanding its suite of service solutions to serve the aforementioned companies making the transition to a digital world. HP Enterprise's tax-free spin-off and subsequent merger with Computer Sciences Corp (NYSE:CSC) is expected to be finalized early next year.Combined, HP Enterprise expects the new, as yet unnamed entity, will generate $26 billion in revenue annually, improve margins, save $1 billion in expenses, and increase free cash flow. HP Enterprise shareholders will own 50% of the new strategic consulting services firm, which translates to an estimated $8.5 billion value.In addition to the obvious benefits to shareholders, the spin-off and merger with CSC is yet another example of HP Enterprise's efforts to maximize efficiencies in the ever-changing tech industry. HP Enterprise has had a stellar run, but that shouldn't scare off investors: It still offers great value and it's positioned to take full advantage of fast-growing markets. In other words, the best is still to come."
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co Stock Is Up 56% in 2016, Is It Time to Sell?","Dec 29, 2016 at 8:08AM","Last year's split with HP (NYSE:HPQ) has been a boon for shareholders of HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE). With its stock soaring 56% year to date, short-term investors may think it's time to capture some gains, and for those who opted to stay on the sidelines, it may seem as though it's too late to jump onboard the HP Enterprise train.But don't be too quick to discard HP Enterprise, despite its strong performance in 2016. With some big changes on the horizon and its relatively inexpensive valuation even after its stellar run, HP Enterprise still warrants a long, hard look for long-term investors in search of growth.IMAGE SOURCE: HP ENTERPRISE.Three is better than oneCEO Meg Whitman's pledge to become a more agile tech powerhouse in fast-growing markets including cloud infrastructure, software as a service (SaaS), the Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics took a major step forward in May of this year with news that HP Enterprise would spin off, then merge, its Enterprise Services group with software giant Computer Sciences Corp (NYSE:CSC).In addition to an expected bump in both operating margin and free cash flow, the deal with CSC includes a $1.5 billion one-time cash dividend for existing HP Enterprise shareholders, and an estimated 50% stake in the new company. In fact, the agreement with CSC made so much sense, Whitman decided to do it again.In an effort to boost margins and cash flow even further, HP Enterprise recently announced it would spin off its ""non-core software assets"" with U.K.-based Micro Focus (NASDAQOTH:MCFUF), creating ""one of the world's largest pure-play enterprise software companies."" And HP Enterprise shareholders will gain a 50% share of yet another global tech powerhouse.Fundamentals matterIn addition to improving margins and cash flow, along with investors owning parts of three IT powerhouses following the mergers with CSC and Micro Focus, HP Enterprise's already rock-solid balance sheet will benefit. The merger with Micro Focus also includes a $2.5 billion cash payment to HP Enterprise, which will open the door to a world of opportunities.HP Enterprise ended its 2016 fiscal year with just shy of $13 billion in cash and equivalents, up from $9.8 billion a year ago. The boost in ready cash was largely due to Whitman's strict management of expenses, as evidenced by HP Enterprise shaving approximately $2.2 billion in costs last year, and that's after factoring in one-time gains for divestitures.When the Micro Focus merger closes in late March, assuming all of the necessary conditions are met, HP Enterprise will add another $2.5 billion to its balance sheet. Perhaps another dividend boost will be in the cards, or likelier still would be more niche acquisitions like HP Enterprise's recently completed $275 million deal for big data analytics provider SGI. With a balance sheet like HP Enterprise, who knows? Another dividend hike and more targeted, solution-specific acquisitions could be in the offing.What's not to likeIt may seem like a head-scratcher given HP Enterprise's performance in 2016, but it remains one of the cheapest stocks in its sector, trading at a mere 13 times trailing earnings. And HP Enterprise is valued at a paltry 11.5 times future earnings. Analysts' general blase attitude toward HE Enterprise may have something to do with its valuation.With a consensus price target of $25 a share -- all of 5% above current levels -- and what amounts to a ""hold"" rating, pundits clearly aren't enamored with HP Enterprise. But analyst negativity or its stellar stock price run in 2016 shouldn't dissuade long-term investors from giving HP Enterprise stock a serious look.And considering HP Enterprise stock will soon include ownership in three tech leaders, rock-solid fundamentals, and the fact it's a screaming value relative to its peers, existing owners should maintain their positions, if not add to them.10 stocks we like better than Hewlett Packard EnterpriseWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

4 Reasons to Buy Hewlett Packard Enterprise Stock Now,"Nov 14, 2016 at 5:15PM","Here's a clear sign that HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) isn't impressing the analysts: It has a consensus target price of $23.25 a share, and it's already trading above that level. This would seem to indicate that -- in the pundits' view -- growth investors who didn't get in early enough to enjoy HP Enterprise's stellar 50%-plus gains so far this year have missed the boat.However, though the analysts keeping tabs on HP Enterprise are, as a group, somewhat muted in their expectations,  other investors are buying significant stakes in the hybrid cloud infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) leader, and it's even won over a select few ""experts"" recently. And it's about time.For several reasons, CEO Meg Whitman's plans for HP Enterprise are becoming clearer by the day, and those plans have the company positioned for years of growth in some of the fastest-growing markets in tech.IMAGE SOURCE: HP ENTERPRISE.Fundamentals still matterIn a time when many investors don't seem concerned about companies losing money hand over fist in pursuit of top-line growth, HP Enterprise is a welcome exception for those who actually appreciate strengths such as a solid balance sheet and other financial fundamentals. In that regard, not only is the company in the envious position of sitting on mountains of ready  cash, it's getting stronger by the day.Last quarter was a harbinger of what investors can expect going forward. Strong operating cash flow and expense management helped boost HP Enterprise's cash and equivalents by $900 million last quarter compared to a year ago, to a whopping $10.74 billion. HP Enterprise's stellar balance sheet opens the door to a number of possibilities going forward, including its recently announced dividend boost, share buyback initiative, and SGI acquisition.Three stocks are better than oneThe strength of HP Enterprise's balance sheet will soon get a boost from its spinoff/merger deal with U.K.-based Micro Focus  (NASDAQOTH:MCFUF), though which it will shed a large chunk of its ""non-core software assets."" Why? Because a part of the deal, Micro Focus will be writing HPE a $2.5 billion check: but that's just one of the benefits  to shareholders.Similar to the $8.5 billion spinoff/merger of its enterprise division with Computer Sciences Corp. (NYSE:CSC), which is expected to close in March, the $8.8 billion arrangement with Micro Focus will give shareholders an approximately 50% ownership stake in the ""new"" company. So not only will HPE shareholders be getting three stocks for the price of one, they will also enjoy instant diversification across IT services, including a stake in ""one of the world's largest pure-play enterprise software companies,"" a ""global IT services powerhouse,"" along with HP Enterprise's burgeoning IaaS and hybrid cloud businesses.Growth by reductionHP Enterprise naysayers may point to last quarter's 6% drop in revenue  to $12.2 billion as a reason for its so-so ratings from the analysts. But here's the thing: Despite that sales decline, and even factoring in its $2.17 billion gain for the H3C divestiture, HP Enterprise's strict expense management efforts resulted in a 34% jump in quarterly earnings from operations to $328 million compared to last year's $244 million.It was able to improve its bottom line despite the drop in sales by shedding more than $900 million in overhead. Not only will those cost savings and bottom-line results continue to improve under Whitman's watch, the merger deals will add fuel to HP Enterprise's money-saving fire.Lean and meanAs mentioned, HP Enterprise's merger deals offer multiple benefits. One of the most intriguing aspects concerns the position HP Enterprise will be left in after the smoke clears. In discussing its spin-off decisions, the company has consistently alluded to the idea that in the future, it will be a more nimble, niche player in the IaaS and hybrid-cloud markets. And the opportunities in those arenas are nearly limitless.As per one recent estimate, the IaaS market will expand by more than 38% this year and generate  $24.4 billion, making  it the fastest-growing segment in the cloud. Expectations for hybrid cloud sales growth are also sky-high, to the tune of $91.74 billion by 2021. That's a lot of opportunity and with its fundamental strengths, mergers, cost-cutting, and market positioning, HP Enterprise is ready to lead the charge.10 stocks we like better than Hewlett Packard EnterpriseWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co Stock Could Rise,"Oct 10, 2016 at 1:45PM","A stock that's jumped 47% year to date, as HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) has in 2016, and is bumping up against its 52-week high, isn't likely to appeal to many investors. Now toss in analysts' consensus stock price estimates of just $23.02 a share -- a paltry 3% above its Oct. 7 closing of $22.34 -- and it would be easy to dismiss HP Enterprise as a train that's already left the station.But investors shouldn't throw in the proverbial towel just yet. As HP Enterprise demonstrated last quarter, it's not only carved out a definitive path for future growth, but it's already beginning to deliver. And if HP Enterprise continues producing in a few strategic areas, shareholders will have more to smile about in the years ahead.IMAGE SOURCE: HP ENTERPRISE.Three is better than oneThe decision to spin off and then merge HP Enterprise's services business with Computer Sciences Corp (NYSE:CSC) in a deal valued at approximately $8.5 billion was an eye-opener. The Enterprise Services group is HP Enterprise's second-largest division, generating $4.7 billion in revenue last quarter. That said, the unit has underperformed in several respects.Revenue declined 3% after accounting for currency and divestitures, and the enterprise service unit's meager 8.3% operating margin in fiscal 2016's third quarter really struck a negative chord. Because of HP Enterprise's shedding of its money-losing division, shareholders will pocket an estimated 50% ownership stake in the ""new"" CSC, cost synergies will total $1.5 billion after year one, and HP Enterprise margins -- a primary objective of CEO Meg Whitman's transformation plans -- will get a boost.Last month HP Enterprise also struck a CSC-like deal with U.K.-based Micro Focus (NASDAQOTH:MCFUF) to spin off and merge the ""non-core software assets"" of its money-losing software division. The deal is valued at a whopping $8.8 billion, which includes a $2.5 billion cash payment and 50.1% ownership for HP Enterprise shareholders -- all for a unit that reported $738 million in sales last quarter.Lean and meanOne of the reasons HP Enterprise split with tech industry mainstay HP last November was to unlock shareholder value, in large part by becoming a more efficiently run business. The strides HP Enterprise has already made along those lines are nothing short of spectacular.In fiscal 2015's third quarter, HP Enterprise's operating expenses totaled $12.8 billion, nearly eclipsing its $13 billion in revenue. Fast forward to this year's third quarter, and HP Enterprise's overhead dropped to $9.7 billion. Naysayers may point out that $2.17 billion of its reduced expenses was due to the shedding of HP Enterprise's H3C business, and they'd be right.However, even after accounting for the ouster of H3C, HP Enterprise pared approximately $1 billion in overhead last quarter. The result was a 34% pop in earnings from operations, to $328 million, after accounting for the H3C move. Those are impressive results, particularly given the relatively short time HP Enterprise has had to implement its cost-saving initiatives.Focus, focus, focusThe aforementioned cost savings played a critical role in the decision to part ways with HP, but it wasn't the only reason HP Enterprise opted to follow its own path. As Whitman emphasized in both the CSC and Micro Focus spinoff announcements, the objective is to position HP Enterprise with a laser-like focus on what it does best: providing ""secure hybrid IT solutions, leveraging its world-class portfolio of software-defined servers, storage, networking and converged infrastructure.""Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), one of HP Enterprise's core competencies, will generate an estimated $38 billion in sales this year. Big deal, right? That figure is expected to more than quadruple, to $173 billion, over the next 10 years, and HP Enterprise is positioning itself to lead the charge.In today's fast-paced tech world, being able to quickly adapt to changing market conditions has never been more crucial. With the company's spinoff-mergers in the works, cost-saving initiatives taking hold, and a renewed focus on what it does best -- rather than trying to be all things to all people -- HP Enterprise stock is ideally positioned for growth in the months and years ahead.10 stocks we like better than Hewlett Packard EnterpriseWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Job Cuts Are Inevitable: Here's Why That's a Good Thing,"Oct 24, 2016 at 8:26PM","Rumor has it that HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) may follow in the footsteps of its one-time cohort HP (NYSE:HPQ) and increase the number of previously announced layoffs in the near future. News that HP Enterprise would cut another 3,000 to 4,000 positions over the next three years -- on top of the 3,000 announced earlier this year -- was not taken well by investors. HP's stock is down 7% since it shared its cost-saving plans.Will HP Enterprise shareholders suffer the same fate as HP owners should the rumors of additional job cuts come to pass? Not likely. HP Enterprise stock is up 42% year-to-date, so clearly its existing restructuring plan to shave some of its global workforce hasn't scared off investors. Nor should an announcement from CEO Meg Whitman that HP Enterprise may boost its job reduction figure, as rumors suggest, for several reasons.IMAGE SOURCE: HP ENTERPRISE.Part of the planIt should be noted that the job cuts currently taking place at HP Enterprise, according to a spokesperson, are nothing more than ""previously announced restructuring changes"" and not necessarily a precursor to an additional reduction of its workforce.However, recent moves by HP Enterprise to spin off and then merge its second-largest business unit (as measured by revenue) with Computer Sciences Corp. (NYSE:CSC) will pare a significant number of its 250,000 or so employees. The much-anticipated move to merge with CSC, which is expected to close in early 2017, will accomplish more than cutting HP Enterprise's overhead -- as critical as that initiative is going forward.HP Enterprise shareholders will become 50% owners of the ""new"" CSC upon closing, in a deal valued at an estimated $8.5 billion. Not only will the combined company shave around $1 billion in expenses in the first year, but HP Enterprise will rid itself of $2.5 billion in debt, boost free cash flow, and be in a position to focus on higher-margin software defined data center (SDDC) and infrastructure services.There are similar upsides for HP Enterprise shareholders with its more recent deal to spin off and then merge its ""non-core software assets"" with U.K.-based Micro Focus (NASDAQOTH:MCFUF). The Micro Focus arrangement is valued at $8.8 billion and, similar to the CSC spinoff, includes a 50.1% ownership stake in the combined company.The Micro Focus merger also includes a $2.5 billion cash payment to HP Enterprise, but its relatively small size -- the software unit generated $718 million in revenue last quarter, compared to the enterprise services group, which reported $4.7 billion -- means it won't have the same positive impact on cutting expenses as the CSC agreement.Where to from hereEven before the split with HP, Whitman expected to reduce approximately $2.5 billion in overhead due to the aforementioned restructuring and expense management efforts. HP Enterprise's objective has always been to become a leaner, more agile company in the fast-paced world of the cloud, SDDC, and mobile. And it's working.Despite an additional $345 million expense compared to last year due to restructuring charges in its third quarter, and even factoring in a one-time gain of $2.17 billion for its H3C divestiture, HP Enterprise still managed to shave $1 billion in overhead compared to 2015. The better news is that the results of HP Enterprise's cost-cutting efforts are becoming more tangible with each passing quarter.For example, HP Enterprise reported a 6% decline in revenue year over year last quarter, but still managed to generate a 34% jump in operating earnings after accounting for the one-time H3C credit and margins also increased.HP Enterprise should continue to deliver strong bottom-line results given its penchant for minimizing costs. And if that means taking another look at its existing restructuring plan and increasing its scheduled job cuts, so be it. Some investors still prefer tightly run ships that generate profits, which HP Enterprise is positioning itself to do for years to come.  10 stocks we like better than Hewlett Packard EnterpriseWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Instant Analysis: Hewlett Packard Enterprise Declares Its First Dividend Raise,"Nov 12, 2016 at 7:05PM","What happened?It's a fine way to kick off a new fiscal year. Now in the opening days of its fiscal 2017, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) has declared the first dividend raise in its short history. The company's new quarterly payout will be just under $0.07 per share, which is $0.01 -- or 18% -- higher than its predecessor.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Just over one year ago, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise was hived off from the company now known as HP (NYSE:HPQ).Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's freshly raised dividend will be paid ""on or about"" Jan. 4, 2017, to stockholders of record as of Dec. 14, 2016. At the most recent closing share price, it would yield 1.1%. By comparison, the current average yield of dividend-paying stocks on the S&P 500 is slightly below 2.1%.Does it matter?An extra penny on the dividend, resulting in a yield barely exceeding 1%, isn't going to move the needle on Hewlett-Packard Enterprise stock (particularly considering the company's sibling, HP, pays out at a 3.2% clip).But I don't think the point of the raise was to juice the share price. Rather, the goal seems to be to reinforce CEO Meg Whitman's oft-stated ambition to keep returning money to shareholders. After all, in addition to handing out a dividend, the company also runs a big stock repurchase program. All told, it returned around $1.5 billion to shareholders in its Q3.Investors are concerned that Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's top line is eroding (it declined by 6% on a year-over-year basis in Q3). But revenue growth isn't the point -- Whitman aims to slim down the company, to the point where it's a lean, flexible business that is better able to react to its ever-changing market. A pair of spinoffs slated to take place soon is a big move in that direction.Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise is comfortably in the black on the bottom line, and it's good at generating the green stuff -- its adjusted cash flow from operations rose an encouraging 10% on a year-over-year basis in Q3. So no, this inaugural dividend raise won't mean a bull rush toward its stock, but it's a good sign of confidence in how the company's doing.10 stocks we like better than Hewlett Packard EnterpriseWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: HP Inc. or Xerox Corp?,"Oct 13, 2016 at 5:05PM","At first glance, HP (NYSE:HPQ) and Xerox (NYSE:XRX) look like dusty old tech stocks that are owned for income instead of growth. But on closer inspection, both companies' core businesses are changing substantially due to recent developments. Let's discuss these changes, and see if they're making one of these companies a better long-term investment than the other.AN HP PRINTER (L) AND A XEROX PHOTOCOPIER (R). IMAGE SOURCE: COMPANY WEBSITES.How are HP and Xerox changing?Hewlett-Packard split into two companies last year. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) retained the enterprise hardware and software businesses, while HP (NYSE:HPQ) kept selling computers, printers, and imaging devices. Those businesses are all slow growth, but the company hopes that its expansion into high-end 3D printers can revive its top-line growth. HP also recently agreed to buy Samsung's printing business for $1.05 billion to scale up its operations.Xerox plans to spin off its business-processing outsourcing operations as a new company called Conduent by the end of the year. Xerox will retain its document and services business, which competes against HP's imaging businesses. Xerox was expected to merge its document and services business with print and publishing company R.R. Donnelley earlier this year, but it rejected that deal in July.HP's strengths and weaknessesNo one is expecting much growth from HP. Its revenue is expected to fall 7% this year and another 4% next year. It's unclear how much revenue the Samsung acquisition will add to HP's top line because the unit's sales figures haven't been disclosed.Both of HP's main target markets are wobbly. Last quarter, personal systems (PC) sales fell 13% annually as printing revenues plunged 17%. But HP's earnings from continuing operations, boosted heavily by layoffs and buybacks, still rose 20% during that quarter.Gartner recently reported that worldwide PC shipments fell annually for the eighth straight quarter. But between the third quarters of 2015 and 2016, HP's market share in PCs rose from 18.8% to 20.4%, putting it in second place after market leader Lenovo.HP is the biggest maker of printers in the world, but its market share fell from 40.8% to 36.6% between the second quarters of 2015 and 2016, according to IDC, as rivals Canon and Epson both grew their shares. That market is still shrinking -- IDC reports that worldwide hardcopy peripheral sales fell nearly 4% annually in the second quarter. On the bright side, sales of large format and 3D printers have been improving.Xerox's strengths and weaknessesXerox's Document Technology revenue fell 7% annually last quarter, and Services revenue fell 2%. Analysts expect Xerox's total revenue (not accounting for the Conduent split) to fall 3% this year and another 1% next year. The businesses that make up Conduent generated $7 billion, or 39% of Xerox's revenue last year.While Xerox's top-line growth looks weak, many investors, including Carl Icahn, believe that the Conduent spinoff will strengthen both companies' earnings by streamlining their businesses and cutting costs across the board. Xerox already cut thousands of jobs earlier this year ahead of the spinoff. Those cuts, along with big buybacks, are expected to boost Xerox's full-year earnings by 15% this year.Like HP, Xerox's top line will likely benefit from higher demand for large-format printers. The company also announced that it would expand its presence in the 3D printing market in May.Growth, valuations, and dividendsAnalysts expect HP's annual earnings to grow at an average rate of just 2% over the next five years. That gives it a five-year PEG ratio of just 4.8. Because a PEG ratio under 1 is considered undervalued, HP isn't cheap relative to its earnings growth potential.Xerox's earnings, excluding the impact of the Conduent spinoff, are expected to rise 3% per year during that same period -- which gives it a lower PEG ratio of 3. However, investors looking for businesses with fewer moving parts should wait until after the spinoff concludes to determine which half of Xerox is a better long-term play.HP pays a forward yield of 3.2%, which is easily supported by its payout ratio of 22%. Xerox pays a 3.1% yield, but its payout ratio is a much higher 74%. Once again, income investors should wait for the split to see which half ends up with a higher yield. If Xerox follows HP's example (giving the ""higher growth"" HPE a lower dividend than the ""slower growth"" HP), Xerox should pay a much higher dividend than Conduent.So which stock is the better buy?I'm not bullish on either stock right now, but HP seems to be a better buy. HP is gaining economies of scale by acquiring Samsung's printing business, its PC sales could recover as enterprise demand returns, and it pays a higher dividend with a lower payout ratio. Xerox, however, is tough to recommend until it spins off Conduent, and offers investors a clearer picture of both companies' futures."
3 Reasons Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co. Stock Is Still Cheap,"Nov 4, 2016 at 7:41AM","With a consensus price target  of just $23.15, HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) doesn't have the pundits too bullish on its immediate future. As of Oct. 31, HP Enterprise stock was sitting at $22.47, which equates to a 3% upside. Thanks to its phenomenal year-to-date gain of nearly 47%, it's easy to see why analysts think the stock has little room for near-term growth.But there are several factors working in HP Enterprise's favor that don't seem to be factored into its so-so rating. Investors in search of relatively stable, long-term growth shouldn't shy away because of its stock price performance. The ""new"" HP Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman envisioned when it split with PC and printer king HP is becoming a reality.IMAGE SOURCE: HP ENTERPRISE.The bottom line mattersLast quarter was a good indication of what investors can expect going forward, and it may offer some insight into why the Street's expectations are muted. One of the first metrics that jumps out from 2016's fiscal third quarter was the 6% decline in revenue compared with a year ago.Measuring HP Enterprise's results solely on top-line growth isn't consistent with its plans for the future. Whitman has made it clear that going forward, HP Enterprise will be a leaner, more nimble company, able to quickly react to market changes and opportunities as they arise. That push is beginning to pay off, in the form of operating results.For example, last quarter's cash flow from operations jumped 10% year over year to $1.7 billion, which has helped HP Enterprise strengthen its already sound balance sheet. Compared with 2015, HP Enterprise increased its cash and equivalents by a whopping $900 million and now boasts $10.74 billion. And that growth came in addition to an aggressive share-buyback initiative that's reduced HP Enterprise's shares outstanding by more than 100 million since last year.Lower revenue, higher profitEven factoring in a one-time gain of $2.17 billion  relating the divestiture of H3C, HP Enterprise still reported a nearly 35% increase in earnings from operations of $328 million last quarter. The leaner, more nimble HP Enterprise is already taking shape.HP Enterprise also shaved about $1 billion in expenses, which would have translated to essentially flat earnings-per-share results despite its drop in quarterly sales. There's more than one way to grow profits -- though top-line growth is nice, some investors appreciate a consistently profitable company, which HP Enterprise certainly is.The recent split-merger announcements with Computer Sciences Corp. (NYSE:CSC) and Micro Focus (NASDAQOTH:MCFUF) are expected to be complete the first quarter of 2017, and each will mark a monumental step in becoming a more agile HP Enterprise. The  CSC deal alone will shed some 100,000 jobs, more than half of HP Enterprise's total workforce.Going forwardThe mergers with CSC and Micro Focus -- in addition to increasing margin and allowing HP Enterprise to focus on its more profitable businesses -- will also result in a 50% stake in the new companies for shareholders. That three-for-one deal is awfully attractive, but the CSC and Micro Focus moves will also benefit HP Enterprise's strong cash position even further.In addition to part ownership in CSC and Micro Focus, the latter will also write HP Enterprise a $2.5 billion  check, bringing the total value of the merger to $8.8 billion, slightly larger than the $8.5 billion arrangement with CSC. That additional cash, on top of the nearly $11 billion already on the balance sheet, opens up a lot of opportunities, including niche acquisitions.The recently closed $275 million  Silicon Graphics Inc. deal not only gives HP Enterprise a leg up in the $11 billion big-data analytics market, but it may also be a precursor of things to come. Acquiring specific technologies is a quick means of expanding its product offerings, and HP Enterprise has the financial wherewithal to do it.For investors who appreciate profits, improving margins, and a strong balance sheet, HP Enterprise still represents a great value, regardless of what the pundits think. "
Better Buy: Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. vs. Cisco Systems Inc.,"Oct 25, 2016 at 9:45AM","Though both stocks are up year to date, HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shareholders have had a bumpy ride in the last month or so, with shares declining 6% and 4%, respectively. Rumor has it that HP Enterprise will announce additional job cuts, though a spokesperson said its simply following through with its existing restructuring plan.Cisco is also going through a transformation, which explains its own round of layoffs that began this quarter. As many as 5,500 employees, equal to 7% of Cisco's global workforce, will be let go. Neither Cisco's nor HP Enterprise's realignments are surprising given their push to expand in the cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) markets, but that hasn't prevented investors from getting antsy.The upside is the recent share-price declines have made both HP Enterprise and Cisco even better investment opportunities, making the question of which is the better buy almost a toss-up.IMAGE SOURCE: CISCO.Why Cisco is a good buyDespite perceptions to the contrary, Cisco's decision to pare its workforce isn't purely about cutting overhead. The objective is to shift resources away from what Cisco refers to as ""lower growth areas"" so it can ""further invest in key priority areas such as security, IoT, collaboration, next generation data center and cloud.""Impressively, even in the midst of Cisco's business transition, it's still performing admirably, particularly in the key areas that will drive future growth. Excluding Cisco's ""other"" unit and its now-divested SP video business, last fiscal year's best-performing divisions are a snapshot of CEO Chuck Robbins' strategic plan.Security revenue climbed 13% in fiscal 2016 compared to a year-ago to $1.97 billion, and its collaboration unit -- its third-largest revenue source behind only legacy routers and switches -- increased 9% to $4.45 billion. Toss in the $3.7 billion in data center sales, much of which is cloud-related, and Cisco is already delivering where it counts. And Cisco's 3.5% dividend yield doesn't hurt either.IMAGE SOURCE: HP ENTERPRISE.Why HP Enterprise is a good buyChange isn't always viewed favorably by investors, but the significant restructuring of HP Enterprise should prove to be a win-win before long. CEO Meg Whitman got the ball rolling earlier this year when she announced the tax-free spinoff and merger of HP Enterprise's second-largest unit -- enterprise services -- with Computer Sciences Corp.The $8.5 billion deal with CSC includes a 50% stake in the new ""pure-play"" powerhouse, a $1.5 billion cash dividend, and HP Enterprise will rid itself of $2.5 billion in debt. For an encore, HP Enterprise also announced a similar deal for its ""non-core software assets"" with U.K.-based Micro Focus. The $8.8 billion merger with Micro Focus also includes an ownership stake of 50.1% for HP Enterprise shareholders, along with a $2.5 billion one-time payment for Whitman and team.By the end of March 2017 -- the expected closing dates of the mergers -- HP Enterprise shareholders will own shares of three separate entities, pocket a nice dividend, and Whitman will be closer to her strategy of ""creating a faster-growing, higher-margin, stronger cash flow company."" Enterprise services did generate $4.7 billion in revenue last quarter, but it was also HP Enterprise's lowest margin unit by a wide margin, and software was its worst-performing division.Shedding businesses not related to HP Enterprise's core competencies will help it focus on what it does best: delivering Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) in the cloud. This year, IaaS is expected to become a $294 billion market, easily making it the cloud's largest segment, and HP Enterprise is poised to garner its share.HP Enterprise and Cisco both offer tremendous upside in fast-growing markets, but the latter's stellar 3.5% dividend yield makes it the better buy for growth and income investors.

Why Analysts Are Wrong About Hewlett Packard Enterprise Stock,"Dec 12, 2016 at 3:38PM","Uncertainty is a concern for investors and analysts alike, so perhaps it's the pending changes at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) that are to blame for the bearishness around it. HP Enterprise stock ended trading Friday at $24.51 a share with an average target price of $25 equal to all of 2% upside.Those tepid attitudes could be related to the fact that analysts' time frames tend to be around 12 months, or that HP Enterprise stock has already soared 61% year-to-date. But for investors with some patience, there are several reasons HP Enterprise warrants a long look, despite the negative sentiments.IMAGE SOURCE: HP ENTERPRISE.Change is goodHP Enterprise's decision to spin off and merge its Enterprise Services unit with Computer Sciences Corp. (NYSE:CSC) likely added fuel to some bears' fire. The estimated $8.5 billion deal with CSC is expected to close the end of March, about the same time another significant change should come to fruition.HP Enterprise is also selling off most of its software division assets to another tech giant, U.K.-based Micro Focus (NASDAQOTH:MCFUF). The deal with Micro Focus is valued at a whopping $8.8 billion and will create ""one of the world's largest pure-play enterprise software companies.""Before you follow the lead of those HP Enterprise analysts who are running for the hills, there are a few things worth considering as regards the CSC and Micro Focus deals. First, when the smoke clears HP Enterprise shareholders will be the proud owners of approximately 50% of each IT leader.With their respective target markets -- IT services in the case of CSC, and enterprise software for Micro Focus -- along with HP Enterprise's cloud infrastructure and other solutions, shareholders will gain exposure to three leaders in their segments. And there are additional benefits that fall right in line with CEO Meg Whitman's vision of HP Enterprise's future.Solid as a rockWhitman's efforts to streamline HP Enterprise into a more nimble player in hyper-growth markets including infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) -- which is expected to grow over 38% this year in public cloud sales alone -- include managing costs. Last quarter, HP Enterprise shaved more than $1.6 billion in overhead, decreasing spending across every area.The CSC arrangement is expected to remove about 100,000 employees -- and their associated costs -- from HP Enterprise's books. And the positive impact of cutting costs is already evident. Despite reporting a 2% drop in revenue to $12.5 billion after one-time items, HP Enterprise delivered an impressive 11% increase in earnings per share (EPS) to $0.61, along with better operating margin.HP Enterprise's already rock-solid balance sheet will also benefit. A year ago, HP Enterprise was sitting on $9.84 billion in cash and equivalents, which in and of itself was more than adequate. In the recent quarter, HP Enterprise's ready cash position climbed over $3 billion to $12.99 billion and will get even better with the pending deals.The agreement with Micro Focus, in addition to shareholders' 50.1% ownership stake, includes a $2.5 billion cash payment to HP Enterprise. So when it's said and done, HP Enterprise will be ideally positioned to fill gaps in its product suite with targeted, niche acquisitions similar to the $275 million deal for big data analytics and computing provider SGI. One more thingThe aforementioned year-to-date stock gains of 61% might suggest HP Enterprise stock is overvalued, but in fact it's just the opposite. Based on its P/E ratio of 13, HP Enterprise is one of the least expensive alternatives in its sandbox. Looking ahead, HP Enterprise is valued at just 11 times future earnings.Here's the bottom line: Long-term investors shouldn't let analyst negativity, pending changes, or HP Enterprise's stellar 2016 performance scare them off. It's delivering EPS growth and paring expenses. Its shareholders will soon own three IT leaders and its strong balance sheet is getting stronger. That's simply too many positives to warrant the negative sentiments."
Better Buy: Hewlett Packard Enterprise vs. IBM,"Nov 11, 2016 at 12:00PM","Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) have been major rivals in the enterprise hardware and software markets for decades. Both stocks are also considered slow-growth ""mature"" tech plays owned for stability instead of growth. Let's take a closer look at these two tech giants to see which is the better long-term buy at current prices.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Understanding HPE's business modelHPE split with HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), which retained HP's PC and printing businesses, late last year. HPE generates most of its revenue from four main divisions -- the enterprise group (51% of revenues last quarter), enterprise services (37%), software (6%), and financial services (6%).The enterprise group unit provides IT infrastructure solutions, the enterprise services unit provides IT consulting services, the software unit provides automated IT solutions, and the financial services unit provides financing options and scalable IT solutions like consumption-based pricing.Even before splitting with HP, HPE focused on downsizing its businesses. In a stunning move, it exited the competitive public cloud market last October. Earlier this year, HPE announced plans to spin off and merge its struggling IT services unit with Computer Science Corp. (NYSE:CSC) in an $8.5 billion deal. In September, it announced it would also spin off and merge ""non-core"" assets like application delivery management, big data, and enterprise security with Micro Focus International in an $8.8 billion deal.Those spinoffs, along with other cost-cutting measures, resulted in hundreds of layoffs. However, HPE is still making strategic acquisitions of higher-growth, data-driven businesses like supercomputer maker SGI, which it recently acquired for $275 million.Understanding IBM's business modelIBM's top line is split between five units -- cognitive solutions (22% of revenues last quarter), global business services (22%), technology services and cloud platforms (45%), systems (8%), and global financing (2%).Cognitive solutions include its solutions software and transaction processing software; global business services cover its IT consulting services, global process services, and application management; and tech and cloud platforms include its infrastructure services, tech support, and integration software. Systems include its high-end servers, mainframes, and OS software, and the financing arm handles financing and used product sales.Like HPE, IBM has been streamlining its business by divesting slower-growth units like its desktop PC, low-end server, and chipmaking businesses. But unlike HPE, IBM is more aggressively focused on bulking up its higher-growth ""strategic imperatives"" businesses (cloud, analytics, security, mobility, social) with acquisitions. Big Blue has already acquired a dozen companies in 2016 to strengthen those businesses -- which posted 16% annual sales growth last quarter and accounted for 40% of its trailing-12-month revenue.How fast are HPE and IBM growing?HPE and IBM are both struggling to grow their top lines amid sluggish enterprise spending, currency headwinds, and tough competition from nimbler rivals. HPE's sales fell 6.5% annually last quarter, and analysts expect its revenues to fall 1% next year. IBM has reported 18 consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales declines, and analysts expect its revenue to fall about 2% this year and another 0.3% next year.But on the bottom line, HPE's earnings are expected to improve 4% this year and 7% next year thanks to aggressive cost-cutting measures, divestments, and buybacks. IBM's earnings are expected to fall 10% this year, due to a drastic reduction in buybacks and higher investments in its strategic imperatives, but possibly rebound 3% next year.Which stock is a better income play?HPE returned $2.9 billion to shareholders -- mostly through $2.7 billion in buybacks -- during the first three quarters of the year. HPE believes its cash position in fiscal 2017 will be strengthened considerably by over $1 billion in cash and debt transfers from CSC and a $2.5 billion cash dividend from Micro Focus. This means its current forward yield of 1%, which pales in comparison to HP's 3.3% yield, might get a big increase next year.IBM returned $6.6 billion to its shareholders over the past three quarters with $4 billion in dividends and the rest in buybacks. Big Blue currently pays a forward yield of 3.6%, and it has hiked that dividend annually for 16 years.The valuations and the verdict....HPE currently trades at 10 times earnings, which is lower than IBM's P/E of 13 and the industry average of 21 for IT services providers. HPE also has a P/S ratio of 0.7, which is much lower than IBM's P/S ratio of 1.8.It's a close call, but HPE's more streamlined business model, stronger earnings growth, and lower valuation make it a more compelling buy than IBM. IBM remains a solid income play for conservative investors, but I believe its stock currently has less upside potential than HPE's.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: HP Inc. vs. Xerox,"Jul 29, 2016 at 11:07AM","IMAGE SOURCE: HP INC.HP (NYSE:HP) and Xerox (NYSE:XRX) share many similarities. The history of each firm stretches back many decades, and both have played an integral role in shaping the current technology landscape. They both derive significant revenue from the sale of printers and ink. They both pay fairly healthy dividends.But which company belongs in your portfolio? Let's take a closer look to see which makes for a more attractive investment.Two companies for the price of oneXerox will go through a major change later this year. The company, which has three main operating segments, plans to cleave its business in two, creating two smaller companies in the process. Current Xerox shareholders and those investors that become shareholders before the split will receive stock in both companies -- called Xerox and Conduent -- likely by the end of the year. The move was driven by activist investor Carl Icahn. Icahn, who has engineered similar splits in the past, will hold board seats at both companies, and investors should be mindful of his involvement. Icahn has had his fair share of failures, but his recent technology track record is strong. eBay shareholders have benefited from the PayPal spinoff he orchestrated back in 2014, as the two companies have collectively outperformed the S&P 500 since they began trading as independent firms.Conduent will be composed of Xerox's current Business Process Outsourcing segment, while the new, smaller Xerox will be made up of the company's Document Technology and Document Outsourcing segments. Essentially, Xerox will be a company focused on printers; Conduent will be one centered around a variety of administrative services, including HR outsourcing, customer service, and healthcare claims processing.It's hard to say for certain how the market will value these two firms, but it's possible that Conduent will be given a higher valuation. Xerox's annual revenue has declined in recent years, largely because of falling demand for its document technology and document outsourcing. Business Process Outsourcing revenue has also declined, but not to the same extent. Xerox's total revenue fell nearly 10% from 2013 to 2015, but its Business Process Outsourcing revenue declined only 4%.But the document business could also have some value. Earlier this month, R.R. Donnelley, a competitor in the space, proposed a merger with Xerox that would've combined its own printing assets with Xerox's. That deal was rejected by Xerox's board, but suggests that the post-split Xerox could make for an attractive acquisition target.PCs and printersHP is the byproduct of a similar split, one that the saw the former Hewlett-Packard company break up into two firms. HP Inc. is composed of what was once Hewlett-Packard's PC and printer businesses. HP's PC business brings in more revenue, but printers are more profitable. Last quarter, PCs generated 60% of HP's total sales and 24% of its earnings before taxes; printers were responsible for the balance.Both businesses are in decline. PC sales fell 10% on an annual basis last quarter, while printing revenue contracted 16%. To reignite growth, HP is looking to 3D printing, new PC designs, and innovative new devices.At least on Wall Street, 3D printing has lost its luster in recent years, but HP's management views it as an opportunity. ""...[W]e're very bullish,"" said HP CEO Dion Weisler on the company's last earnings call. ""We have a long and complex...roadmap. This is not easy to duplicate. We're leveraging more than 5,000 patents from our core; leveraging 30 years of innovation that we've had in our printing business and we're bringing it to bear into a market that really hasn't had a very large mainstream player with a brand that HP has and a reputation that we have.""Earlier this year, HP launched the Spectre, the world's thinnest laptop. It's a premium product, a market segment HP appears to be increasingly focused on. ""We grew double digits year-over-year in this profitable segment, while the broader consumer premium market declined,"" Weisler said. Next month, HP will start selling the Elite x3, a Windows 10-powered smartphone that can double as a laptop.HP is a cheaper stock, but Xerox might be the better buyUnder most methods of valuation, HP looks like the less expensive stock, with a single-digit price-to-earnings ratio and a greater dividend yield. Xerox still yields a respectable 3.13%, but its trailing price-to-earnings ratio has skyrocketed since it announced its forthcoming split earlier this year. Both companies bring in sizable cash flows -- HP generated $1.5 billion last quarter; Xerox expects to generate between $600 million and $850 million this quarter.If you're looking for a dividend-paying tech stock to add to your portfolio, both could be attractive, but I would give the edge to Xerox.With the looming split, there's more uncertainty surrounding Xerox than HP, but its business isn't declining as rapidly. At the same time, it doesn't have to contend with the PC market, which continues to experience regular quarterly declines. In April, research firm IDC reported that PC shipments fell 11.5% in the first quarter. Finally, Icahn's track record and the possibility of an acquisition give Xerox potential for more upside."
The Best Tech Stocks of 2016,"Dec 14, 2016 at 9:00AM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The S&P 500 index has gained 10.4% so far in 2016. The market barometer is heading toward a very respectable annual return, well above the 8.2% average gain seen in the last 20 years.But some stocks made even these rosy returns look downright stale by comparison. Sifting through the S&P 500's finest year-to-date performers, the top three names in the tech sector are NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Computer Sciences (NYSE:CSC), and Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT).Here's how those three tech tickers have gained 76% or more in 2016.AMAT DATA BY YCHARTS.For this semiconductor equipment builder, the 2016 surge was all about showing solid results. Applied Materials has presented four quarterly reports this year, exceeding earnings expectations in each one.The company is taking market share from its chip-building equipment rivals, leading the way with gear capable of churning out 3D memory chips and next-generation manufacturing processes. Investors are benefiting from a strong pre-holiday surge in display panel orders along with an industrywide move toward high-performance SSD storage equipment.The May surprise lifted share prices more than 13% in a single day, and Applied Materials has gained 72% year to date. The stock is exploring multiyear highs, dating all the way back to the dot-com boom 15 years ago.CSC DATA BY YCHARTS.Fresh off a focus-sharpening spinoff of its own, Computer Sciences agreed to merge with the enterprise services division of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) in May. Computer Sciences shares immediately jumped more than 35% when that announcement was made.That was the start of an 85% year-to-date surge, but far from the whole story. Computer Sciences added an 11% gain in September thanks to a strong business review and new global partnerships in the cloud computing field. The HP Enterprise spin-merger is still pending, expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.Computer Sciences was already a strong player in the enterprise consulting services market, but the addition of HP's competing unit is still a game-changing merger of equals. I can't wait to see how this two-headed beast will evolve as a unified business.NVDA DATA BY YCHARTSAnd that brings us to the tech sector's strongest performer in 2016. NVIDIA has gone from strength to strength in recent quarters, and share prices have nearly tripled, with a 178% return so far.This is one of those overnight successes that actually were years in the making. The brand new Pascal microarchitecture behind NVIDIA's current range of graphics processors and number-crunching chips has been in development for at least two years. These platform upgrades are not always successful, but Pascal turned out to be a home run in terms of raw performance, power efficiency, and street pricing.Back in May, when the first Pascal-based processors were about to hit the market, NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang promised to sell ""a lot of Pascal"" in the second quarter. The company followed through on that promise and continued to crush every target in the third quarter as well.NVIDIA investors aren't just enjoying multiyear highs these days. The stock has exceeded its dot-com highs by a wide margin and sets all-time records on a regular basis. With Pascal under its belt, Nvidia should be able to keep executing for the foreseeable future, as the company delves deeper into automotive computing and data center server-class products.10 stocks we like better than NvidiaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

CyberArk Software Ltd Gets a Big Win With HPE Deal,"Jul 31, 2016 at 2:07PM","Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) recently partnered with CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) to launch the HPE Privileged Account Management (PAM) Service, which will expand its HPE Managed Security Services portfolio by protecting internal accounts from hackers or disgruntled employees.According to CyberArk, 80% of all targeted attacks exploit privileged accounts during the attack process. Research firm Gartner predicts that regulatory fines for organizations with deficient PAM controls could rise 40% by 2017.IMAGE SOURCE: HEWLETT-PACKARD ENTERPRISE.The new service will combine the resources of ten HPE Security Operations Centers worldwide with CyberArk's PAM platform to help organizations address major security challenges like insider threats, malware, advanced targeted attacks, and the outsourcing of internal information. CyberArk's platform can be deployed on-premise, in the hybrid cloud, and within other controlled environments. Let's take a look at what this deal means for both companies.What this deal means for CyberArkHPE's choice of CyberArk as its PAM partner reaffirms its position as the ""best in breed"" leader in the niche sector. Research firm IDC calls CyberArk the ""PAM pure-play 'big gorilla' with the most revenue and largest customer base"" in the market. Its PAM solution is used by over 2,600 customers worldwide, including 40% of Fortune 100 companies and 17 of the 20 biggest banks in the world. It's also the only comprehensive PAM solution certified by the U.S. Department of Defense.Partnering with HPE also complements the C3 Alliance, a PAM consortium CyberArk launched in April. Those partners, which include Symantec, Intel Security, FireEye, and now HPE, will integrate CyberArk's PAM solutions into their own security platforms. The C3 Alliance helps CyberArk counter the threat of bigger and more diversified competitors like CA disrupting the market with cheaper bundled PAM solutions.HPE's partnership also indicates that potential rivals can become allies. HPE's IAM (Identity and Access Management) Service initially seemed like a threat to CyberArk, but HPE is now integrating CyberArk's solutions into the platform to increase its effectiveness. IBM's own PAM platform was also once considered a threat, but Big Blue also integrated CyberArk's PAM solutions into its Security QRadar SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform last December.What this deal means for HPEHPE's security portfolio is part of its Software business, which also includes its big data and IT management software. Revenue at that unit fell 13% annually to $774 million last quarter and accounted for 6% of the company's top line. HPE noted that weak demand for IT management software offset gains from its security and big data solutions. However, pre-tax income at the Software business rose 21% to $192 million, or 15% of its bottom line, thanks to better cost controls.HPE's security business is small, but it's categorized as a high growth segment alongside its cloud and big data businesses. During the first quarter, HPE noted that revenue from those three units rose 30% annually, but it didn't provide an exact sales figure (the cloud business is included in the Enterprise Services segment) or update that percentage during the second quarter.Like CyberArk, HPE is trying to expand the reach of its security platform by integrating it with other companies' platforms via the HPE Security Technology Alliance Program. Sales of security software to these customers can lead to purchases of HPE's other IT, cloud, big data, and enterprise hardware and software solutions. That bundling strategy can widen its moat against major enterprise rivals like IBM. Therefore, HPE investors shouldn't simply value its security business in terms of revenue or operating income -- it can also be considered a way to tether new organizations to its ecosystem.A great deal for CyberArk, a good one for HPEThis partnership is a win-win deal for CyberArk and HPE, but it will likely benefit the former more than the latter. That's because it reinforces CyberArk's dominance of the PAM market, ensuring its niche is well-protected and that its business can generate over 30% sales growth this year. As for HPE, the partnership strengthens its small but growing security business, but it probably won't make a meaningful impact on its top or bottom line growth."
1 Stock for Investing in 3D Printing,"Aug 7, 2016 at 8:32AM","SOME 3D PRINTING STOCKS HAVE CRASHED. THAT DOESN'T MEAN ALL 3D PRINTING STOCKS ARE TRASH. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Once touted as the hottest ride in the industrials sector, the 3D printing industry has lately found investors holding a round-trip ticket. Over the past five years, shareholders of Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) -- the two biggest names in the 3D sector -- have seen their stocks first skyrocket, then crater. Today, shares of both stocks trade for about what they cost five years ago.Indeed, Stratasys shares actually sell for less today than they were worth five years ago.That's not entirely surprising. After all, while Stratasys and 3D Systems began this decade with positive profits, both stocks have seen their earnings plummet, and both are unprofitable today. But that doesn't mean the 3D printing sector is entirely without hope. As it matures, new players are entering the industry -- and some of them are even earning profits.Today, we've invited three of our analysts to tell you about their favorite. Let's listen in.SSYS AND 3D DATA BY YCHARTS.2D printing -- evolvedRich Smith: Let's start off with the company that is itself partially to blame for the falloff in stock prices at Stratasys and 3D Systems: ""2D printing"" goliath HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ).Last month, research house Piper Jaffray blamed HP and its introduction of a Fusion Jet printer to compete with models sold by Stratasys and 3D Systems for scaring buyers away from buying what might soon become old technology. According to Piper, its survey of the 3D printing industry suggests that buyers have decided to ""pause purchasing to assess"" their options lately, with the result that sales across the industry have stalled. Additionally, ""several existing DDD and SSYS resellers are likely to partner with HP,"" warns Piper, and this ""will likely distract channels and stress relationships"" among the former leading companies in this industry.Now, 3D printing is not exactly HP's primary focus, and HP stock is far from a ""pure play"" on 3D printing. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, HP still gets far more revenue from traditional 2D printing-on-paper, and even more revenue from the sale of PCs, than from its nascent 3D market. But that shouldn't disqualify the stock as a candidate for consideration by 3D printing investors. At last report, HP shares were selling for just 7.4 times earnings. With the stock paying a big 3.5% dividend yield, HP's dividend alone justifies about half the stock's P/E ratio, meaning HP doesn't need to grow much at all to justify its share price.Could 3D printing be the catalyst that provides that little bit of needed growth? I think it could. But just in case you disagree, here are two more ideas for you.That's not a tech company!Reuben Gregg Brewer: My pick for a 3D printing company is a bit unconventional, given that Alcoa Inc. (NYSE:AA) is best known as an aluminum maker. But here's the thing: It also produces specialty parts for industries such as aerospace. And it's been using 3D printing, also dubbed ""additive manufacturing,"" to make specialty parts for more than 20 years. In fact, the company inked a deal with Airbus in April to supply 3D-printed titanium fuselage and engine pylon parts to the plane maker, and it recently spent $60 million to speed up its broader 3D printing plans.That said, Alcoa isn't the only aerospace company printing parts. But one of the key things it does is make the metal ""inks"" used in the 3D printing process, which keys off its experience and expertise in the metals space. So it could end up being a key supplier to other manufacturers using 3D printing. That's interesting, but the really exciting thing about Alcoa is its Ampliforge technology.Ampliforge is a process that the company claims increases the strength of 3D-printed parts beyond what printing alone can achieve. If Ampliforge proves a sustainable competitive advantage, Alcoa could end up dominating the aerospace niche of the 3D printing market, where light weight and durability are both key issues. Now that really is something to get excited about.IMAGE SOURCE: ALCOA.There are a lot of moving parts at Alcoa today, as it looks to break itself up into a metals business, which will retain the Alcoa name, and a specialty parts company, to be known as Arconic. But if you are interested in 3D printing, you may want to do the homework to understand what Alcoa is achieving in the space today -- it could set the company up to be a big player in a growing 3D printing niche. Note, however, that it's Arconic that will own the 3D printing business once the parts division is finally spun off.Buy the printer, or buy the printer buyer?Steve Heller: Although the 3D printing industry has experienced a notable slowdown in customer demand over the past 18 months, which has put downward pressure on 3D printer hardware sales at 3D Systems and Stratasys, the growth of 3D printing services has been on the rise. Service bureaus are essentially a ""Kinko's"" for 3D printing, allowing customers to take advantage of 3D printing without requiring the expertise or capital to invest in professional-grade 3D printing technology.Given this value proposition, Proto Labs (NYSE:PRLB), a quick-turn manufacturer and 3D printing service provider, appears to be in a great position to benefit from the overall rise in 3D printing and outsourced rapid manufacturing. During the second quarter, Proto Labs' 3D printing revenue grew by 66.7% to $9.1 million, which represented about 12% of its total revenue. Excluding Alphaform, a German-based 3D printing service bureau that Proto Labs recently acquired, Proto Labs' legacy 3D printing revenue increased by 29% year over year.To put Proto Labs' overall revenue growth in perspective, here's how it compares with 3D Systems and Stratasys since the start of 2015 -- when industry demand started slowing:REVENUE (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.Additionally, operating a 100% services-based business gives Proto Labs a notable competitive edge over 3D printing hardware manufacturers. After all, Proto Labs doesn't sell 3D printers, meaning it's really a 3D printing customer that purchases from hardware makers.In other words, Proto Labs is a technology-agnostic company that is free to adopt the best 3D printing technology on the market for its customers. This is a favorable position compared to 3D Systems and Stratasys, which have to defend themselves from the upcoming entrance of HP's Multi Jet Fusion and the recently introduced Carbon M1. As these new entrants jockey for position against 3D Systems and Stratasys, Proto Labs can merely sit back and choose whatever technology it pleases.Before jumping in, it's worth noting that Proto Labs' expenses have started to outpace its revenue growth, which has caused its profits to stagnate. Most recently, Proto Labs' second-quarter operating margin fell from 27.1% last year to 19.8% this year, as total operating expenses grew by a blistering 35.6% year over year -- more than twice as fast as its revenue growth rate. However, if Proto Labs can stabilize its expenses while it continues to grow its revenue, this situation may only be temporary.Caveat investorAnd there you have it, folks.

Why HP Inc. Needs to Win the 3D Printing Market,"Nov 9, 2016 at 10:00AM","CEO Dion Weisler has HP's (NYSE:HPQ) PC unit flying high. Despite the negativity surrounding the global PC market -- shipments declined again by nearly 6% last quarter -- HP continues to make headway in its race to catch China-based Lenovo and take over the top spot.The strength of HP's PC unit has been the impetus for its stock jumping 27% year to date. That's the good news. The not-so-good news is that HP's printing division in general and supply sales in particular have been dismal for several quarters now. For HP to reach its valuation potential, the printing division needs to at least hold its own, and the expected surge in the commercial 3D printing market could be just what the doctor ordered.IMAGE SOURCE: HP.The time is ripe for 3D printingAccording to a comprehensive study of 2015 3D printing sales, the manufacturing industry alone reported a 25.9% increase to $5.17 billion. Toss in over 278,000 desktop 3D printing units -- these are generally considered devices costing under $5,000 -- and it's clear the negative headlines surrounding the burgeoning marketplace that still occasionally crop up are incorrect.In fact, as quickly as manufacturing and similar industries are adopting 3D printing, the seemingly sky-high estimates could prove to be conservative. One market estimate suggests 3D printing will generate $7 billion this year, nearly double to $13 billion by 2018, and will continue to climb to a whopping $21 billion by 2020.To put the opportunity that 3D printing presents into perspective, the commercial hardware segment of HP's printing division reported just $1.29 billion in sales last quarter, down 3% compared to a year ago. Worse yet, it was HP's best-performing segment. Supplies revenue -- which generates more than half the revenue of its printing division -- took a beating last quarter, nosediving 18% to $2.84 billion.HP's supplies sales woes could also be remedied by 3D printing. The laundry list of materials required to complete various 3D printing applications is seemingly endless. That said, thermoplastic filament alone is forecast to become a nearly $7 billion market in the next 10 years. Now, add in the dozen or so other materials widely used to complete various manufacturing operations and the revenue possibilities are enormous.Where to from here?As it stands, HP is nowhere to be seen in a list of top-selling 3D printer manufacturers. The market is still led by upstarts Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), and privately held XYZ Printing, among a slew of others. Stratasys and 3D Systems, in particular, have bull's-eyes on their backs as folks like HP enter the picture.HP was late to the 3D party, but its two Fusion commercial 3D printing offerings have already made a splash. According to an industry analyst, one factor in the so-so quarters both Stratasys and 3D Systems reported recently may have been due to manufacturers holding off on purchasing a new unit until HP's Fusions were readily available.Though HP isn't on the 3D printing sales radar just yet, it appears the all-important manufacturing sector is eager to give it a look before opting for a Stratasys or 3D Systems device. Combined with the still new-ish Design Jet desktop solution, HP now has its 3D ducks in a row, and investors should begin to see early results in another quarter, or two.It won't take too many 3D printer sales to move the needle, either. HP's low-end Fusion 3D printer will sell in the $120,000 to $155,000 range, while its elite 4200 model could climb to over $200,000 depending on operational requirements. With those price points, HP won't have to sell millions to make an impact on its top and bottom lines. And HP's 3D printer prices are less than half comparable units from Stratasys or 3D Systems.The 3D printing market isn't exactly low-hanging fruit, but with HP's global reach and eagerly anticipated offerings, both its hardware and supplies revenue woes could be cured in one fell swoop.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: HP vs. IBM,"Jul 4, 2016 at 8:08AM","Though they play in different sandboxes after recent decisions altered their respective businesses, both HP (NYSE:HPQ) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) still have a lot in common. In addition to being signature members of the tech industry's ""old guard,"" both HP and IBM have undergone drastic, and much-needed, transformations the past couple of years.HP's decision to split off its software and services unit into Hewlett-Packard Enterprises to focus on its PC and printing solutions was a big one, to be sure. But IBM's transformation away from chips, hardware, and related old-school technologies has been just as impactful for shareholders. So, which is the better buy, HP or IBM?IMAGE SOURCE: HP.The case for HPMost tech investors are aware of the dire condition of the world's PC market. According to technology research company Gartner, worldwide PC shipments declined again in the first quarter, to 64.8 million units -- the lowest number since 2007. About the only good news following the dismal report is that HP's 11.41 million PC units moved during the first quarter was a slight improvement in market share, to 17.6%.Last quarter's 10% decline in revenue from the personal systems segment, to $6.99 billion, could have been much worse if not for HP's relatively strong commercial sales, which dropped a ""mere"" 7%. Revenue from HP's consumer segment fell 16% in fiscal 2016's second quarter. The question is, how does HP stop the bleeding? By positioning itself as the innovation leader -- case in point, HP's new Spectre laptop, billed as the ""world's thinnest.""HP also has plans to kick-start its printing business, which really took a beating in Q2, dropping 16%, to $4.64 billion. Once again, consumer sales was the culprit, with printer revenue down a whopping 18%. For HP, a continued emphasis on enterprise sales and its foray into the 3D printing market could be the unit's saving grace.3D printing generated $5.17 billion in revenue last year, and HP's latest ""production-ready 3D printing system,"" along with its bevy of desktop units, should give it a leg up in what are still the early stages of the budding industry.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.The case for IBMIBM's transformation continues to dictate how CEO Ginni Rometty and team are looking to the future. IBM stock has quietly risen 9% this year (HP is up 4.5%), but that has hardly quieted its critics as total revenue continues to decline. However, to determine which stock is the better buy, investors need to recognize Rometty's ""strategic imperatives"" are the future of IBM.IBM reported a 4.6% drop in revenue in Q1, to $18.68 billion, and will likely mark further declines when it shares Q2 results July 18. The naysayers also lament IBM's nearly 21% drop in hardware and related sales last quarter, but those are legacy businesses. IBM's success will be determined by its performance in the cloud, cognitive computing or artificial intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT) analytics.Toward that end, IBM's Q1 wasn't quite hitting on all cylinders, but there was a lot to like. Combined, strategic imperative sales are now at an annual run rate of $29.8 billion, equal to 37% of total revenue. Thanks in large part to the opportunity IBM's cognitive computing solutions represent, analysts think strategic imperatives will account for over 50% of IBM's revenue by this time next year -- well ahead of Rometty's own target of 40% by 2018.HP and IBM share another important characteristic: Each is near the top of the dividend-paying heap in the tech industry. HP's dividend yield is 4%, while IBM is close behind, offering shareholders 3.75%. But when it comes to which stock offers the best opportunity going forward, IBM has the upper hand, for a couple of reasons.First, HP is overly reliant on PCs and printers, both dying industries in their current form. HP's innovative tablets and 3D printers should give shareholders some hope, but there remain too many uncertainties and obstacles to overcome. Second, IBM's migration into cloud, AI, and IoT analytics sales offers limitless upside, as each category is further along the growth curve than HP's tablets or 3D printers. Investor patience is necessary in either case, but IBM will reward that patience before HP manages to."
Here's Why the Best Is Yet to Come for Hewlett-Packard Company,"Mar 12, 2017 at 1:00PM","When HP (NYSE:HPQ) split with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) in late 2015, the former seemed more like a slower-growth income play than the latter. But over the past 12 months, HP shares rallied 55%, outperforming HPE's 46% growth and the S&P 500's 18% gain.In a previous article, I highlighted the ways HP evolved its aging PC business while scaling up and diversifying its printing one. Today, we'll look at the key growth drivers for HP, and see why the 78-year-old company's best days could still be ahead.HP'S SPECTRE LAPTOP. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.1. PC declines have likely bottomedIn January, Gartner announced that worldwide PC shipments fell for the fifth consecutive year in 2016. That was sour news for PC vendors like HP, but Gartner expects sales to be nearly flat this year and rise in 2018 -- indicating that the market has finally bottomed out.That's because sales of premium ""ultramobile"" devices -- like Ultrabooks, Macbooks, and 2-in-1 devices -- are expected to rise and offset declines in ""traditional"" PCs like desktops and regular notebooks. HP's most recent quarterly report, which showed Personal Systems (PC) revenue rising 10% annually to $8.2 billion, reflected that shift -- desktop sales stayed flat, but notebook sales rose 16% on strong demand for higher-end convertibles, detachables, and thinner devices. Looking further ahead,the business could gain another tailwind from rising demand for VR-ready desktops and notebooks.2. It's scaling up its printing businessLast November, HP announced that it would acquire Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) printing business. That move will help HP use economies of scale to lower production costs, and is expected to become accretive in the first full year after the deal closes. HP also believes that combining the two companies' technologies will ""reinvent and replace service-intensive copies with superior multi-function printing.""HP's printing business didn't look great last quarter. Total printing revenues fell 3% annually to $4.5 billion, due to an 8% decline in commercial hardware (exacerbated by some products being shifted to the consumer business) and a 3% drop in supply sales. However, consumer hardware sales improved 2% -- thanks to healthy demand for its Sprocket mobile printer.HP'S SPROCKET MOBILE PRINTER. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.HP's commercial printing business could also perk up once it installs more high-end 3D printers for enterprise customers. It shipped its first Multi Jet Fusion printers to Jabil, Materialise, and Shapeways during the quarter, and CEO Dion Weisler noted during the conference call that HP was tracking that progress ""to disrupt the $12 trillion traditional manufacturing market."" Those new investments, along with the Samsung acquisition, could considerably strengthen HP's printing business over the next few years.3. It's all about the bundlesOne of HP's biggest advantages in the enterprise market is its ability to bundle products together at competitive prices. Last quarter, HP formed new partnerships with glass and ceramics maker Corning and pharmaceutical giant Roche, both of which now use ""comprehensive"" packages of HP's notebooks, desktops, and workstations. HP could eventually add 3D printers to those bundles for customers across the manufacturing industry.As enterprise spending warms up again, HP could sell more bundles to big enterprise customers -- which would strengthen both its PC and printing businesses.4. The stock is cheap, and the company rewards its shareholdersHP trades at 12 times earnings, which is well below its industry average of 20. It also trades at 0.6 times sales, which is also much lower than the industry average of 0.9. HP also pays a forward dividend yield of 3.1%, which is comfortably supported by a payout ratio of 33%. That combination of a stable business, low multiple, and high yield make HP very appealing in a market filled with overvalued dividend stocks.HP also clearly intends to return most of its free cash flow to shareholders. Last quarter, it generated over $700 million in FCF and spent more than $600 million on buybacks and dividends. Those moves can boost its earnings, keep valuations low, and attract additional income investors.The key takeawayThe ""new"" HP is definitely leaner and more focused than the old one, which included too many moving parts which frequently canceled out each others' gains. Therefore, I believe that HP's renewed efforts in the PC and printing markets could make it a great long-term play at current prices. The stock probably won't soar anytime soon, but its low valuations and solid dividend make it a sound investment for conservative investors."
3 Reasons HP Inc. is a Better Value Stock than Hewlett Packard Enterprise,"May 2, 2017 at 9:21AM","It might seem tough to find decent value plays in today's frothy market. However, the two halves of the company formerly known as Hewlett-Packard -- HP (NYSE:HPQ) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) -- both look like interesting value plays based on their low P/E ratios.HP trades at 12 times earnings, compared to its industry average of 20. HPE trades at 10 times earnings, which is much lower than its industry average of 30. Based on those figures, it might seem like HPE is a better value play. But if we examine both stocks more closely, we'll notice that three simple factors actually make HP a better value play than HPE.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.1. Faster growing core marketsAfter the two companies split in late 2015, HP retained the company's PC, printing, and imaging businesses, while HPE retained its enterprise hardware, software, and services. At the time, none of those markets looked appealing -- PC sales were stuck in a multi-year slump, printer sales were waning due to paperless workplaces and generic cartridges, and companies were spending less on enterprise hardware, services, and software solutions.However, the PC market started warming up again this year, supported by rising demand for premium laptops, convertibles, and other 2-in-1 devices. That's why HP's Personal Systems (PC) revenue rose 10% annually to $8.2 billion last quarter. HP's Printing sales still dipped 3% to $4.5 billion, but the company has been diversifying that business with mobile printers for smartphones and industrial 3D printers, and expanding its scale by acquiring Samsung's printing business.HP'S SPROCKET MOBILE PRINTER. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.HPE, however, is still slogging through the sluggish enterprise market. Last quarter, its Enterprise Group's revenue dropped 12% annually to $6.2 billion, its Enterprise Services revenue fell 11% to $4 billion, its Software revenue declined 8% to $721 million, and its Financial Services revenue slipped 6% to $823 million.HPE faces the same headwinds as its rival IBM (NYSE:IBM) -- weak enterprise spending, competition from nimbler rivals, and a market shift toward cloud-based solutions. Big Blue's 20 straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines indicates that this maligned market won't recover anytime soon.2. Better revenue and earnings growthBased on the differences between HP and HPE's core markets, it isn't surprising that Wall Street expects HP to post better top and bottom line growth over the next two years.Analysts expect HP's revenue to rise 1% this year and decline 1% next year as the PC market gradually bottoms out and the company alters its printing business. That growth isn't impressive, but it's much better than HPE's projected revenue declines of 28% this year and 17% next year. Last quarter, HPE attributed those declines to ""increased pressure from foreign exchange movements, higher commodities pricing, and some near-term execution issues.""IMAGE SOURCE: HPE.Both HP and HPE use buybacks to boost their earnings. Over the past 12 months, HP spent $702 million (19% of its free cash flow) on buybacks. HPE spent $1.83 billion on buybacks, which exceeded its free cash flow and was partly funded by debt. Analysts currently expect HP's earnings to rise 1% this year and 5% next year. Again, those numbers aren't great, but they're much better than HPE's projected earnings declines of 23% this year and 8% next year.HP's steady earnings growth enables it to pay a forward dividend yield of 2.8%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 33%. That's more than double HPE's forward yield of 1.4%, which is supported by a lower payout ratio of 13%.3. Fewer moving partsI generally like a company with fewer moving parts, because they're easier to understand. HP's core PC and Printer businesses are clear cut, and the market trends are easy to follow. HPE's business is more complex and murky, and CEO Meg Whitman seems to be channeling IBM by cutting jobs, divesting businesses, and performing complex spin-mergers to boost its bottom line growth.Prior to the split, HPE shuttered its public cloud service to focus on the less-competitive on-site and hybrid cloud markets. It then agreed to spin-off and merge its struggling IT services unit with Computer Science Corp. in an $8.5 billion deal, then agreed to spin-off of its ""non-core"" application delivery management, big data, and enterprise security businesses to Micro Focus International in another $8.8 billion deal. It then acquired smaller companies -- like supercomputer maker to SGI and hyperconverged infrastructure vendor SimpliVity -- to strengthen its hybrid cloud business. That's a lot of moving parts compared to HP's PC, printing, and imaging businesses.The key takeawayI'm not saying that HP is the ideal value stock for all investors -- its growth is anemic and it doesn't offer many compelling ways to grow in adjacent markets. But the company's recovering core markets, simpler business model, stable growth, and higher dividends all make it a much better value stock than HPE. "
Why Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Dropped Today,"Feb 24, 2017 at 3:53PM","What happenedShares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) slumped on Friday following the release of the company's fiscal first-quarter report. Revenue tumbled more than expected, and HPE slashed its full-year earnings guidance due to various headwinds. The stock was down 7.5% at 3 p.m. EST.So whatHPE reported first-quarter revenue of $11.4 billion, down 10% year over year and $670 million below the average analyst estimate. Excluding the effects of currency and divestitures, revenue declined by 4%. Enterprise group sales, which includes servers, storage, and networking, slumped 12% to $6.3 billion. Enterprise services sales dropped 11% to $4 billion, software sales fell 8% to $721 million, and financial services revenue rose 6% to $823 million.IMAGE SOURCE: HP ENTERPRISE.Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.45, up from $0.41 in the prior-year period and $0.01 higher than analysts were expecting. Non-GAAP net income excludes $505 million worth of charges related to separation costs, restructuring, and other items.HPE's outlook for fiscal 2017 got a haircut, with the company pointing to foreign exchange movements, higher commodities pricing, and near-term execution issues. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year is now expected in the range of $1.88 to $1.98, $0.12 below the company's previous outlook.Now whatHPE CEO Meg Whitman downplayed the company's problems: ""I believe HPE remains on the right track. The steps we're taking to strengthen our portfolio, streamline our organization, and build the right leadership team, are setting us up to win long into the future.""HPE is set to spin-off its enterprise services business, which will then merge with Computer Sciences Corp. What will remain following the spin-off -- primarily enterprise hardware like servers and storage -- didn't fare any better than the services segment during the first quarter. With revenue tumbling and guidance slashed, investors had plenty of good reasons to sell off the stock on Friday."
4 Things You Didn't Know About HP Inc.,"May 11, 2017 at 4:44PM","Investors are likely familiar with the basic history of HP (NYSE:HPQ), the seminal tech company founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a one-car garage in Palo Alto nearly eight decades ago. HP later evolved from a producer of electronic test equipment into the world's largest PC maker, a title which it held for about six years (2007-2013) before being overtaken by Chinese tech giant Lenovo.HP is widely considered the ""founder"" of Silicon Valley, but it hit many speed bumps in recent years. It changed CEOs three times within two years (2010-2011), pursued the disastrous acquisitions of Compaq, EDS, Palm, and Autonomy, and finally split into two companies -- with HP retaining the PC, printing, and imaging businesses, and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise retaining its enterprise hardware and software units.HP'S CURVED ALL-IN-ONE ENVY. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.But today, we'll focus on four lesser-known facts about HP which might change your perception about this aging tech giant.1. Apple might not exist without HPApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak both worked at HP. When Jobs was 12 years old, he wanted to build a frequency counter but lacked the proper components. Instead of asking his parents for help, Jobs looked up then-CEO Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him up.Hewlett was reportedly so impressed with Jobs' boldness that he gave him the parts and offered him a summer job on the assembly line. In a 1994 interview, Jobs said that ""most people don't get those experiences because they never ask.""A few summers later, Jobs was working at HP again when he met Wozniak, who was working on mainframe computers. Wozniak was reluctant to leave HP to start a new company, and even offered the design of the Apple I to HP five times -- but the idea was rejected each time. Therefore, it's safe to say that without HP bringing these two visionaries together and ultimately rejecting their ideas, today's tech industry might look very different.2. It's an environmentally friendly companyBack in 2006, HP and Apple were skewered by accusations that their laptops contained the highest levels of toxic chemicals among the world's leading PC makers. Those reports prompted both companies to clean up their acts over the following decade.In 2007, HP announced that it had achieved its three-year target of recycling one billion pounds of electronics, toner, and ink cartridges. The following year, it became the first PC maker to publicly release its supply chain emissions data.Those efforts helped it rank highly on Greenpeace's ""Guide to Greener Electronics"", which ranks companies every few years based on their efforts to reduce emissions, eliminate hazardous substances, recycle obsolete products, and halt the use of unsustainable materials in products and packaging.3. It killed off Palm two years earlyWhen HP bought Palm in 2010, it thought that it could turn around the struggling smartphone brand within three years to compete more effectively against Apple's iPhone and Android devices. The company's Pre smartphones were fairly well-received by reviewers, but consumers shunned them in favor of iOS and Android devices with expanding app ecosystems.Palm's WebOS might have evolved into a much larger ecosystem if HP had completed that three-year plan. Yet Leo Apotheker, who replaced Mark Hurd as CEO in late 2010, abruptly axed the entire project after a single year in 2011. That stunning move turned its newest TouchPad tablet into a fire sale product, dashed hopes for WebOS-powered PCs, and permanently left HP behind the mobile tech curve.4. It's been fighting with Oracle for the past six yearsHP sued Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) in 2011 after the company halted software development for the Intel Itanium processor used in HP's high-end enterprise servers.That decision was likely related to Oracle's decision to build its own SPARC-based servers. HP won the lawsuit in 2012, and Oracle was required to continue producing compatible software for Itanium-powered servers. Oracle was subsequently ordered to pay HPE, which inherited the legal battle after the split, a whopping $3 billion in damages.Oracle is currently appealing both the 2012 decision and the damages, so the animosity between these two companies won't fade anytime soon. But here's the ironic twist -- former HP CEO Mark Hurd, who resigned amid allegations of misconduct with an employee, is currently the co-CEO of Oracle.The road aheadToday's HP is a very different company from the one which Hewlett and Packard founded, the one where Jobs and Wozniak worked, and the one which kept tripping over its own feet with ousted CEOs and terrible acquisitions.Instead, it's a much more streamlined company that only sells PCs, printers, and imaging devices. And as I've stated before, this slimmed-down HP is definitely worth a closer look for value-seeking income investors.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is It Finally Time to Buy HP Inc. Stock?,"Mar 2, 2017 at 10:18AM","Shares of HP (NYSE:HPQ) jumped 9% on Feb. 23, after the PC and printer vendor posted a solid first quarter report. Revenue rose 4% annually to $12.7 billion, beating expectations by $850 million. Non-GAAP earnings grew 6% to $0.38 per share, topping estimates by a penny.That marked HP's second straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, and represented its best top line growth since it split from Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) in late 2015. Does that rebound indicate that it's finally safe to buy HP again? Let's take a closer look at the bull and bear cases to decide.HP'S ENVY CURVED ALL-IN-ONE PC. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.The bull case for HPWhen HP and HPE first split, it seemed like the former would be burdened by fading legacy businesses as the latter expanded into higher growth enterprise markets. PC shipments have declined for five straight years, according to Gartner, and printer sales growth remains anemic due to the longevity of existing hardware and the growing use of digital documents.That's why HP's growth in the first quarter was so surprising. Personal Systems (PC) revenue rose 10% annually to $8.2 billion, fueled by 7% growth from commercial customers and 15% growth from mainstream consumers. Desktop sales stayed flat, but notebook sales surged 16%. In comparison, HP's rival Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY) posted just 2% sales growth in its PC and tablets division last quarter. Gartner also notes that HP's market share grew from 18.8% to 20.4% between the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2016 -- and it remains the second biggest PC maker after Lenovo.During the conference call, CFO Catherine Lesjak attributed that growth to a better ""mix shift"" toward ""premium"" convertibles, detachables, and thinner devices with longer-lasting batteries. This was an encouraging reversal from the earlier notion that PCs had to become dirt cheap to counter Chromebooks. Looking further ahead, higher demand for ""VR ready"" PCs could also get its desktop growth back on track.HP'S HIGH-END SPECTRE LAPTOP. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.Last quarter, HP generated over $700 million in free cash flow and spent over $600 million on buybacks and dividends. Those moves keep HP's multiple low at 12 times earnings with a forward yield of 3% -- which is supported by a low payout ratio of 32%. Analyst expectations for the current year (1% sales growth and flat earnings growth) are also low that so upside surprises are more likely than downside ones.The bear case against HPHowever, HP's printer business remains weak. Total printing revenues dropped 3% annually to $4.5 billion, as 2% growth in consumer hardware failed to offset an 8% decline in commercial hardware and 3% drop in supply sales. HP believes that scaling up through its acquisition of Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) printing business could boost the unit's sales and margins after the deal closes in the second half of 2017. However, that move will also boost the weight of the sluggish printing business relative to Personal Systems -- which could eventually hurt HP's overall top line growth.HP also believes that sales of large format 3D printers for industrial customers will offset softer sales of traditional printers, but that market remains a small one compared to its core inkjet and laser products. New subscription services for supplies may boost its higher-margin revenues, but that strategy faces ongoing legal challenges from makers of generic cartridges.It's also tough for HP to sell commoditized products like PCs and printers overseas due to higher component costs and currency headwinds. During the conference call, Lesjak warned that HP had ""increased pricing globally in response to unfavorable currency movements and the increased cost of components, which could have a more significant impact on demand than we've assumed."" This indicates that the Personal Systems unit's operating margin of 3.8% could drift lower this year.Lastly, much of HP's earnings growth comes from layoffs and buybacks instead of gross margin expansion. Last October, HP announced that it slash up to 4,000 jobs (about 8% of its workforce) over the following three years to generate up to $300 million in annual savings by the beginning of fiscal 2020. Streamlining the business can be a wise move, but downsizing in the face of tough competition could also dull its competitive edge.The verdict: HP is a safe buySplitting with HPE initially seemed like a risky move, but HP has done a solid job evolving its aging PC business while scaling up and diversifying its printing one. HP isn't a sexy high-growth stock, but it's fundamentally cheap, has a respectable dividend, and is a market leader in the recovering PC market. I believe that those qualities make it a safe core holding for conservative income investors."
"Better Buy: Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co vs. Cisco Systems, Inc","Jan 4, 2017 at 12:06PM","Some of the biggest players in the ever-changing tech industry have been forced to reinvent themselves, or risk becoming obsolete. For networking king Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), change has meant a shift away from legacy, enterprise hardware to a focus on cloud infrastructure, data security, the Internet of Things (IoT), and communication solutions.If anything, HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) is undergoing even more changes than its cloud infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) brethren. Based on its more than 50% jump in value last year, most investors and pundits are on board with the ""new"" HP Enterprise. So, which is the better buy, HP Enterprise or Cisco?IMAGE SOURCE: CISCO.The case for CiscoIf there were any questions as to Cisco's commitment to transitioning to fast-growing new markets, those were laid to rest when it announced in August it would eliminate 5,500 jobs -- equal to about 7% of its global workforce -- to focus on its ""key priority areas."" Namely, the aforementioned cloud data centers, IoT, security, and collaboration offerings.Cisco is already making strides where it counts. Excluding its now divested SP Video business, Cisco's revenue climbed 1% to $12.35 billion compared to a year ago. After removing one-time items, per-share earnings improved 3% to $0.61. That may not appear overly impressive, but Cisco was able to grow sales and its bottom line despite a 7% decline in its old-school switching business.Though switching sales remain the top revenue driver, Cisco was able to make up for the unit's decline thanks to its strong 6% jump in routing revenue to $2.1 billion, due in large part to cloud-related offerings, and a whopping 11% year-over-year improvement in data security sales. Better still, particularly in the long run, Cisco's focus on building a recurring revenue model is hitting on all cylinders.Last quarter, subscription and software sales growth helped boost service revenue 7.5% to $3 billion. Service-related deferred revenue -- another measure of Cisco's recurring sales model -- grew to $10.4 billion, up 7.6% from a year ago. Not only do recurring sales provide a stable revenue source, it costs less to generate than new sales. Cisco's drop in expenses last quarter despite growing total revenue is a testament to that.IMAGE SOURCE: HP ENTERPRISE.The case for HP EnterpriseChanges are most certainly afoot with HP Enterprise. Not the least of which is its pending spinoff mergers. In keeping with CEO Meg Whitman's strategy of better positioning HP Enterprise to quickly adapt to new opportunities, it is merging its Enterprise Services unit with Computer Sciences Corp (NYSE:CSC), creating a ""$26 billion pure play IT services company.""The CSC news was followed by a similar move to spin off HP Enterprise's ""non-core software assets"" and merge them with U.K.-based Micro Focus (NASDAQOTH:MCFUF). Both deals are expected to close at the end of March.The result of the spinoffs, in addition to HP Enterprise becoming more nimble, includes ownership stakes of approximately 50% in each of the ""new"" companies for shareholders -- not to mention a tidy $2.5 billion cash payment to HP Enterprise, strengthening its already impressive balance sheet.Last quarter, HP Enterprise's cash and equivalents climbed over $3 billion compared to a year ago, to nearly $13 billion. Not only does its rock-solid balance sheet demonstrate HP Enterprise's financial stability, it also positions it to target niche acquisitions to fill any gaps in its suite of solutions. The recent $275 million deal for big data analytics and high-performance computing provider SGI is a recent example.Which is the better buy?Even after its banner 2016, HP Enterprise stock is trading at a mere 11 times future earnings, making it one of the best values in its sector. Cisco is trading at just 12 times forward earnings, and with its nearly 3.5% dividend yield and future prospects, it's the better buy for growth and income investors.That said, when the smoke clears, HP Enterprise will be ideally positioned to grow by leaps and bounds as 2017 progresses -- and beyond. For investors in search of pure growth potential, HP Enterprise gets the nod. 10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

4 Reasons to Buy HP Inc. Stock in 2017,"Jan 5, 2017 at 5:09PM","After the stock price climbed nearly 30% in value last year, some investors may think HP's (NYSE:HPQ) upside in 2017 is limited. Pundits seem to think so, as they did for much of last year. In addition, the consensus analyst price target is $16.10 a share -- all of 6% above HP's current stock price -- which amounts to a hold rating.But before removing HP from a list of stocks to buy in 2017, there are several reasons why this year could prove to be every bit as strong as 2016. That's especially true for growth and income investors, in light of the fact that HP's dividend yield is near the top of the tech heap. But there are three other reasons HP should deliver on the growth side of the equation as well.IMAGE SOURCE: HP.King of the hillWith each successive quarterly global PC sales report, the headlines inevitably go something like this: ""PC Sales Nosedive. Again."" The thing is, while the global PC market is declining, HP sales are booming. Last quarter, personal systems -- home to HP's PC sales -- generated $8 billion in revenue, up 4% year over year and 7% sequentially.Each segment within the unit improved, led by a 6% jump in notebook sales. Because of these strong results, HP is within striking distance of unseating Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY) as the top PC seller on the planet. In 2016's third quarter, HP held a 20.4% market share, up from 18.8% the prior year. Lenovo? Though its piece of the PC pie got larger, the increase was nominal, with its market share climbing to 20.9% from 20.2%. By the time year-end sales results are released, HP could find itself looking down on all PC manufacturers, including Lenovo.When cheap is goodAfter HP's stellar 2016 run, it would be logical to assume the stock is priced fairly high. The good news for investors in search of value is that nothing could be further from the truth. At just 10 times trailing earnings, HP is one of the least expensive stocks in tech. HP shares are trading at a mere nine times earnings expectations.And it gets better.HP shaved nearly $3 billion in expenses last fiscal year, and if not for a $816 million tax benefit in 2015's fourth quarter, combined with a nearly $500 million tax-provision hit last quarter, HP would have increased net earnings from operations to $1 billion, compared with $699 million the prior year after the tax adjustment. Revenue was flat in the fourth quarter, but HP is growing its bottom line.What about printing?HP's printing unit sales declined 8% last quarter, dragged down by a 12% drop in supply sales, which is handily the division's largest segment. That can't be good, right? Actually, last quarter HP took a significant step in the right direction in remedying its printing woes. In the company's 2016 third quarter, total print sales were down 14%, led by a whopping 18% nosedive in supply sales. But help is on the way.HP's $1.05 billion deal for Samsung's (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) print unit is set to close this summer, which should really make things interesting. In addition to ""more than 6,500"" patents and cutting-edge technology, the acquisition of Samsung's printing division includes a supply segment, which should give HP a significant boost where it counts. There's also 3D printing -- a market poised to skyrocket -- and HP's newish Jet Fusion lineup could give existing players a real run for their money.Show me the moneyIn addition to being one of the least expensive stocks in its sector, HP also pays one of the highest dividends. At 3.5%, HP's yield isn't the highest, but it's bumping up against the top dividends around. With cash and equivalents of $6.29 billion, and a long, stable history of paying its shareholders, HP's dividend should be safe for years to come.Thanks to its industry-leading dividend, its position as the soon-to-be top PC manufacturer, an improving printing unit, and shares that are ridiculously cheap, HP stock is a buy for most any growth and income investor in 2017."
How HP Inc. Stock Gained 15% in February,"Mar 9, 2017 at 6:38PM","What happenedShares of HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) rose 15.4% in February 2017, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.So whatThe big jump came late in the month. HP reported first-quarter 2017 results on Feb. 22, leaving Wall Street's estimates far behind despite modest revenue growth and flat earnings. Investors chose to ignore a gloomy slate of second-quarter guidance targets, and share prices soared as much as 10% higher the next day.IS IT A TABLET? IS IT A LAPTOP? THE HP ELITEBOOK X360 IS ACTUALLY BOTH. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.Now whatThe consumer-friendly half of the old Hewlett-Packard empire sure fared better than its business computing cousin in this round of business updates. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) reported its own results later that week -- and that stock promptly fell 9.4% on the news.The biggest surprise in these diverging paths is that HP Inc.'s strong results did not come from its semi-corporate printing division. Instead, they rested on solid sales of consumer-grade PC systems. In particular, notebook sales are booming these days, even if the PC market was supposed to have died years ago.That being said, both HP Inc. and HP Enterprise have rewarded their investors generously since going their separate ways, with both stocks rising more than 45% over the last year. Still, they trade at very reasonable price-to-earnings ratios and could easily move even higher. The two halves of Hewlett-Packard may indeed be greater separately than the sum of the parts ever were together.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: HP Inc. vs. International Business Machines Corp.,"Apr 27, 2017 at 5:46PM","HP (NYSE:HPQ) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) are often considered mature tech plays that are owned for stability and income instead of growth. However, shares of HP have surged nearly 50% over the past 12 months, easily crushing the S&P 500's 14% gain and IBM's 8% growth during the same period. Let's discuss why HP flourished as IBM floundered, and whether or not both stocks will continue on their current trajectories this year.How HP and IBM evolvedHP and IBM have both evolved significantly over the past few years. HP split with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) in late 2015. After that split, HP retained the company's PC, printing, and imaging businesses, while HPE retained the enterprise hardware and software units. The PC and printing markets seem like slow-growth ones, but HP is carving out new niches in both markets with premium laptops, 2-in-1 devices, mobile printers, and industrial 3D printers.HP'S CURVED ALL-IN-ONE ENVY. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.IBM has shrunk itself by divesting many of its non-core assets. It sold its PC and x86 server businesses to Lenovo, paid GlobalFoundries to take over its chip manufacturing business, and divested other lower-margin businesses. It then invested its cash into its five higher-growth ""strategic imperatives"" of cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security-related businesses. Big Blue's core strategy is to grow those five businesses fast enough to offset ongoing declines at its aging IT services, hardware, and software businesses.How fast are HP and IBM growing?HP and IBM are both slow-growth companies. HP's revenue fell 6% to $48.2 billion last year, but analysts expect 1% growth this year. That slight recovery is attributed to warming sales of PCs, which boosted its Personal Systems (PC) revenues by 10% annually to $8.2 billion during the first quarter. That growth was mainly supported by rising demand for its premium convertibles, detachables, and thinner devices with longer-lasting batteries.HP's printing revenue fell 3% annually to $4.5 billion during the quarter, due to weak growth in commercial hardware and supply sales. However, HP also noted that sales of its mobile printers (for smartphones) were robust, that big enterprise customers were placing orders for its new 3D printers, and that its planned takeover of Samsung's printing business would enable the business to scale up.IBM's revenue has declined annually for 20 consecutive quarters, indicating that the growth of its strategic imperatives still isn't offsetting declines in its older businesses, which are weighed down by sluggish enterprise spending and competition from nimbler rivals. Big Blue's total revenues dropped 2% annually to $79.9 billion last year, and analysts anticipate another 2% decline this year.IBM'S WATSON BEING USED ON MOBILE DEVICES. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Last quarter, IBM's strategic imperatives revenue rose 12% annually to $7.8 billion and accounted for 42% of its revenue over the past 12 months. But that growth still didn't prevent its total revenue from dropping 3% to $18.2 billion for the quarter. The only bright spot was that its Cognitive Solutions revenue -- which includes its closely watched Watson and cloud AI businesses -- rose by 2%. Meanwhile, revenue at all of its other main business segments (business services, technology services and cloud platforms, systems, and global financing) declined year-over-year.Profitability, dividends, and valuationsHP and IBM both use buybacks to boost their earnings. HP spent $702 million, or 19% of its free cash flow (FCF), on buybacks over the past 12 months. IBM spent $3.68 billion, or 32% of its FCF, on buybacks during the same period.That's how HP grew its non-GAAP earnings by 10% in fiscal 2016. But looking ahead, analysts expect that figure to rise less than 1% this year and about 5% next year. IBM's non-GAAP earnings fell 9% in fiscal 2016 (due to a gradual decline in buybacks), and analysts anticipate less than 1% growth this year and 2% growth next year.Both companies have plenty of cash to fund their dividends. HP pays a forward yield of 2.9%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 33%. IBM pays a forward yield of 3.5%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 44%. Those low payout ratios indicate that both companies have plenty of room to raise their dividends.HP trades at just 12 times earnings, which is much lower than its industry average of 20. IBM trades at 13 times earnings, which is also a discount to its industry average of 19. However, HP's price-to-sales ratio of 0.7 is significantly lower than IBM's P/S ratio of 1.9.The winner: HPIt's a close call, but a simpler business model, a recovering PC market, and an evolving printing business all make HP a better buy than IBM at current prices. IBM offers a better dividend, but its strategy of growing its strategic imperatives to offset slowdowns at its other aging businesses simply isn't paying off yet.  "
Better Dividend Stock: HP Inc. or Lenovo Group Limited (ADR)?,"Apr 1, 2017 at 12:05PM","Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY) and HP (NYSE:HPQ) are the two largest PC makers in the world. Lenovo controlled 20.7% of the world's PC market in 2016, according to Gartner, up from 19.9% in 2015. HP's share grew from 18.3% to 19.4% during that period.Lenovo and HP are often mentioned in the same breath, but the two companies have very different models for business and dividend payments. Let's take a closer look at Lenovo and HP's businesses to see which company is a better play for income investors.LENOVO'S YOGA 910 LAPTOP. IMAGE SOURCE: LENOVO.How are Lenovo and HP different?Lenovo's business is mainly built on acquisitions. It acquired IBM's PC business and x86 server businesses, which became the foundations of its PC and Data Center businesses. It bought Motorola Mobility from Alphabet's Google in 2014, which boosted the weight of its Mobile business.HP'S CURVED ENVY ALL-IN-ONE PC. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.Meanwhile, HP slimmed down by splitting with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise in late 2015. HP retained the PC, printing, and imaging businesses, and HPE kept the enterprise hardware and software divisions. Most of HP's sales come from PCs, and the rest comes from printers and imaging services.  Lenovo's key opportunitiesLast quarter, 70% of Lenovo's revenue came from its PCSD (PC and Smart Devices) division -- which sells of PCs, laptops, 2-in-1s, convertible devices, and tablets. 18% came from its Mobile business, which sells Lenovo and Motorola smartphones, and 9% came from its Data Center business.Its PCSD revenue rose 2% annually during the quarter, thanks to rebounding demand for high-end laptops and 2-in-1 devices, but its Mobile and Data Center revenues respectively fell 23% and 20%. That weakness -- which caused its total revenues to fall 6% -- was caused by tough competition in the Chinese smartphone market and sluggish enterprise spending on low-end servers.To address that slowdown, Lenovo is expanding its mobile business to higher growth markets like India. To strengthen its data center business, Lenovo is revamping its product line, expanding its sales teams, and forging new enterprise partnerships.HP's key opportunities65% of HP's revenue came from PC sales last quarter, and the rest came from printers and imaging services. Its PC sales rose 10% annually, thanks to rising demand for higher-end laptops and convertibles, but printer sales dipped 3% due to lower demand for commercial hardware and supplies. Despite that hiccup, HP's total sales still rose 4%.Looking ahead, HP's PC sales will likely keep improving on more user upgrades. As for the printing business, HP believes that new product like mobile device printers (like the Sprocket) and industrial-class 3D printers will get its growth back on track. Its planned acquisition of Samsung's printing unit should also help the business scale up and boost its overall market share.Which company pays higher dividends?At first glance, Lenovo's trailing yield of 5.2% looks much better than HP's 3% yield. However, Lenovo's yield was lifted to an all-time high by the stock's 17% decline over the past year.SOURCE: YCHARTSLike many Chinese companies, Lenovo pays semi-annual dividends which are declared every half year. Lenovo has only paid dividends since 2014, and it only raised its payout once in 2015. The dividend, which is paid in Hong Kong dollars, could also fluctuate based on exchange rates for ADR shareholders in the U.S. HP already hiked its quarterly dividend once last year, and will likely continue the ""old"" HP's tradition of annual dividend hikes.Lenovo spent 47% of its earnings and 75% of its free cash flow (FCF) on dividends over the past 12 months. HP spent just 33% of its earnings and 23% of its FCF on its dividends. HP's lower payout ratios indicate that it has more room to raise its dividend, but Lenovo probably won't slash its payout anytime soon.Which stock is the cheaper play?Lenovo and HP both belong to the diversified computer systems industry, which has an average P/E of 13. Lenovo and HP both trade at 12 times trailing earnings. However, Lenovo's price-to-sales ratio of 0.2 is much lower than HP's P/S ratio of 0.6.Analysts expect Lenovo's revenue to fall 4% this year before rebounding 3% next year. HP's revenue is expected to rise 1% this year and dip 1% next year. That sluggish growth can be attributed to the gradual recovery of PC sales -- fueled by demand for premium laptops, convertibles, and 2-in-1s -- being offset by slower growth in other businesses, like Lenovo's Mobile and Data Center businesses and HP's printing business.On the bottom line, Lenovo posted a net loss in fiscal 2016, but it's expected to return to full-year profitability this year, which ends on March 31. Its earnings are expected to stay roughly flat in 2018. HP's earnings are expected to rise less than 1% this year, but grow 4% next year on stronger sales of PCs and the aforementioned changes to its printing business.The winner: HPLenovo might have the higher yield, but its poor price performance, exposure to the saturated mobile and data center markets, higher payout ratios, and inconsistent dividend hikes all make it a less desirable income play than HP. HP has a lower yield, but its balanced growth and predictable dividend hikes make it a better overall pick in my book.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why HP Inc Stock Jumped 10% on Thursday,"Feb 23, 2017 at 3:16PM","What happenedHP (NYSE:HPQ) stock -- formerly known as Hewlett-Packard -- rose as much as 9.9% in early Thursday trading before settling down to enjoy a more recent gain of 8.7% as of 2:30 p.m. EST.So whatThis being earnings season, you might expect that earnings had something to do with HP's rise -- and you'd be right. HP reported its fiscal Q1 2017 earnings yesterday after close of trading.Earnings of $0.36 per share on revenue of $12.7 billion beat Wall Street estimates on both fronts. This probably explains why the stock is responding so strongly. Compared to the year-ago results, profits were flat, and operating profit margins declined 90 basis points, to 6.7%. On the other hand, at least revenues rose -- 4% year over year.INVESTORS SEE REASON TO CHEER IN HP'S EARNINGS. BUT WHAT DO YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN? IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Now whatTurning its gaze forward, however, HP predicted that the second fiscal quarter of 2017 will see profits turn back down, to perhaps as low as $0.32 to $0.35 per share. This guidance range would appear to fall short of Wall Street expectations for $0.39 per share in Q2. What's more, HP's entire guidance range fell below the $0.36 per share that the company earned in last year's Q2.That's not particularly good news, yet investors appear to be shrugging it off in light of the ""earnings beat"" HP achieved in Q1. (Or they may be assuming HP is lowballing its estimates again, and hoping for a repeat beat).Either way, at a P/E (price-to-earnings ratio) multiple of only 11 times trailing earnings, HP stock certainly doesn't seem expensive today. Up 9% on Thursday, it shouldn't take much more good news to make it go up more.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Top Dividend Stocks in the Server Industry,"Apr 8, 2017 at 4:31PM","Servers are, in many respects, the backbones of technology industry. They serve as critical infrastructure on which a host of other functions rest. Considering their importance, it should come as no surprise that the server market is one of the largest sub-industries in all of tech; global server sales totaled $14.6 billion in Q4 2016, according to research firm IDC. Cloud computing is undoubtedly changing the industry, but the leading server manufacturers remain several well-known tech companies. In this article, we'll look at three dividend-paying, large-cap stocks that investors interested in the server market should consider.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Hewlett-Packard EnterpriseIt is the world's largest server provider, and servers sales constitute the single-largest revenue contributor among Hewlett-Packard Enterprises' (NYSE:HPE) six reporting sub-sections, accounting for $14.0 billion of the IT giant's $50.1 billion FY 2016 sales. Like the rest of the market, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's server sales have remained fairly static, declining just 0.7% from 2015 to 2016.For those unfamiliar with it, the company was formed from the 2015 split of the iconic tech conglomerate Hewlett-Packard. HP Inc. was created to house the PC and printer division, which remain in secular decline, while Hewlett-Packard Enterprise was created to hold the more promising businesses. However, looking at current analyst estimates, it isn't immediately clear that those businesses are, in fact, more promising.Wall Street analysts see the company's 2017 estimated sales falling 28% and its FY 2018 revenue declining a further 17%. Interestingly, this kind of sales attrition did not reveal itself in HPE's most recent 10-K filing; FY 2016 total revenues fell a mere 3.8%. As such, investors considering buying HPE for its income-producing abilities should keep in mind that many observers widely expect its business to gradually deteriorate in the coming years. Buyer beware.In terms of its dividend stats, HPE yields slightly less than the market average of 1.94%. The company raised its dividend in December, so its shares yield 1.28% on a trailing-12-month rate basis, and 1.48% on a forward basis. It also enjoys plenty of room for future rate increases -- HPE's payout ratio sits at just 12.6% -- though its revenue growth outlook profile remains a critical consideration for anyone looking at HPE stock.International Business MachinesUnlike HPE, the dynamics at International Business Machines' (NYSE:IBM) server business better reflect the on-the-ground reality of the server industry. IBM organizes its sales of its three main server products under the umbrella of its Systems reporting segment. For its fiscal 2016, sales of IBM's physical servers plummeted 21.8% to $5.9 billion. This might seem dire, but it's important to remember that cloud computing and IBM's various software-as-a-service offerings still rely on servers to power their systems. In fact, IBM's cloud revenues grew 49% in 2016 to a run rate of $5.8 billion, or roughly the same size as IBM's current server sales base. Said another way, IBM's shifting business model hasn't eroded the server as a key driver of its sales. Rather, the rise of cloud computing means IBM is selling server-powered software to customers, rather than physical servers themselves.In terms of its dividend payments, IBM shares currently yield 3.2%, well above market averages. The company has done an admirable of job steadily increasing its payouts as well. Though not a Dividend Aristocrat, IBM has increased its annual cash payments for 17 consecutive years. It also bears noting that IBM has been one of the most active companies in corporate America in terms of rewarding its shareholders through stock buybacks as well. So, while IBM doesn't command the same kind of server market share as HPE, the company's continued progress in its ongoing business pivot and above-average yield make it one of the more appealing income-producing stocks to appear on this list.IntelAnother interesting dividend play tied to the server industry could be investing in one of the suppliers that provides hardware components to the industry at large. If that's your flavor, then chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is perhaps your best bet.Intel is widely acknowledged to control an estimated 99% of the server microprocessor market, making it a proxy for the industry as a whole. As such, companies that make and sell physical servers to customers, like HPQ and IBM, use Intel chips to power their products. However, major cloud computing providers -- like Amazon, Alphabet, and others -- also use Intel server chips to power their respective cloud infrastructures. As such, investing in Intel can be seen as a nice way to invest in the industry growth as a whole, while saving the headache of having to determine which specific server manufacturer will perform the best.Seasoned tech investors will also recognize Intel as one of the industry's best-known dividend stocks. Though fairly mature from a sales growth perspective, Intel handsomely rewards its shareholders through cash distributions and stock buybacks. Intel's current dividend yield sits at a respectable 2.9%. Its 49% payout ratio should give the company the flexibility to continue to raise payouts in the future as well. And while not a Dividend Aristocrat -- Intel missed raising its dividend as recently as two years ago -- the company has demonstrated a general commitment to growing its dividend. As just one example, Intel's cash distributions grew from just $0.07 in its FY 2000 to $1.04 in its FY 2016. So, while Intel doesn't directly produce servers, its shares can still be an interesting way for investors to generate dividend payments from the server industry all the same.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Top Information Technology Stocks to Buy in 2017,"Jun 1, 2017 at 10:26AM","Information technology has been a hot topic for decades. The industry has helped many investors build successful retirement portfolios, and will create lots of wealth in the future, too.That being said, it's also a risky sector where investors can walk into a value trap at every turn. It's important to separate the dry chaff from the golden wheat in this market, metaphorically speaking.I'm here to point you in the right direction, with three top information technology stocks offering more rewards than risk right now. Read on to see how Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) can live up to that promise, each in its own particular way.IMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET.A fleet-footed giantToday, you know Alphabet as the parent company of internet search and advertising giant Google. Under that consumer-friendly brand, the company also runs many services aimed directly at corporate customers. Online advertising is the prime example of this, followed by cloud-computing services and advanced machine learning tools.The Google umbrella covers 99% of Alphabet's revenue today, but that's going to change in the long run. Without the ""Other Bets"" division, there would be no need to wrap the successful Google business in the Alphabet structure. That segment is working on new ideas in fields as diverse as medical research, self-driving cars, and high-speed connectivity services.Come back in 10 years, and chances are that the Alphabet you see will look very different from the online titan you're used to. Alphabet aims to become a cross-sector conglomerate, a sprawling set of loosely connected products and services, where data-driven research is the common denominator that ties the whole group together.That's a winning strategy in the long run. The conglomerate idea frees Alphabet to start from the solid platform of cash and technology that Google built, and then point it in new directions as circumstances allow. Alphabet carries the second-largest market cap on the planet, but still has lots of room for growth over decades to come.I'm in for the long run, and would also be very comfortable with buying Alphabet shares in 2017.A leaner, meaner enterprise computing specialistYou can think of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as the business-oriented side of the old Hewlett-Packard empire. The enterprise segment was spun out as a separate business in 2015, leaving HP Inc. to manage consumer products and printers. The two companies are still intertwined in many ways and could stand to put more space between them, but at least investors have the opportunity to focus on one specific aspect of the predecessor company's sprawling operations.From that starting point, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has moved on to refine its strategic plan and double down on profitable growth opportunities within its wheelhouse.The company spun out its low-margin enterprise services operations to merge with Computer Sciences Corporation, creating a new business entity known as DXC Technology. The cratering sales of the software division soon followed, moving out to U.K.-based sector peer Micro Focus in a deal worth $8.8 billion. A leaner, meaner company then turned around to acquire flash-based storage specialist Nimble Storage for $1 billion.The revamped Hewlett Packard Enterprise is a nearly pure play on enterprise services with a small side of financing operations. The company focuses on enterprise-class storage solutions, big-iron server systems, and the consulting services needed to run an HP-powered data center.Going forward, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is trading in nearly half of its annual revenue for a clearer business focus and much wider profit margins. You can buy into this evolving business at bargain-basement prices, coupled with a reasonably generous dividend policy. This is a low-risk pick in the information technology sector now that the corporate makeover has been completed, ideal for investors with little patience for volatility and surprises along the way.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Diving deeper into security servicesAkamai Technologies runs a global network of content delivery services, based on specialized caching servers installed in connection hubs and data centers around the world. These caches used to speed up downloads of large files such as high-resolution graphics and digital video, and media customers accounted for the lion's share of Akamai's sales.As of 2017, the company is letting smaller rival Limelight Networks take much of the media traffic that used to mean so much, giving Limelight a new lease on life while Akamai turns toward the more profitable security market.The same caching servers can also serve as an effective cure for distributed denial of service (or DDoS) attacks.""Enterprises need solutions capable of defending against massive botnets that are exploiting millions of online devices,"" said Akamai CEO Tom Leighton in November 2016. ""This is an area where Akamai's unique architecture and ongoing investments in global scale and security innovation continue to make a critical difference.""Akamai's cloud security sales skyrocketed 44% higher in 2016, showing no signs of slowing down in 2017. Media delivery revenue dropped 10% lower, but the company seems to be comfortable with its new calling. Investors have yet to be convinced, driving share prices 30% lower in the first five months of 2017 while Limelight's investors enjoyed a 15% gain.But Akamai strikes a profit without breaking a sweat, and the security-focused future looks bright."
The 3 Best Dividend Stocks in Computers,"Mar 29, 2017 at 9:41PM","A few years ago, analysts claimed that PCs would be rendered obsolete by waves of new mobile devices. While shipments of PCs have indeed fallen for five straight years, according to Gartner, demand for PCs recently warmed up as new premium and 2-in-1 devices entered the market.Within this market, you probably won't find companies with double-digit sales or earnings growth. Instead, you'll find mature tech stocks that trade at reasonable valuations and pay decent dividends. Let's take a look at three good income plays in this market -- Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.LenovoChinese tech giant Lenovo is the biggest PC maker in the world. Its global market share grew from 19.9% to 21.7% between 2015 and 2016, according to Gartner. Last quarter, 70% of Lenovo's revenue came from its PCSD (PC and Smart Devices) business, which consists of PCs, laptops, 2-in-1s, convertibles, and tablets. 18% came from its Mobile Business, and 9% came from the Data Center business.The PCSD unit posted 2% annual sales growth last quarter, but that didn't offset declines at both the Mobile and Data Center segments, which caused its total revenue to fall 6%. Analysts believe that Lenovo's revenue will fall 4% this year, but it should still generate a narrow profit, compared to a net loss in fiscal 2016.Lenovo has a trailing yield of 5.2%, but that yield is currently at a multi-year high due to the stock's 24% decline over the past five years. It only pays two dividends annually -- a higher interim dividend in the middle of the year and a lower final dividend at the end. Lenovo started paying those dividends in 2014, and only raised the interim dividend once in 2015. Lenovo doesn't follow specific rules regarding dividend payments, but its trailing payout ratio of 47% indicates that it can easily support its current yield. The stock also trades at just 12 times earnings, which is slightly lower than its industry average of 13.Hewlett-PackardHewlett-Packard is the second biggest PC maker in the world. Gartner reports that its market share rose from 18.3% to 19.4% between 2015 and 2016. Last quarter, 65% of HP's revenue came from PC sales, and the rest came from sales of printers and imaging devices. HP's PC sales rose 10% annually during the quarter, thanks to rising demand for premium, convertible, and 2-in-1 devices, but printer sales declined.HP'S CURVED ENVY ALL-IN-ONE PC. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.Wall Street expects HP's sales and earnings to stay nearly flat this year. However, the recovery of the PC market and the growth of its printer business -- boosted by new products like mobile and industrial 3D printers, as well as its planned acquisition of Samsung's printing business -- should eventually help it return to growth over the next few years.HP pays a forward yield of 3.1%, which is easily supported by its payout ratio of 33%. The company notably generated over $700 million in free cash flow last quarter, but spent more than $600 million on buybacks and dividends. HP is also fairly cheap at 12 times earnings.AppleApple is the fifth largest PC maker in the world, but Gartner reports that its market share slipped from 7.1% in 2015 to 6.9% in 2016. Mac sales fell year-over-year for several straight quarters, but sales and shipments finally rebounded during the first quarter on its refreshed MacBook Pros.APPLE'S NEW MACBOOK PRO. IMAGE SOURCE: APPLE.Mac sales rose 7% annually during that quarter and accounted for 9% of its top line. 69% still came from the iPhone, 7% came from the iPad, and the rest came from Services and other products. Analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to respectively grow 6% and 8% this year as iPhone sales rise and services like Apple Pay and Apple Music grow.Apple pays a forward yield of 1.6%. That might seem paltry, but its payout ratio of 27% indicates that the company could easily double its dividend in the future. Apple has also hiked that dividend every year since reintroducing it in 2012. Apple's P/E of 17 makes it a pricier play than Lenovo or HP, but that premium is justified by its higher growth rates.The key takeawaysLenovo, HP, and Apple should all benefit from growing demand for PCs, but investors should also note each company's flaws. Lenovo is too heavily exposed to the saturated smartphone market, the recovery of HP's printing business is still speculative, and Apple still relies too much on the iPhone. But for investors who want fairly cheap stocks with decent dividends, these three computer stocks might just fit the bill.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

4 Tech Stocks to Buy with Dividends Yielding More than 3%,"Apr 2, 2017 at 11:07AM","With the S&P 500 hovering near a historic high, the index's average dividend yield has dipped below 2%. Meanwhile, low interest rates and global uncertainties caused many income investors to buy blue chip dividend stocks, which boosted their valuations and lowered their yields.Those factors turned many well-known income stocks into shaky investments. However, four stocks with solid yields over 3% and below-average valuations could still be good income plays at their current prices -- Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), IBM (NYSE:IBM), HP (NYSE:HPQ), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Cisco SystemsCisco is one of the largest networking hardware companies in the world. Its core business of switches and routers is a slow growth one, but the company has been investing heavily in higher growth businesses like collaboration software, wireless products, and cybersecurity services.On the surface, its growth looks glacial, with analysts expecting revenue to fall 2% this year and earnings to grow less than 1%. However, Cisco has plenty of free cash flow ($12.3 billion over the past 12 months) to keep making strategic acquisitions, buying back stock, and paying dividends. Cisco currently pays a forward dividend yield of 3.4%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 54%. It's raised that dividend annually for six straight years. The stock trades at 18 times earnings, which is lower than its industry average of 25.IBMIBM is a much leaner company today than it was in previous years. The company sold its PC business and x86 server businesses to Lenovo, paid Globalfoundries to take its chipmaking business, divested other slower-growth businesses, and slashed thousands of jobs. To spur growth again, it invested heavily in its five higher-growth ""strategic imperatives"" -- cloud, mobile, social, analytics, and security.IBM CEO GINNI ROMETTY. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Like Cisco, IBM is trying to grow those businesses fast enough to offset ongoing declines at its slower growth hardware, software, and IT services units. That hasn't worked so far -- analysts expect Big Blue's revenue to fall 2% this year, but its earnings (lifted by lower expenses and buybacks) could grow 2%. IBM currently pays a forward yield of 3.2%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 44%. That dividend has been raised annually for 17 straight years. The stock trades at 14 times earnings, which is lower than its industry average of 21.Hewlett-PackardHewlett-Packard also slimmed down in late 2015 by splitting with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. HP retained the company's PC, printing, and imaging businesses, and HPE kept the enterprise hardware and software ones.HP's PC and printing markets have both been slow-growth ones, but its PC sales rebounded sharply last quarter as higher-end laptops, 2-in-1s, and convertible devices offset flat sales of desktops. Printer sales still dipped year-over-year, but new initiatives like mobile printers, industrial 3D printers, and its takeover of Samsung's printing business could all get the business back on track.Analysts expect HP's revenue and earnings to each rise less than 1% this year, but the stock remains cheap at 12 times earnings -- which is lower than its industry average of 13. It pays a forward yield of 3.1%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 33%.QualcommQualcomm is the biggest mobile chipmaker in the world. It generates most of its revenue from mobile chip sales, but most of its profits come from its high-margin patent licensing business for 3G/4G wireless technologies. Both business units face tough headwinds -- cheaper ARM-based chipmakers and first-party chipmakers are denting its chipmaking revenues, while defiant OEMs and regulators want Qualcomm to lower its licensing fees.IMAGE SOURCE: QUALCOMM.Despite those challenges, Wall Street expects Qualcomm's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 1% and 5% this year, fueled by sales of new Snapdragon chips and its investments in adjacent markets.Its planned acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, which still needs to clear regulatory approval, would boost its annual revenues by nearly 40% and make it the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world.Qualcomm pays a forward yield of 3.7%, has a payout ratio of 63%, and has raised that dividend annually for 14 straight years. The stock trades at 17 times earnings, which is lower than its industry average of 22.The key takeawaysCisco, IBM, HP, and Qualcomm all pay solid dividends and trade at discounts to their industry peers. That makes them good income picks, but investors should realize that their upside potential could be limited by the near-term headwinds.Cisco and IBM are both trying to grow newer businesses fast enough to offset slowdowns at their older ones. HP is pivoting its PC business away from desktops while diversifying and scaling up its printing unit. Qualcomm is trying to diversify its chipmaking business away from mobile devices, defend its licensing practices against regulators, and close the NXP deal. This means that all four companies will keep paying dependable dividends, but investors shouldn't expect their stocks to rally sharply anytime soon.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2 Rock Solid Cheap Stocks with P/Es Under 15,"Feb 13, 2017 at 10:30AM","With the market hovering near all-time highs, it might seem tough to find ""cheap"" stocks that are still worth buying. But with the S&P 500's P/E ratio currently near a multi-year high of 24, investors should focus on undervalued stocks with less room to fall. Let's take a closer look at two big tech names that have P/E ratios of 15 or less -- Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE).Cisco SystemsCisco is one of the world's largest vendors of networking hardware and software. Its core businesses of routers and switches are slow growth -- sales of routers fell 4% in fiscal 2016, while sales of switches stayed flat. Those two businesses accounted for nearly half of its top line during the year.IMAGE SOURCE: CISCO.Both businesses face two major headwinds -- the rise of cheaper rivals like Huawei, and companies like Arista Networks, which specializes in hardware for SDN (software-defined networking) solutions. SDN (or cloud networking) platforms reduce the need for on-site hardware like routers and switches.However, Cisco is diversifying away from those businesses with increased investments in higher-growth businesses like cybersecurity, collaboration, and service provider video solutions -- which it can bundle with its networking hardware. It also expanded its presence in the Internet of Things (IoT) market with its acquisition of Jasper Technologies, and will strengthen its networkwide app analytics capabilities with its planned purchase of AppDynamics.Cisco plans to use its robust free cash flow ($12.4 billion over the past 12 months) to buy more companies, boost its earnings with buybacks, and pay out dividends. On the surface, Cisco's growth looks glacial, with analysts expecting a 2% sales decline and nearly flat earnings growth this year. But Cisco's P/E of 15 is also much lower than its industry average of 25, and its forward dividend yield of 3.3% easily beats the S&P 500's average yield of 2% -- making it a good conservative income play for 2017.Hewlett-Packard EnterpriseHewlett-Packard Enterprise retained HP's enterprise hardware and software businesses after splitting with the PC, printer, and imaging businesses. But like many of its industry peers, HPE has struggled to grow its top line amid sluggish enterprise spending, macroeconomic issues, currency headwinds, and rising competition from smaller rivals. Analysts expect HPE's revenue to dip 2% this year and remain flat next year.HPE's CEO is Meg Whitman, who previously led both halves of HP. Whitman's core strategy has been to streamline the enterprise business with divestments, spinoffs, and layoffs. Prior to the big split, HP exited the highly competitive public cloud market to focus more on on-site and hybrid deployments.IMAGE SOURCE: HPE.After the split, HPE agreed to spin off and merge its slow-growth IT services unit with Computer Science Corp. in an $8.5 billion deal, then agreed to a similar spin-off of its ""non-core"" application delivery management, big data, and enterprise security businesses to Micro Focus International in an $8.8 billion deal. Those spin-mergers resulted in several rounds of layoffs, but those lower expenses boosted HPE's margins. That's why analysts expect HPE's earnings to grow 6% this year and another 1% next year.To pivot away from slow-growth businesses, HPE agreed to buy smaller companies in high growth markets -- including supercomputer maker SGI for $275 million and hyperconverged infrastructure vendor SimpliVity for $650 million. Both acquisitions strengthened HPE's position in the hybrid cloud market. As HPE pivots toward more of these high growth businesses, their revenues could juice up its top line growth again.HPE's P/E of 13 is much lower than its industry average of 21, and it pays a forward yield of 1%. That yield is low, but HPE's payout ratio of 12% indicates that it has plenty of room to raise its dividend in the near future.The key takeawayMany low P/E stocks tend to have low growth potential. Cisco and HPE's growth won't impress analysts anytime soon, but their low valuations will limit their downside potential during market downturns. That stability could be valuable if the market's lofty valuations catch up to it later this year.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The 4 Best Dividend Stocks in Cloud Computing,"Mar 29, 2017 at 4:06PM","Cloud companies often generate high sales growth with thin margins. They aren't usually associated with dividends, which generally indicate that a tech company's high growth days are over.Yet there are still a handful of stocks that expose investors to the growing cloud market while paying dependable dividends. Let's take a closer look at four such companies -- Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE).IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.MicrosoftMicrosoft's commercial cloud business hit an annual run rate of over $14 billion last quarter -- a 49% jump from a year earlier. CEO Satya Nadella expects that figure to hit $20 billion, or nearly a fifth of Microsoft's revenue, in fiscal 2018. That business generates most of its revenue from three cloud services -- Office 365, Dynamics CRM (customer relationship management), and the Azure cloud platform. Azure -- the second largest cloud platform after Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS (Amazon Web Services) -- hosts applications, analyzes data, and loans out computing power.Microsoft pays a forward dividend yield of 2.4%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 69%. The company has raised that payout annually for 13 straight years. Analysts expect Microsoft's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 5% and 7% this year, but its valuation looks a bit rich at 31 times earnings.IBMIBM's cloud business achieved an annual run rate of $13.7 billion last quarter, growing 35% from a year earlier and accounting for 17% of its top line. Within that total, its cloud services had an annual run rate of $8.6 billion -- a 61% jump from 2015. Big Blue bundles all its public, private, and hybrid cloud services into a platform called the IBM Cloud. Notable products in that suite include its AI platform Watson, Blockchain for digital transactions, and the Bluemix platform, which competes against AWS and Azure.Big Blue pays a forward dividend yield of 3.2% with a payout ratio of 44%. It's raised that dividend annually for 17 straight years. Its P/E of 14 is much lower than its industry average of 21, but analysts expect its revenue to fall 2% this year and for its earnings to rise just 2%.OracleOver the past few years, Oracle has grown its cloud businesses to offset sluggish demand for its aging database and hardware products. These products include a mix of SaaS, PaaS (platform as a service), and IaaS (infrastructure as a service) products -- which achieved a non-GAAP annual run rate of $5 billion last quarter. Last quarter, Oracle's total cloud revenues rose 62% annually to $1.2 billion and accounted for 13% of the tech giant's top line.Oracle's forward dividend yield of 1.4% is supported by a payout ratio of just 28% -- indicating that the tech giant could easily double its dividend if it wanted to. Nonetheless, Oracle's five straight years of dividend hikes have kept the yield well below 2%. Analysts expect Oracle's revenue and earnings to both rise just 1% this year, but its multiple of 21 is well below the industry average of 54 for application software makers.Hewlett-Packard EnterpriseHewlett-Packard Enterprise retained HP's enterprise hardware and software businesses after splitting with the PC, printing, and imaging businesses in late 2015. Shortly after the split, HPE shut down its Helion public cloud platform, which couldn't compete against larger rivals like AWS. But HPE continued providing support for private and hybrid cloud deployments, and tethered those systems to AWS, Azure, and other leading public cloud platforms. HPE's adjusted software revenue fell 1% annually last quarter, but within that business, its cloud software as a service (SaaS) revenue rose 6%.IMAGE SOURCE: HPE.HPE's forward yield of 1.1% looks paltry, but its payout ratio of 13% suggests that there's plenty of room for growth. Wall Street expects HPE's revenue and earnings to remain nearly flat this year, due to sluggish enterprise spending, but its trailing P/E of 12 makes it one of the cheapest large cap tech plays on the market today.The key takeawaysMicrosoft, IBM, Oracle, and HPE often showcase their cloud growth, but none of these mature companies are generating massive growth. That's because they're relying heavily on cloud growth to offset weakness as their older businesses -- like Microsoft's Windows, IBM's hardware and IT services, Oracle's database systems, and HPE's aging enterprise hardware and software. Investors should weigh the pros and cons of these companies before investing in them as cloud or income plays.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The 3 Best Big Data Stocks to Buy in 2017,"Mar 28, 2017 at 11:22AM","""Big data"" is one of those buzzwords that just won't go away. Search interest in the term started gathering steam in 2011 and remains on a roll today. We have covered the field in nearly 2,000 articles here at The Motley Fool.The big data concept will only grow more important over the next few years. This would be a great time to start investing in this exciting space, and I'll show you three fundamentally different ways to go about doing that today. Here's how Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) can get you started in big data investing.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The market momentum playSince Hewlett-Packard Enterprise parted ways with sister company HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) in November of 2015, the business-to-business technology specialist has rewarded investors with a 57% return. For the same period, the S&P 500 benchmark gained just 11%.And a large chunk of HP Enterprise's early success rested on the company's sharp big data focus.The idea of collecting, storing, and processing massive data collections permeates this company's operations from head to toe. HP Enterprise builds, installs, and maintains the hardware you need for designing a capable big data workflow. The company also covers the software required to incorporate big data concepts in your business, along with all the consulting services you need.If that weren't enough, management is investing even more resources in the big data space. The recently acquired network security specialist Niara, for example, uses data collection and analysis to identify and block advanced network attacks on the fly.Big data is a stated focus point for HP Enterprise, alongside the closely related data security and cloud computing markets. This strategy has worked wonders so far, and there's nothing wrong with betting that an established winner should keep on winning.IBM'S WATSON IOT CENTER IN MUNICH, GERMANY. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.The long-term strategy investmentIBM starts with big data everywhere, in the same vein as HP Enterprise. Then, the company takes the next logical step and uses this concept to build and power an even more progressive platform.Meet IBM Watson, Big Blue's artificial intelligence engine.Designed to pull actionable conclusions out of very large data sets, Watson is just about the closest thing we have to a computerized version of human intuition today. The system is set up and curated by human experts at first, and then continues to improve its cognitive processing models when new data is introduced. The more work Watson gets to do, the more it knows about that particular field. It's like training a human to become an expert -- hard work is rewarded with improvement.So Watson processes big data sets, using rules and connections learned from previously digested data sets. Big data begets more big data, preparing Watson to tackle increasingly large and complex problems.Three months ago, IBM kicked its Watson game into high gear.The company reorganized into five reporting segments. The brand new cognitive computing and industrial services division accounted for 43% of IBM's total sales in 2016, and 52% of its operating profits. This reorganization was done to assist IBM's ""ongoing transformation to a cognitive solutions and cloud platform business.""In other words, IBM is all about cognitive solutions these days, which puts Watson right at Big Blue's operational core. That's a solid commitment to harvesting, processing, and analyzing big data from every possible angle.It's important to note that IBM's strategic makeover has come at a cost. Top-line sales have suffered in recent years, and IBM investors have missed out on a 67% market rally over the last five years with a negative 15% return over the same period. In my view, the stock is selling at a generous discount for all the wrong reasons -- IBM is actually setting itself up for a leadership role in the next era of business computing.And it's all thanks to a firm commitment to big data.The beaten-down turnaround effortIf IBM shares look cheap right now, you ain't seen nothing yet.In early 2016, Tableau shares took a deep nosedive. The maker of visual tools for deep data analysis reported disappointing earnings and set up soft forward guidance, all due to ""softness"" in enterprise spending. Now take a look at the company's financial performance in the last three years, and tell me whether the market reaction seems justified or not:DATA DATA BY YCHARTS.So Tableau is still trading at a generous 47 times trailing non-GAAP earnings, but both sales and free cash flows are growing at an annual clip of 23%. Tableau is tapping into the analysis side of the big data trend, and to good effect. This is the kind of stock that deserves a growth-powered price premium.Now, it is true that Tableau has nearly doubled its sales year over year as recently as 2014, and that the company's revenue growth has consistently slowed down since then. Investors are currently betting that the top-line growth line will continue to move downward. Intense competition from larger tech titans supports that view.Then again, two of Tableau's closest rivals have gone private and seem less interested in competing for this company's client contracts these days. And Tableau itself is revamping its sales and marketing operations in order to earn a larger slice of the enterprise-class data analysis market.So Tableau is responding to a dynamic business environment in a credible way, and could very well reignite the old fires under its sales and profit growth again. If so, the stock would have a long climb ahead of it. This is a riskier bet than HP Enterprise or IBM, but perhaps a more rewarding one -- if you don't mind a bumpy ride to that final destination.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The 2 Best Dividend Stocks in the PC Industry,"Apr 19, 2017 at 5:04PM","In the age of the mobile computing, investing in the PC industry sure isn't what it used to be. As the latest in a litany of examples, the PC market contracted 5.7% year over year in 2016,  according to research firm IDC.However, for all the doom and gloom surrounding the PC market, the computer industry remains one of the most important subsectors in all of tech. In fact, even as unit volumes contract, over 260 million personal computers were sold last year globally, and the companies that remain at the center of this market -- names such as HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- continue to print tens of billions of dollars in aggregate profits from the space and pass them along to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. So let's review what makes these PC makers some of the best dividend stocks in the industry.HP Inc.After spinning off its server business into what today trades as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, the current HP Inc. represents one of the few pure-play PC companies to trade on American exchanges and also pay a dividend.As you might expect, the company's financial performance reflects the broader trends at work in the PC and printer industries, which are fairly ugly at the moment. Revenue declined 9.1% in the company's fiscal 2015 and 6.2% in 2016.  Few believe the PC industry will go away, but potential investors should understand that the growth outlook remains at best moderate for HP Inc. In fact, the majority of sell-side analysts rate its shares a hold and expect HP sales and profits to remain static over the next several years. Looking at the company's dividend specs, HP shares currently yield 2.9%, which sits well above the S&P 500's current 1.9% yield.  The company currently pays out 34% of its earnings as dividends, which suggests it could grow its payments in the future. The company's balance sheet isn't overly leveraged, and the bulk of its debt comes due in five years or more. However, even though HP deserves a place on this list because of its prominence within the industry, the following name might prove to be a more attractive option for income investors.IMAGE SOURCE: APPLE.AppleThough the iPhone remains the profit center that powers Apple's financial performance, the Mac maker remains a force in the PC industry as well. In fact, IDC ranked Apple as the fifth largest PC maker in the world last year, with an estimated 7.1% share of worldwide computer shipments. Apple's shipments and market share declined from 2015 to 2016, though, and it isn't clear which aspects of its PC and notebook business it plans to update this year.The company already updated its MacBook Pro lineup last year. Having already killed off the 11-inch MacBook Air,  and with the ultra-thin 12-inch MacBook Pro appearing to have erased much of the use case for the 13-inch MacBook Air, it seems unlikely Apple will launch dramatically revamped laptops this year.The company reportedly has several important changes in the works to its desktop products. Having gone several years without a meaningful update, Apple is in the midst of overhauling the Mac Pro, though the refreshed model isn't expected in calendar year 2017. That leaves the iMac as the lone piece of Apple's PC business due for an update this year.  Expect this update to come at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June, if it is indeed in the works.Regardless of Apple's place in the PC market, the company is a solid dvidend payer and seems likely to continue to be for the foreseeable future. If history is any indication, Apple will raise its dividend as part of its upcoming earnings report on May 2. The company has already returned $201 billion to shareholders since 2012,  and this year's likely iPhone upgrade cycle should further pad Apple's ability to afford further dividends and share repurchases in the coming years.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here's How Hewlett-Packard Company Crushed It in 2017,"Dec 18, 2017 at 3:18PM","It's difficult to believe HP (NYSE:HPQ) is reporting the kind of fourth-quarter 2017 earnings that it shared in late November. Not only did the king of PCs end the year in style compared to 2016, but the differences are night and day.At $35 billion, HP's market capitalization isn't overly large, but for a company of that size to implement CEO Dion Weisler's initiatives so quickly is remarkable. One reason I've been tooting HP's horn since its split with HP Enterprise was my confidence in Weisler's vision. As demonstrated last quarter, the plan is coming together even faster than I imagined.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Wrapped and tied with a bowIf you follow the tech industry, you've no doubt heard the news: PCs are dead. That same mantra is one reason there were so many HP naysayers. Thing is, not only was that negativity overblown; it simply doesn't apply to HP.PC shipments edged down 0.5% last quarter, with most PC manufacturers experiencing little to no growth, according to research firm IDC. Despite the industry's so-so quarter, HP shipments jumped 6%, handily outdistancing China rival Lenovo's (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY) meager 0.1% increase. HP now owns 22.8% of the stabilizing global PC market compared to Lenovo's 21.6%, making it the world's leading PC manufacturer.How did HP outpace its competitors? Weisler's plan was and is to strategically target niche markets, rather than try to be all things to all people. One example is HP's new-ish virtual reality (VR) -ready OMEN PC for the world's gamers.Last quarter, HP's PC division generated revenue of $9.1 billion, up 13% compared to 2016. Leading the way were the 16% and 10% gains in laptop and desktop sales, respectively. For some perspective, in 2016's fourth quarter, PC sales were up just 4% to $8 billion, with just a 6% increase in laptops and 2% for desktops. The strong PC results helped boost total revenue up 11% to $13.9 billion, and per-share earnings to $0.39, 30% above last year's $0.30 a share.IMAGE SOURCE: HP.Don't fix it if it ain't brokenEven PCs take a back seat to the turnaround HP's printing has undergone. Once the bane of HP, printing has become a key driver of growth. A year ago, printing revenue totaled $4.56 billion, down 8%. Poor supply sales, which dropped 12% to $2.84 billion, was the culprit. Supplies are the primary source of printing revenue, and they were dragging down both unit results and HP's total sales.By 2017's fourth quarter, printing is not only growing -- it's significantly contributing to HP's top line. Printing sales rose 7% to $4.89 billion to end HP's fiscal year, and that's not even the best part. The majority of the improvement came from supply sales, which soared 10% to $3.13 billion. What a difference a year makes.HP was able to exceed expectations by using a similar strategy as it does with PCs. One example is the HP Sprocket, a pocket photo printer designed for selfie-lovers around the world. At $130, the sprocket isn't a primary revenue driver, but it does demonstrate HP's shift in its go-to-market strategy. Though, HP does charge sprocket users $10 for 20 photo-ready paper refills.HP has also developed an automated printing supply ordering system in which the printer instantly shoots an order to HP when it ""recognizes"" toner is getting low. A more impactful example of HP's targeting initiative is the expansion of its printing solutions following the $1.05 billion deal for Samsung's printing division.Assets from the Samsung acquisition will jump-start HP's multifunction printing offerings. The copier market represents a $55 billion opportunity, which HP plans to shake up with a printer that also acts as a copier designed for commercial customers. The deal also lights a fire under HP's laser printing efforts. Toss in the upside of the fast-growing 3D printing market, and HP's printing division will continue growing.But what about next year?With its stock up 40% in 2017, HP stock can't still be a value, can it? At 15 times trailing earnings, HP is priced well below its peer average of 27 times earnings. HP is also a bargain by virtually every other metric, and its 2.6% dividend yield dwarfs its peers' 1.5% average payout.Don't be surprised to see HP crush it in 2018, just as it has in 2017.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

A Close Look at Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.'s Double-Digit Dividend Increase,"Nov 28, 2017 at 12:33PM","When investors think of dividend stocks in tech, two of the most popular names that might come to mind are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). Microsoft has been paying a dividend since 2003, and IBM has been paying a dividend for decades. Further, both companies have boasted meaningful dividend yields in recent years.However, I'd argue there's an easily overlooked dividend stock in tech that deserves similar recognition -- particularly after its recent dividend increase: Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE).IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's dividendBased on recent dividend growth, it's clear that the enterprise technology company is prioritizing dividends for its investors. On Nov. 9, HPE said it is increasing its regular dividend from $0.65 to $0.75. This represents a nice 15% increase -- not far below its 18% dividend increase last year.But here's where things may get a bit confusing when it comes to analyzing HPE's dividend -- and why its dividend can get overlooked. At first glance, some investors may conclude HPE's dividend history doesn't come close to Microsoft's or IBM's. But this isn't true -- at least not when you take into consideration the dividends it was paying before HPE Co. and HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) were divested into separate publicly traded entities in 2015.As its own entity, HPE has only been paying dividends since the summer of 2015. But the parent company it came from, HP, has been paying dividends since 1992. Further, HP increased its dividend in many of these years, barring a stretch between 1999 and 2011 in which it held its dividend at the same rate.Comparatively, Microsoft didn't initiate its dividend until 2003. IBM has paid a dividend since 1913.Growth potentialCompanyDividend YieldPayout RatioMost Recent Dividend IncreaseHewlett-Packard Enterprise2.25%27%15%Microsoft2.00%53%8%IBM3.95%48%7%HP2.62%35%5%DATA SOURCE: REUTERS. TABLE BY AUTHOR.When it comes to dividend growth potential, HPE easily beats out both Microsoft and IBM. This is immediately evident in the double-digit annualized dividend growth HPE has been serving investors versus Microsoft and IBM's most recent increases of 8% and 7%. HPE's dividend growth even looks better than HP's; HP only increased its dividend by 5% this year.And HPE's dividend growth potential begins to look even better when investors take a look at the underlying business. While Microsoft, IBM, and HP are paying out 53%, 48%, and 35% of their trailing-12-month earnings in dividends, respectively, HPE is only paying out only 27% of its earnings. In other words, HPE's dividend has both more room for further increases and more wiggle room if earnings take a hit.Of course, not everything about HPE's dividend is better than these tech giants. Its 2.25% dividend yield, for example, is far below IBM's dividend yield of nearly 4%. It's also below HP's dividend yield of 2.6%. But HPE's dividend yield is slightly ahead of Microsoft's 2% yield.To be fair, Microsoft and IBM are both much larger and more established industry leaders than HPE, giving them an edge over the enterprise technology company when it comes to durability. But a close look at HPE's dividend compared to other technology peers certainly highlights some enticing characteristics, making it worthy of a spot on an income investor's watchlist."
Why Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Shares Opened Lower Today,"Sep 1, 2017 at 12:56PM","What happenedShares of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) opened much lower today at $14.13, compared to yesterday's close of $18.06. That might appear to be quite a drop, but the price change is only due to the company completing its spinoff and merger of its software business with Micro Focus.So whatThe $8.8 billion deal was originally announced in September 2016, as part of CEO Meg Whitman's ongoing efforts to make HPE a slimmer and more agile company. HPE received a $2.5 billion cash payment and will retain 50.1% ownership (approximately 222 million American depositary shares) of the new combined company.IMAGE SOURCE: HPE.The spinoff also puts an end to HPE's controversial acquisition of Autonomy in 2011, as those software assets are being included in the deal.Now what""With the completion of this transaction, HPE has achieved a major milestone in becoming a stronger, more focused company, purpose-built to compete and win in today's market,"" Whitman said in a statement. ""And, this transaction will deliver approximately $8.8 billion to HPE and its stockholders."" The completion of the spinoff comes months after HPE spun off and merged its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences Corporation to form DXC Technology in April. With the software and enterprise services businesses now unloaded, HPE is better positioned to focus on its hybrid IT and software-defined infrastructure strategy.The company will provide an update to its fiscal 2017 outlook next Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2017, when it reports earnings, as the software business will no longer contribute to financial results going forward.10 stocks we like better than Hewlett Packard EnterpriseWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

7 Simple Reasons I Bought HP Inc. Stock,"Oct 30, 2017 at 2:38PM","When HP (NYSE:HPQ) split with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) two years ago, many analysts believed that HP, which retained the PC and printer businesses, would be a weaker play than HPE, which kept the enterprise hardware and software businesses.Yet HP rallied about 45% over the past year, while HPE rose just 6%. I believe that HP's rally isn't over yet, so I recently started a position in the stock for seven simple reasons.IMAGE SOURCE: HP.1. Accelerating revenue growthHP is generally considered a slow-growth ""mature"" tech stock. Yet the company posted four straight quarters of accelerating revenue growth, fueled by rebounding sales of its PCs and printers.PeriodQ4 2016Q1 2017Q2 2017Q3 2017Revenue$12.5 billion$12.7 billion$12.4 billion$13.1 billionYOY growth1.9%3.7%7%9.8%SOURCE: HP QUARTERLY REPORTS.Looking ahead, analysts expect HP's revenue to rise 6%% annually during the fourth quarter and 7% for the full year, compared to a 6% decline in fiscal 2016.2. Robust overseas growthHP is generating robust growth in overseas markets. Last quarter, its revenue from the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and Asia-Pacific regions -- which together account for 52% of its revenues -- respectively rose 10% and 15% annually. Its North American revenues, which accounted for the remaining 48%, rose 8%.3. A ""best in breed"" PC businessPrior to splitting with HPE, HP's PC business was overtaken by Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY) to become the largest PC vendor in the world. But HP reclaimed that title earlier this year by posting multiple quarters of year-over-year shipments growth amid an ongoing slowdown in worldwide PC sales.IMAGE SOURCE: HP.Research firm Gartner recently reported that HP's PC shipments rose 4.4% annually during the third quarter, marking its fifth straight quarter of growth and making it the only leading PC vendor to post positive growth.HP attributes that recovery to more appealing laptop designs, rosy demand for higher-end devices, and new security features for enterprise users. That's why its Personal Systems (PCs) revenue rose 12% annually last quarter. By comparison, Lenovo's PCSD (PC and Smart Devices) unit posted flat year-over-year sales growth last quarter as it tried to offset sluggish shipment volumes with price hikes.4. An evolving printing businessHP's printing revenues also rose 6% annually last quarter as higher sales of consumer units and supplies offset flat growth in the commercial segment. HP is diversifying this business away from the commoditized inkjet and laser printer markets toward higher-growth markets -- which include mobile printers, multi-function printers (which can replace copiers, fax machines, and scanners), industrial 3D printers, and even next-gen metal 3D printers.IMAGE SOURCE: HP.HP also agreed to buy Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) printing unit, which will scale up its manufacturing operations and give it a larger share of the multi-function printer market.5. Steady margins and rebounding earnings growthFor a company that operates in two commoditized markets, HP's non-GAAP operating margin held steady, dipping just one percentage point annually to 8% last quarter.HP's non-GAAP earnings fell 10% annually last quarter, primarily due to higher component costs (especially memory chips), and are expected to rise just 3% this year. However, component costs are expected to gradually decline in 2018, enabling HP to post 8% earnings growth next year.Meanwhile, HP's cash and equivalents rose 11% annually to nearly $7 billion. This gives it plenty of room to expand into adjacent markets with new investments or acquisitions.6. It's a shareholder friendly companyIn the first three quarters of 2017, HP returned $524 million, or 56% of its FCF, to its shareholders. The company previously stated that it would return ""50% to 75%"" of its free cash flow (FCF) to shareholders via buybacks and dividends.During last quarter's conference call, CFO Cathie Lesjak stated that HP still planned ""to deliver returns toward the higher end of the range"" -- which means that investors could see accelerated buybacks and a big dividend hike by the end of the year.7. Its dividend and valuation limit its downside potentialHP currently pays a forward dividend yield of 2.5%, which beats the S&P 500's average yield of 1.9% and HPE's forward yield of 1.8%. HP also trades at just 12 times next year's earnings, which is surprisingly cheap after its year-long rally. Therefore, that decent yield and low valuation should protect the stock during major market downturns.The bottom lineBack in March, I declared that the ""best was yet to come"" for HP. But I didn't take my own advice at the time, and missed out on a 24% gain. I don't plan on missing the next leg up, so I'm buying some shares here as this mature tech stock warms up again. "
Tech Stocks Last Week: Amazon's Big Deals and Hewlett Packard Enterprise's CEO News,"Nov 26, 2017 at 10:36AM","With some of the biggest shopping days of the year now in the rearview mirror, here's a look back at the biggest headlines in tech during Thanksgiving week. Namely, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) unveiled some steep discounts on its website as it aims to keep up its breakneck growth, and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's (NYSE:HPE) CEO is preparing to step down after a very successful tenure at the company's helm.Here's what investors should know about each of these storiesAmazon's big dealsThroughout last week, Amazon steeply discounted some of its most popular Alexa-enabled smart speakers, Kindle e-readers, and Fire tablets. Some of the most notable sales included a $29.99 Echo Dot ($20 off), $79.99 for the newest version of its Echo ($20 off), and $99.99 for its Fire 10 tablet ($50 off). ECHO DOT. IMAGE SOURCE: AMAZON.COM.On Friday, Amazon announced its Cyber Monday deals, which Amazon said would begin on Monday. But Amazon noted that select deals would be available early for customers shopping with its Alexa voice assistant. While Cyber Monday extends many of the deals seen throughout Thanksgiving week and on Black Friday weekend, it introduces some notable new deals, including a $179.99 Echo Show ($50 off) and a 40% discount on a Kindle Unlimited membership.It would be difficult to overstate the importance of shopping holidays to Amazon's business. As Amazon said in its press release on Friday, last year Amazon had a record-breaking Cyber Monday, selling 740 items per second. Further, on Cyber Monday last year, Amazon Echo device sales were more than 7 times higher than sales on Cyber Monday in 2015.Amazon guided for monstrous growth in its fourth-quarter sales, suggesting management expected a wildly successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping holidays. Management said it expected fourth-quarter revenue to rise between 28% and 38% year over year, to between $56 billion and $60.5 billion. In Amazon's fourth quarter of 2016, revenue didn't rise nearly this sharply; net sales during the period climbed 22% year over year to $43.7 billion. Also worth noting, the high end of this guidance range would mark a significant acceleration in Amazon's recent revenue growth; third-quarter revenue was up 34% year over year.Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's CEO prepares to step downConfirming The Wall Street Journal's report in September that HPE's accomplished CEO Meg Whitman began to make plans to step down from her leadership role from the company, Whitman announced last week that she is officially planning to step down early next year.Whitman will be replaced by Antonio Neri, the current president of HPE, effective Feb. 1.in a company SEC filing filed Tuesday, Whitman commented on her plans to hand over the reins:I'm incredibly proud of all we've accomplished since I joined HP in 2011. Today, Hewlett-Packard moves forward as four industry-leading companies that are each well positioned to win in their respective markets. Now is the right time for Antonio and a new generation of leaders to take the reins of HPE. I have tremendous confidence that they will continue to build a great company that will thrive well into the future.HPE has significantly outperformed popular market indices since it spun off from its personal computing and printer operations units on Nov. 2, 2015. At the time of HPE's press release last week, total shareholder return since the birth of HPE stock in 2015 was 89% -- over three times what the S&P 500 has appreciated in this same period.Should Amazon be on your buy list?

"Why Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Qudian, and Movado Group Slumped Today","Nov 22, 2017 at 4:30PM","Wednesday was a quiet day for the stock market, with major benchmarks seeing relatively little movement overall in advance of the day off that investors will get for Thanksgiving. With Congress on break for the holiday week, further action on the political front will pause until Monday, and a lack of major macroeconomic news meant there were no big catalysts to drive significant market moves. Still, a few companies suffered from bad news that sent their shares downward. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), Qudian (NYSE:QD), and Movado Group (NYSE:MOV) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.HP Enterprise loses its leaderShares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise fell 7% after CEO Meg Whitman surprised investors by announcing that she will resign from her position as of Feb. 1. The move arguably shouldn't have shocked shareholders as much as it did, given that Whitman had initially set out a five-year turnaround plan when she was named to the chief executive role in late 2011. Antonio Neri is set to take over as CEO come early 2018, but the move raises major concerns about the future strategic direction for the HP spinoff. Whitman will remain on HP Enterprise's board, but some of those who follow the stock were disappointed given comments earlier in the year that had suggested continuity in the CEO role -- at least in the near term.MEG WHITMAN. IMAGE SOURCE: HEWLETT-PACKARD ENTERPRISE.Qudian tangles with ChinaQudian stock plunged 16%, marking the second straight day of declines in the wake of new regulation from the government in China. The Chinese consumer credit provider had seemed to be doing well, with solid revenue and earnings growth in its most recent quarterly report last week. Yet a decline on Tuesday came from rumors of potential oversight, and confirmed news that local governments in China were directed to stop providing licenses to new entrants to the microloan business showed the level of antipathy in Beijing toward companies like Qudian. With internet finance squarely in China's crosshairs, Qudian could have trouble maintaining its momentum going forward.Movado winds backwardsFinally, shares of Movado Group fell 8%. The move essentially reversed the gains that the watchmaker had enjoyed yesterday following favorable third-quarter financial results. Movado had raised its guidance for revenue and earnings for the full 2018 fiscal year, and many investors had anticipated that the company might be able to build momentum heading into the key holiday shopping season. Yet with shares having jumped by a third just since August, Movado investors seemed ready to take a break and wait for initial results from Black Friday before becoming too confident in the company's future.10 stocks we like better than Movado GroupWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

4 Reasons Why I Love HP Inc. Stock,"Aug 18, 2017 at 10:00AM","Many investors think of HP (NYSE:HPQ) as a sleepy ""mature"" tech stock with limited growth potential. Yet HP shares rallied nearly 30% this year, beating the S&P 500's 10% gain and a 24% decline at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) -- from which it split in late 2015.But even after that impressive rally, I believe that HP still has room to run. Let's take a look at four key catalysts that might help the stock hit new post-split highs this year.HP'S SPECTRE LAPTOP. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.1. Its recovering PC businessIn previous years, HP's PC business was hurt by the disruptive growth of smartphones and tablets, longer upgrade cycles, and competition from rivals like Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY) -- which overtook HP as the world's top PC maker four years ago.The PC market remains in a five-year slump, with shipments falling year over year for 11 straight quarters, according to Gartner's latest figures. But amid that decline, HP mounted a comeback against Lenovo with five straight quarters of annual shipments growth.That growth -- fueled by robust demand for its high-end laptops and convertibles, especially in the U.S. -- helped HP reclaim its title as the world's top PC vendor with a 21% market share during the second quarter. Out of the five top PC vendors, only HP and Dell (the third largest vendor) posted positive shipments growth.That's why HP's Personal Systems (PC) revenue rose 10% annually last quarter, with its 12% growth in notebook shipments offsetting a 6% decline in desktop shipments. The competition will remain tough, and rising component prices (especially memory) will impact its margins, but HP's core business remains poised to grow as many of its rivals struggle.2. A growing printing businessPrinting devices might seem like a slow growth business, but HP's printing revenue rose 2% annually last quarter, buoyed by 6% growth in commercial hardware shipments and 3% growth in consumer hardware shipments. That growth indicates that despite the higher use of digital documents and the rise of ""paper free"" offices, people are still printing things.AN HP INKJET PRINTER. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.HP is also diversifying its printing business with mobile printers (like the Sprocket) for smartphones, industrial 3D printers for manufacturers, and A3 copiers. To boost its single-digit market share of the A3 copier market, HP agreed to acquire Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) printing business late last year.HP believes that purchase -- which will become earnings accretive within the first year of closing -- can improve the printing business' margins with economies of scale, and enable it to produce multi-function printers that can simultaneously replace traditional printers and copiers.3. Simple, slow, and steady growthIn hindsight, splitting with HPE was a great move for HP. HPE took all the complex, slow-growth enterprise hardware and software businesses off its plate, leaving the ""new"" HP with the comparatively easy-to-understand businesses of PCs and printers.Wall Street expects HP's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 4% and 2.5% this year. Those growth figures aren't exciting, but they easily beat Lenovo's projected sales growth of 2% and flat earnings growth this year.4. Its generous dividend and low valuationHP currently pays a forward dividend yield of 2.8%, which beats the S&P 500's 2% yield and HPE's 1.5% yield. Over the past 12 months, HP spent just 36% of its earnings and 34% of its free cash flow on those dividends -- so it still has plenty of room for future dividend hikes.HP has been a popular stock over the past year, but the stock remains surprisingly cheap at 13 times earnings, compared to the industry average P/E of 21 for PC manufacturers. Its price-to-sales ratio of 0.7 also remains below the industry average of one.A safe buy for a frothy marketWith the market hovering near all-time highs, it's getting tougher to find compelling investments in the tech industry. However, I think the ""new"" HP remains a great pick for investors looking for a fundamentally cheap stock with a solid dividend and steady growth.

Why 2017 Was a Year to Remember for HP Inc.,"Dec 6, 2017 at 8:10AM","Not long ago, HP (NYSE:HPQ) was on the wrong end of most every industry pundit's expectations. The negativity centered on the ""dying"" PC market and HP's floundering printing unit. HP continued to report fairly strong PC sales, but it was just a matter of time before the rug was pulled out from under it -- or so the bears thought.As we wind up 2017, it's apparent that HP is firmly established as the dominant player in the PC market. To the astonishment of some, HP's printing unit isn't just holding its own; it's also become a growth engine. CEO Dion Weisler deserves much of the kudos for implementing a new development and sales strategy.For investors in search of growth and income, the better news is that HP remains a bargain despite its stellar performance in 2017.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The foundation is completeUp 45%, HP's stock has performed admirably this year to say the least. Not only is HP stock's performance warranted, but there's also still plenty of upside. At a mere  15.4 times trailing earnings, HP is valued well below its peers. For perspective, it's trading at just 11.8 times expected earnings, about half today's average of 23.3 times trailing earnings.Remarkably, despite its outstanding quarter to end the fiscal year, HP shares sank 6%. However, HP's total revenue of $13.93 billion  was good for an 11% year-over-year increase, led by a 16% jump in PC sales. HP also performed on the bottom line, reporting per-share earnings of $0.39, 30% above last year's $0.30 per share.HP's printing unit also finished 2017 on a high note, climbing 7% to $4.88 billion. The best-performing segment within the division was supply sales, which rose 10% to $3.13 billion. A year  ago, printing revenue was down 8% to $4.56 billion, largely because of a painful 12% decline in supply sales.But implementing an automated supply ordering feature, among other strategic moves, has since reinvigorated the entire printing unit. With the $1.05 billion deal for Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) printing division said and done, HP's should see continued growth.IMAGE SOURCE: HP.The best is yet to comeNot only are PCs alive and well -- at least for HP, after becoming the world leader again this year -- but research firm Gartner also expects a slight  increase in sales in 2018. Sure, the 0.08% isn't much, but it would be the first PC sales increase in nearly seven years. HP is more than holding its own in 2017, with third-quarter shipments rising  4.4%.HP's continued PC growth is really impressive, considering it was the only manufacturer to chalk up a rise in sales. China-based Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY), the one-time global PC leader, registered a 1.5% drop in shipments last quarter, and Dell, which is a distant third to HP and Lenovo, was down 0.4%.Weisler's decision to concentrate on targeting niche markets is working wonders. Devices like HP's virtual reality-ready OMEN series is designed for the world's gamers, and Weisler's business shift is working in printing as well.Strong and getting strongerAnother example of HP's sales and development plans is its Sprocket device, a pocket-sized photo printer. Priced at $130, the sprocket isn't going to boost printing sales dramatically, but it serves as a clear indication of HP's new-ish direction -- not to mention the $10 in paper supplies when a user needs a refill.The aforementioned deal with Samsung is very  much in line with HP's targeting of specific markets. In addition to over 6,500 printing patents and nearly 1,300 technicians, a key component of the acquisition is HP's new A3 business printer.The $55 billion A3 market is ""the largest growth opportunity in business printing."" The A3 targets professionals in search of a high-end copier with multi-function print capabilities. Fewer components translate to fewer paper jams and service calls.When it's all said and doneIt's only been two years since HP split with Hewlett-Packard Enterprises, which makes its strong results even more impressive. Considering its discounted share price, 2.5% dividend yield, and growth across every segment, 2017 was certainly a year to remember for HP.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why HP Inc. Shareholders Have Nothing to Worry About,"Jul 17, 2017 at 9:08AM","When HP (NYSE:HPQ) split with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) in late 2015, HP retained the company's PC, printing, and imaging businesses, while HPE kept the enterprise hardware and software units.At the time, many analysts believed that HP would continue to be a slower-growth income play, while HPE would deliver faster growth. But over the past 12 months, HP shares have rallied more than 30%, while HPE shares fell about 13%.HP'S SPECTRE X2. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.Analysts expect HP's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 4% and 3% this year. Those numbers don't sound exciting, but they're solid figures for a ""mature tech"" company. Looking ahead, I believe HP investors don't have anything to worry about -- since the stock should head higher for three simple reasons.1. A growing market leader in a sluggish marketResearch firm Gartner recently reported that global PC shipments fell 4% annually during the second quarter, marking the industry's 11th straight quarter of declining shipments. That slowdown was mainly attributed to the rise of mobile devices and longer PC upgrade cycles, and it was exacerbated by higher costs of components such as memory chips, solid-state drives, and LCD panels that drove up PC prices.But amid those industry declines, HP posted its fifth straight quarter of year-over-year shipments growth, and it reclaimed its crown as the world's top PC maker from Lenovo. HP's PCs sold particularly well in the U.S., which has been a tough market for other PC makers.That growth is reflected in HP's 10% annual growth in personal-systems revenue last quarter. Double-digit sales growth of its notebooks, fueled by higher demand for ultrabooks and 2-in-1 devices, offset a single-digit decline in desktop sales.2. An evolving printing businessHP's printing unit has also been diversifying away from traditional consumer printers. It's introduced new mobile printers for smartphones, such as the popular Sprocket, along with new industrial 3D printers for manufacturers and new A3 copiers. HP controls only 4% of the A3 copier market, but that share should significantly rise after its acquisition of Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) printing business closes later this year.HP'S SPROCKET MOBILE PRINTER. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.HP says the $1.05 billion deal, which it announced last September, could help it ""disrupt and reinvent"" the $55 billion copier industry by replacing existing copiers with new multi-function printers. HP also believes the Samsung acquisition will become accretive to earnings in the first full year after the deal closes.The ongoing changes at HP's printing unit are already reflected in its 2% annual revenue growth last quarter. Sales of both its commercial and consumer printers rose, and those figures should keep improving as the business evolves.3. Low valuations and a solid dividendHP trades at 13 times earnings, which is far below the industry average P/E of 21 for PC manufacturers. Its price-to-sales ratio of 0.6 is also much lower than the industry average of 1.HP's forward dividend yield is 2.9%, which is much higher than HPE's 1.5%. Over the past 12 months, HP spent just 36% of its earnings and 34% of its free cash flow on those dividends -- so it has plenty of room for future increases.In the first half of 2017, HP returned 95% of its free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, easily exceeding its previous full-year target of 50% to 75%.The key takeawaysHP isn't a high-growth stock. But its PC business is outperforming its industry during a tough multi-year downturn, its printing business is launching new products and entering new markets, and it's keeping shareholders happy with big dividends and buybacks. All these factors make HP a solid income play for a frothy and unpredictable market. "
Is HP Inc. a Buy After its Post-Earnings Plunge?,"Nov 24, 2017 at 1:19PM","Shares of HP (NYSE:HPQ) dropped 6% on Nov. 22 after the PC and printer maker reported its fourth quarter earnings. That decline was surprising, since HP's numbers looked solid -- its revenue rose 11% annually to $13.9 billion, beating expectations by $550 million. Its non-GAAP net income rose 22% to $700 million, or $0.44 per share, matching analyst expectations.So why were investors so eager to sell HP? Let's take a closer look at HP's fourth quarter numbers to find out.IMAGE SOURCE: HP.PC sales remain strongHP's Personal Systems (PC) revenue rose 13% annually to $9.1 billion, and total shipments grew 6%. Notebook shipments rose 8% annually, with 16% sales growth, and desktop shipments improved 2% with 10% sales growth. Its commercial and consumer revenues respectively rose 11% and 18%.HP's growth is an anomaly in the PC industry, where shipments have declined for 12 straight quarters, according to Gartner. The firm reports that HP was the only PC vendor to grow its market share annually during the third quarter, as all of its main rivals -- Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY), Dell, Asus, Apple, and Acer -- posted annual declines.That recovery -- which helped HP reclaim its crown as the world's top PC maker from Lenovo earlier this year -- was largely attributed to better premium laptop designs, new high-end gaming laptops, more secure PCs for enterprise customers, and strength in the North American market.However, the unit's operating margin still fell 50 basis points annually to 3.8% due to rising component prices. HP is raising prices worldwide and leveraging the scale of its supply chain to offset those higher expenses, but those prices (especially memory chips) should remain elevated for at least another year.Printer sales are also risingHP's printing revenues rose 7% annually to $4.9 billion as total shipments grew 3%. Shipments of consumer printers rose 3%, but shipments of commercial printers stayed flat. Supplies revenue rose 10% annually.Looking ahead, HP expects its acquisition of Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) printing business to improve the business' scale while increasing its market presence in A3 multifunction printers, which can simultaneously replace printers, scanners, copiers, and fax machines. However, that acquisition also includes Samsung's weaker A4 printer business, which has been struggling in the low-end market.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.HP is also launching industrial 3D printers for enterprise customers and plans to introduce metal 3D printers in the near future. Those new products could significantly boost its commercial printing revenues.The printing unit's operating margin rose 260 basis points to 16.6%. A large part of that gain was attributed to a one-time change to its supply sales model in the prior year quarter, which resulted in unusually lower margins.But even excluding that adjustment, HP CFO Catherine Lesjak stated that the unit ""saw good operating profit dollar expansion year-over-year."" However, the unit's operating margin still dipped 40 basis points sequentially due to ""materially higher-than-normal unit shipments"" in the lower-margin consumer market.The outlook and valuations look solidHP expects its first-quarter earnings to rise 5% to 13%, and for its fiscal 2018 earnings to grow 6% to 13%. Both figures matched analyst expectations. HP's stock has already rallied more than 40% this year, but the stock still looks fairly cheap at 12 times next year's earnings.HP expects to generate ""at least"" $3 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2018, compared to about $3.9 billion in fiscal 2017. HP returned 59% of that total to shareholders through dividends and buybacks throughout the year.HP recently raised its dividend for the second time after its split with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) in late 2015. That gives it a forward yield of 2.6%, compared to HPE's yield of 2.2% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.9%.The bottom lineHP's post-earnings sell-off was seemingly triggered by the company merely matching bottom line estimates instead of beating them, profit taking, and HPE's bleak guidance and the resignation of its CEO Meg Whitman -- which caused some confusion but had nothing to do with the ""new"" HP.Therefore, I believe that HP's pullback represents a smart long-term buying opportunity since its core businesses are healthy, the stock is cheap, and it pays a decent dividend.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

HP's Plans for 3D Metal Printing Could be a Game Changer,"Oct 25, 2017 at 7:00AM","HP (NYSE:HPQ) CEO Dion Weisler recently revealed that his company planned to launch next-gen 3D printers that could produce metal objects. Weisler didn't reveal much else about the technology or the prices, but declared that HP would reveal more information next year.Weisler stated that he was signaling ""the intent"" HP had in entering the market so it could initiate discussions with potential customers that wanted to print 3D metal objects. That announcement, along with HP's gradual entrance into the industrial 3D printing market, caused shares of popular 3D printing plays 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) to slide over the past six months.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Why is HP making 3D printers?HP split with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) in late 2015. HP retained the PC and printer businesses, while HPE kept the enterprise hardware and software units. At the time, HP was considered a slower-growth play than HPE, since global PC shipments were weak and printers were heavily commoditized.Yet HP defied expectations by redesigning its PCs and focusing on higher-growth categories like 2-in-1s and premium laptops. As a result, HP's shipments rose as industry-wide shipments declined. Gartner's latest numbers reveal that HP's shipments grew 4.4% annually during the third quarter, as all of its rivals -- including Lenovo, Dell, Asus, Apple, and Acer -- posted single-digit declines. That's why HP's Personal Systems (PC) revenue rose 12% annually to $8.4 billion last quarter.HP'S SPROCKET MOBILE PRINTER. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.As for printers, HP diversified away from traditional inkjet and laser printers with higher-growth niche products like mobile printers (for smartphones), industrial 3D printers, and multi-function printers that can simultaneously replace copiers and printers. HP also secured about 65 channel partners and scaled up by acquiring Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) printing business, which will boost the unit's margins and market share in the multi-function printer space.HP's Printing revenue rose 6% to $4.7 billion last quarter as stronger sales of consumer printers offset a slight decline in commercial printer sales. But since commercial printers usually have higher margins than consumer ones, the unit's operating margin fell 310 basis points annually to 17.3%. Expanding further into 3D printing, especially with new features like metal printing, could help HP move well ahead of its rivals and boost its commercial printing revenues again and expand the unit's margins.What's the market opportunity here?Manufacturers mostly use 3D printers to produce small rubber and plastic parts. But by making the jump to metal objects, manufacturers could potentially print screws, nails, cases, and other custom parts.HP claims that the entire manufacturing market is worth $12 trillion, but admits that the industrial 3D printing market only accounts for a drop in that pond. CFO Cathie Lesjak also warned that its 3D printing business still isn't profitable and remains in ""investment mode,"" while Weisler noted that 3D printers don't generate meaningful revenues for the company yet.Nonetheless, companies like 3D Systems and Stratasys should be concerned, since HP can afford to run the unit at a loss for years to build up its market share. 3D Systems and Stratasys are both much smaller and unprofitable on a GAAP basis, so they could be in serious trouble if HP turns up the heat.HP's firing on all cylindersHP stock already rallied nearly 50% this year, but it still trades at a reasonable 12 times forward earnings and pays a solid 2.4% yield. Analysts expect the stable growth of its PC and printing businesses to respectively lift its revenue and earnings by 7% and 3% this year.Looking ahead, HP will likely keep dominating the PC market as its printing business evolves beyond traditional printers. It's only taken baby steps into the 3D printing market with a handful of partners like Jaguar Land Rover and Siemens, but it could eventually dominate the market with a wide variety of 3D printing technologies -- like the ability to print metal objects.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

HPE CEO Whitman Didn't Leave for Uber -- but She Still Might Depart This Fall,"Sep 13, 2017 at 8:04AM","Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) investors may have relaxed too soon.While HPE CEO Meg Whitman won't be the new Uber CEO, sources told the Wall Street Journal that she is making arrangements to leave the company and could depart as soon as this fall. Her potential departure is a significant concern for investors because she has been the leader (and face) of the company's turnaround efforts over the past six years.Whitman deciding to leave during her sixth year at the company would make sense, considering she laid out a five-year turnaround plan back in 2012, she might, therefore, see her job as done. Since Whitman was named HPE CEO on Sept. 22, 2011, the company's stock has risen about 36%. HPE data by YChartsBack in 2012, investors thought her five-year timeline was too long. ""They were like, 'You've got to be kidding me. Five years?'"" Whitman told the Journal. ""I think they just didn't quite understand how deep the hole HP had dug itself.""In 2015, Whitman led the company's risky separation into two Fortune 100 companies: technology solutions company Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, and printing and personal-computer business HP Inc..HPE CEO MEG WHITMAN COULD LEAVE THE COMPANY AS SOON AS THIS FALL. IMAGE SOURCE: HEWLETT-PACKARD ENTERPRISE.Before helping HPE turn around its business, Whitman served as CEO of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) for ten years, starting in 1998. When she departed in 2008, eBay's stock had climbed an impressive 186%. In addition, eBay had grown from 30 employees and $4 million in annual revenue to more than 15,000 employees and $8 billion in yearly revenue.In 2010, right before joining HPE, Whitman also made a foray into politics as the Republican Party's nominee for the gubernatorial race in California.During the company's most recent earnings call on Sept. 12, Whitman tried to put rumors of her leaving to rest, claiming that she was committed to helping HPE on its road to recovery.""I've dedicated the last six years of my life to this company, and there is more work to do,"" she said. ""And I'm here to help make this company successful, and I'm excited about the new strategy. So, lots more work to do, and I actually am not going anywhere.""However, in the same earnings call, Whitman did admit that she was at least enticed by the open CEO position at Uber after its former CEO Travis Kalanick stepped down in June. ""There has been some press,"" she said. ""Listen, I thought -- I was called in very late in the Uber search, and I thought it was a very interesting business model.""Whitman said that Uber and eBay are both disruptive companies that rely on communities, of drivers or sellers. She said that the growth prospects for Uber reminded her of eBay's early years. With a valuation of $68.5 billion, San Francisco-based Uber is the most highly valued private start-up in the world.The HPE CEO must have taken the Uber CEO search process seriously, considering she resigned as chairman of the HP Inc. board in late July, when she was first rumored to be among the candidates for the position.So why didn't Whitman take the Uber job? She claims that it wasn't the right position for her. ""I would say it really has nothing to do with HPE, which is quite special in its own right,"" she said during the earnings call.However, The New York Times reported that she told Uber board members on Aug. 27 the conditions under which she would accept the CEO position, and they decided against her, choosing Expedia's Dara Khosrowshahi instead. Whitman maintains that she only met with Uber as a courtesy.Whitman's ambition may be hitting a plateau at HPE. According to board intelligence solutions company Equilar, in 2014, the average S&P 500 CEO had served an average of 7.4 years and a median of 6.0 years.Managers who worked with Whitman in the past told the Journal they could see why she might be getting restless at HPE. When she came to the company in 2011, it had 350,000 employees and was reporting $127 billion in yearly revenue. Now, the shrunken company has 52,000 staff and $34 billion in annual revenue.In relationships, when one person is looking into other options, conventional wisdom says they already have one foot out the door. If Whitman is openly saying she considered Uber an ""interesting business model"" and met with its directors, shouldn't we assume she already has one foot out of HPE?10 stocks we like better than Hewlett Packard EnterpriseWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks That Are Ridiculously Cheap Right Now,"Jul 16, 2017 at 8:18PM","When a stock goes on sale, and the stock market offers you the chance to buy it for less than it's worth, that's what we investors call a ""value stock."" But what do you call a stock that's selling for a lot less than it's worth?Is it ridiculous to even ask that question in a market where everything seems expensive? Maybe, maybe not. Those of us who've been around the block a few times, though, have seen the stock market misprice great businesses again and again over the years -- and even in markets as pricey as this one. We've taken the opportunity to profit from these mistakes, so when we see a great bargain today, we're unafraid to go out on a limb and declare: These stocks are ridiculously cheap right now.Here are three such bargains that our investors think you should check out today: HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), Agenus (NASDAQ:AGEN), and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU).WHO ARE YOU CALLING RIDICULOUS? WHO ARE YOU CALLING CHEEP? IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.A market leader in a recovering industryLeo Sun (HP): PC sales rose year over year for the first time in five years during the first quarter of 2017, according to IDC. That 0.6% growth in shipments might seem anemic, but it dispels the notion that smartphones, tablets, and longer upgrade cycles will simply ""kill"" traditional PCs.That report was also great news for HP, which retook the title of the world's biggest PC maker from Lenovo after losing it four years ago. HP split with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) in late 2015, with the former retaining its PC, printing, and imaging businesses and the latter retaining the enterprise hardware and software units.HP sounds like a slow-growth stock, but its growth has been improving. Its personal Systems (PC) revenue rose 10% last quarter, as demand in the commercial and consumer markets improved. Double-digit sales growth in notebooks -- fueled by demand for higher-end devices and 2-in-1s -- offset a single-digit decline in desktop sales.Its printing revenue also rose 2% on the strength of commercial and consumer hardware. HP is beefing up that business with industrial 3D printers, and it will expand significantly once its acquisition of Samsung's printing business closes. HP's total revenue rose 7% annually, although its earnings dipped 2% on slightly lower margins.But looking ahead, analysts expect HP's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 4% and 3% this year as the PC and printing market warm up. The stock is still cheap at 12 times earnings, compared to the industry average P/E of 21 for PC makers. It also pays a generous dividend of 2.9%, which is easily supported by a payout ratio of 36%.This tiny biotech has enormous potential George Budwell (Agenus): The small-cap biotech Agenus is arguably ridiculously cheap right now because of its exposure to the ultra-high growth field of immuno-oncology. The condensed version is that Agenus has over 10 immuno-modulatory antibodies in either preclinical or clinical development at the moment across a variety of solid tumors. As an added layer of value, the drugmaker has also successfully licensed out a handful of these antibodies to Incyte Corp. and Merck & Co. -- illustrating the industry's immense interest in this rapidly emerging field of anti-cancer therapies.Getting to the heart of the matter, Agenus' present market cap of $427 million is dirt cheap for a company that sports a diverse pipeline of anti-cancer therapies and two major pharma partners to boot. While it's certainly true that the immuno-modulatory antibody field has attracted a large number of would-be competitors and it might be difficult to carve out a highly profitable niche as a result, the fact of the matter is that Agenus doesn't need any franchise-level drugs to emerge from this effort to be considered grossly undervalued.Even one drug capable of generating say $200 million in peak sales, for instance, is more than enough to create value for the company's shareholders. And that's a drop in the bucket for a therapeutic field that's forecast to generate somewhere along the lines of $35 billion in annual sales by 2022. In all, Agenus isn't guaranteed a spot at the high-value checkpoint inhibitor table, but it is working on a class of therapies with a proven track record in the clinic. So with such a diverse pipeline of potent anti-cancer therapies in development, there's a strong chance that this biotech will eventually produce at least a minor commercial-stage checkpoint inhibitor. And that's all this tiny biotech should need to produce respectable returns on capital for its early shareholders.  Wall Street is wrong, and Baidu is ridiculously cheapRich Smith (Baidu): In just a couple of weeks, Baidu.com -- ""the Chinese Google"" -- is due to report its fiscal second-quarter 2017 earnings. Wall Street thinks it will crash and burn, but it's wrong.Looking ahead to earnings last week, the bearish bankers at Bernstein blasted Baidu stock with a reiterated ""underperform,"" warning that unlike Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the U.S., Baidu runs a fragmented business where various units are ""walled off"" one from another and not currently supporting each other. If Alphabet can scrape data from a ""G-mail,"" and use it to better target an ad to a viewer on YouTube, well, Baidu can't currently do that. Bernstein also complains that Baidu is spending too much developing its Google-like moonshot ""O2O"" business, and it's eating up too much profit.But here's the thing: If Baidu isn't earning as much as it should be today, that's actually an argument in favor of the company being able to earn more tomorrow than it presently does, and thus grow its profits faster, once it gets around to integrating its businesses better. Similarly, investing in new businesses is exactly the thing you want to see a rich cash producer like Baidu do, in order to grow its earnings over time. In fact, this is probably one reason why most analysts who follow these internet tech giants see Google's parent company growing its earnings at ""only"" 19.4% annually over the next five years, while Baidu is expected to grow 5 percentage points faster -- 24.4%.This superior growth rate is the main reason I see Baidu stock as ridiculously cheap today, despite it carrying a higher P/E than does Alphabet. At last report, Baidu was generating free cash flow at the rate of $2.5 billion per year -- 53% better than its reported net income of $1.7 billion. That cash is piling up on Baidu's balance sheet, with the result that the stock, although valued at $64.8 billion in market capitalization, has an enterprise value of only $56.8 billion net of cash and debt.Result: Baidu stock currently sells for just 22.7 times free cash flow. And weighed against 24.4% expected growth, that gives Baidu stock an enterprise value-to-free cash flow ratio of only 0.9 -- which is cheaper than the 1.1 EV/FCF/growth ratio of Alphabet stock.Paying a cheaper valuation to own a piece of the dominant internet business in a country with an even bigger market than Google's... well, that seems a bit bonkers to me. Baidu stock is ridiculously cheap right now. I'd suggest buying some (and I already have)."
Better Buy: HP Inc. vs. Cisco Systems,"Aug 19, 2017 at 2:00PM","HP (NYSE:HPQ) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) are generally considered mature technology plays, which implies they offer income instead of growth. But over the past 12 months, HP has bucked expectations and rallied 30%, while Cisco has stayed nearly flat.Let's find out what fueled HP's rally, and what weighed Cisco down -- and see if those factors make the PC maker a better long-term play than the networking equipment specialist.SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.How do HP and Cisco make money?The ""old"" HP split in two in late 2015. HP retained the company's PC and printing businesses, while Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) retained its enterprise hardware and software businesses. Last quarter, 62% of HP's revenue came from PC sales, and 38% came from printers and imaging devices.Cisco is mainly known for selling networking routers and switches, which together generated 44% of its revenue last quarter. The rest comes from its security, wireless, collaboration, data center, and service provider video businesses. Its two highest-growth units are wireless and security -- together, they generated 11% of the company's revenue last quarter.How fast are HP and Cisco growing?Both HP and Cisco are slow-growth companies, but HP is growing faster. HP has posted three straight quarters of year-over-year sales growth, while Cisco's sales have fallen for seven straight quarters.HP's sales were buoyed by market-share gains in the PC market and steady demand for its printers. Gartner reports that although worldwide PC shipments have fallen annually for 11 straight quarters, HP has posted five straight quarters of growth -- which helped it reclaim its title as the world's top PC maker from Lenovo during the second quarter. Strong sales of HP's laptops offset weaker sales of desktops, especially in the U.S. market.THE HP SPECTRE X2. SOURCE: HP.Cisco's sales of routers and switches have been falling, due to the commoditization of the market and ongoing competition from generic ""white box"" networking hardware, which runs on open-source software. Its wireless and security businesses are posting positive growth, but they remain too small to offset the ongoing declines at its core businesses.Wall Street expects HP's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 4% and 3% in fiscal 2017 (which ends this October). Cisco just reported a 3% sales decline and 1% earnings growth for fiscal 2017 (which ended in July), and analysts expect its revenue and earnings to respectively rise 0.5% and 2.5% this year.How are HP and Cisco evolving?In previous years, HP's PC business struggled with long upgrade cycles and suffered from the rise of smartphones and tablets. But in recent quarters, HP's sleek Ultrabooks and 2-in-1 devices won back consumers. New, ""VR-ready"" desktops, like its Omen series, could also eventually boost desktop sales if VR games take off.As for its printing business, HP diversified into mobile printers for smartphones, industrial 3D printers, A3 copiers, and multifunction copiers. These devices can replace traditional printers and copiers. To boost its market share in A3 and multifunction copiers, the company agreed to acquire Samsung's printing business last September.Cisco is trying to counter the rise of white box solutions by launching its own cheaper hardware solutions, as well as repeatedly suing its biggest challenger in that market, Arista Networks. It's also acquiring a lot of companies to beef up its higher-growth wireless and security businesses -- it has bought or agreed to buy a dozen new companies since the beginning of 2016.Lastly, HP and Cisco keep most of their cash abroad, so proposed reductions to the 35% corporate tax rate, if they materialize, could enable both companies to bring their cash back to the U.S. for domestic acquisitions, buybacks, or dividend hikes.How do HP's and Cisco's dividends and valuations compare?Cisco currently pays a forward yield of 3.6%, which is comfortably supported by a payout ratio of 54%. HP pays a forward yield of 2.8%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 35%. Therefore, both companies have plenty of room for future hikes.Cisco currently trades at 16 times earnings, which is much lower than the industry average of 28 for communication equipment makers. HP has a P/E of just 13, which is also lower than the industry average of 21 for PC vendors.The winner: HPCisco pays a higher dividend, but HP's better growth rates and more visible tailwinds make it a better buy at current prices. HP's core PC and printing businesses will likely keep growing at slow and steady rates, whereas Cisco's routing and switching businesses face a murkier future with the disruptive rise of white box alternatives. Cisco is still a cheap income play with limited downside potential, but I believe that HP has more room to run."
What Happened in the Stock Market Today,"Sep 1, 2017 at 5:07PM","U.S. stocks inched higher yet again today despite a slightly weaker-than-expected jobs report. The country added 156,000 jobs last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, below average estimates for around 170,000, casting doubt on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve would begin reducing its balance sheet as expected later this month.Nonetheless, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) both mustered a small gain heading into the long weekend.Today's stock marketIndex Percentage Change Point ChangeDow 0.18% 39.46S&P 500 0.20% 4.90DATA SOURCE: YAHOO!

But this plunge wasn't due to some unfavorable business development. Rather, it was driven by the completion of a planned spinoff and merger of the enterprise computing specialist's non-core software assets with U.K.-based Micro Focus International (NASDAQOTH: MCFUF).The $8.8 billion deal was unveiled almost a year ago. Per its terms, HPE received a $2.5 billion cash payment, and its investors received 0.13732611 American depositary shares (ADSs) of Micro Focus for every HPE common share held as of its record date on Aug. 21, 2017. Based on Micro Focus' closing price at $29.50 per share yesterday, that equates almost exactly to the per-share ""decline"" we saw in HPE stock today. In short, the transaction is effectively a zero-sum game for HPE investors, who now hold roughly 222 million Micro Focus ADSs representing 50.1% of its fully diluted ordinary shares.""With the completion of this transaction,"" added HPE CEO Meg Whitman, ""HPE has achieved a major milestone in becoming a stronger, more focused company, purpose-built to compete and win in today's market.""Palo Alto Networks' beat and raiseShares of Palo Alto Networks rose 10.5% after the next-generation security platform company announced strong fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 results.

Both figures easily exceeded the company's latest guidance calling for revenue of $481 million to $491 million, and adjusted net income per share in the range of $0.78 to $0.80.Palo Alto Networks added around 3,000 new customers during the quarter -- its highest-ever total for any three-month period -- bringing its customer base to more than 42,500. During the subsequent conference call, CEO Mark McLaughlin noted new customer wins included an eight-figure replacement of Cisco products at one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, a seven-figure Check Point Software replacement at one of the largest banks in Australia, and a McAfee replacement on 40,000 endpoints at one of the United States' largest energy companies.Palo Alto Networks also increased its guidance for the full year, calling for fiscal 2018 revenue to grow between 21% and 23%, and for adjusted EPS of $3.24 to $3.34.

4 Things HPE Management Wants You to Know,"Sep 8, 2017 at 2:06PM","Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) had a surprisingly good 2017 third quarter for a tech company that has been weighed down in recent quarters by its plan to slim down its operations.The company reported earnings of $0.30 per share, topping estimates for $0.26 per share. Revenue also exceeded expectations at $8.21 billion versus consensus estimates for $7.49 billion. Shares of HPE closed down 1.96% to $13.77 on Wednesday.Investors could be focusing on HPE's tepid earnings forecast of $0.26 to $0.30 per share for the current quarter when previous estimates had pegged earnings at $0.40 per share. Also worrying is a Wall Street Journal report that claims people close to HPE CEO Meg Whitman said she could leave as soon as this fall. To get caught up on the company's transition plans, here are the four things you need to know from HPE's Tuesday afternoon earnings call.HEWLETT-PACKARD ENTERPRISE IS STILL SLIMMING DOWN BUT MANAGED TO POST A SOLID QUARTER.1. Meg Whitman will NOT be the CEO of Uber. Before Expedia's Dara Khosrowshahi became CEO of Uber, HPE CEO Meg Whitman's name was being thrown around in the media as a possible replacement for former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who resigned in June after the company's scandalous start to 2017. On July 27, Uber investor Whitman denied the rumors in a tweet that read: ""We have a lot of work still to do at HPE and I am not going anywhere. Uber's CEO will not be Meg Whitman."" Whitman once again voiced her commitment to HPE during the company's earnings call. She admitted that she was called into the Uber CEO search pool ""very late"" but thought it was ""a very interesting business model"" and a ""disruptive"" company. In the end, Whitman said it wasn't the right position for her. I've dedicated the last 6 years of my life to this company, and there is more work to do. And I'm here to help make this company successful, and I'm excited about the new strategy. So lots more work to do, and I actually am not going anywhere.However, Whitman did not specify how long she planned to stay at HPE. As mentioned previously, sources told the Wall Street Journal that Whitman has already started to plan for her exit, which could happen as soon as this fall. This is notable as Whitman has been leading HPE's turnaround efforts for the past six years.2. Hurricane Harvey could have an impact on HPE's financials. Hurricane Harvey, which ripped through Texas and Louisiana last week, has had a ""substantial impact"" on HPE's Houston operations, HPE CFO Timothy Stonesifer said on the call. While he said the safety of its employees is the company's top priority, it is still assessing the impact on its business. The company has limited production in the city and was able to ship products for customers to other locations so that orders could be fulfilled, he noted. ""Of course, we will bear uninsured costs associated with lost inventory or repairs to our campus but have not incorporated anything into our outlook at this time,"" Stonesifer concluded. 3. The company is still slimming down. On Friday, the Palo Alto-based business took a major step forward in its slim-down plan by officially closing the spin-off and merger of its software business with British software company Micro Focus in an $8.8 billion deal.Now that the company is smaller, it can focus on creating a ""simpler, nimbler and faster"" operating model, Whitman claimed. The first step in this direction is its HPE Next program, which was announced in June and aims to simplify its entire operations.Whitman explained the purpose of HPE Next on the earnings call:We aim to go into FY '18 with a clean sheet operating model, in a way that I hope customers will see a difference right away. . . If you think about what was required to hold this company together when it was a very large multi-business company, some of those ways of doing business we need to let go of.4. HPE will continue to invest in these three areas. HPE may be slimming down, but it's also making wiser investments that are in-line with its simpler business model because ""innovation is our lifeblood,"" Whitman said on the call. The company will be focusing on investing in three areas: cybersecurity, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI). These are three areas that are expected to show tremendous growth, with spending on AI projected to hit $46 billion by 2020. In addition, the IoT is expected to be a $300 billion market by 2020, according to the Boston Consulting Group, while the cybersecurity market is expected to reach $232 billion by 2022.HPE isn't wasting any time on investing in these areas. On Tuesday, the company announced that it bought Boston-based Cloud Technology Partners (CTP), which has worked with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and the cloud platform for Google, owned by Alphabet. CTP helps clients move the appropriate applications to public and private clouds and it helps them develop new tools for the cloud by using big data and IoT. Amazon Web Services is still the leader in the public cloud space. For the past quarter, AWS generated $916 million in operating income on $4.1 billion in revenue. That represents a 42% year-over-year increase in revenue. On the earnings call, Whitman said that CTP will help boost the company's consulting capabilities. 10 stocks we like better than Hewlett Packard EnterpriseWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Horrible Stocks for Retirees,"Oct 27, 2017 at 9:02AM","Retirees in search of investment opportunities generally try to avoid stocks that have been experiencing wild price swings, companies struggling through significant transitions, or businesses focused on markets where there's little to no growth potential.Plenty of companies do fit those descriptions, so finding stocks that are a bad fit for retirees' portfolios wasn't a difficult process. Three in particular  that I feel should be avoided by those basking in their retirements are Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), and Fitbit (NYSE:FIT).IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Sky-high spendingUsually the first thing Palo Alto bulls -- and there are a lot of them -- point to when justifying their position is the company's top line. Last quarter, it generated $509.1 million in revenue, good for a 27% year-over-year jump.However, revenue growth is expected to slow to the 21% to 24% range this quarter, putting the top line somewhere between $482 million and $492 million. But the network and enterprise security company's slowing growth isn't what makes its  stock so horrible for retirees: It's the company's continued, rampant spending.Last quarter's operating expenses were $397.9 million, a staggering 24% increase from Palo Alto's already sky-high spending the year before. The largest expense category was sales costs, which hit a jaw-dropping $245.4 million, nearly half Palo Alto's revenue. Not surprisingly, it reported a $0.42-per-share loss, 20% worse than last year's loss of $0.35 a share. Wild price swings and mounting losses? Not a winning combination for retirees, who are more interested in stability.Batting .500It was big news when HP Inc. split from Hewlett-Packard Enterprise two years ago, and rightfully so given that the company was a tech pioneer. The move has paid big dividends for HP Inc., which is now over-delivering in nearly every facet of its PC and printing businesses. The same can't be said for HP Enterprise.Granted, HP Enterprise has been put through a series of further changes since it was split off, including selling its enterprise services unit and a large part of its software assets. The costs associated with those sales and the ongoing restructuring continue to weigh on its quarterly results, which CEO Meg Whitman is quick to point out.Unfortunately, the restructuring and other expenses aren't new and will continue to impact HP Enterprise's financials in the foreseeable future. The results is that HP Enterprise's costs and expenses will continue to climb as they did last quarter to $8 billion, well above the $5.36 billion a year ago.Factor in that the company plans to cut another 5,000 jobs -- 10% of its workforce -- and one can see that, two years into its transition, HP Enterprise's plans to lead the cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) market aren't working. Based on its shares' 39% drop in value this year, I'm not the only one who has lost confidence in HP Enterprise. Retirees don't need this stock in their portfolio.Running in placeFitbit has had its share of hiccups over the past year, most notably when it failed to meet sales expectations for its fitness trackers, which left it with massive inventory surplus it's just now beginning to manage. As disappointing as Fitbit's 40% drop in quarterly revenue to $353.3 million in the most recent quarter was, the reason behind the nosedive is what's really concerning.Sales in the U.S -- where Fitbit gets more than half its revenue -- were $199 million in the second quarter. Problem is, that domestic revenue number reflected an eye-popping 55% year-over-year decline. Fitbit thinks it may have a solution: its new Ionic smartwatch. As per CEO James Park, the device will be on store shelves before the all-important holiday sales season.Thing is, casting a line into the smartwatch pool isn't likely to be the answer to Fitbit's woes. The number of fitness devices it sold last quarter (3.4 million)  was well below the 5.7 million it moved a year ago, and now the company thinks its salvation lies in going head-to-head with Apple, the only smartwatch manufacturer showing any signs of success? Fitbit's horrendous sales trend, combined with a strategy that's based on entering the wrong market well behind its competitors, explains why this is a stock retirees seeking stability and growth should avoid."
"1 Reason to Buy AMD Stock, and 1 Reason to Avoid It","Oct 16, 2017 at 4:33PM","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has made significant inroads into the central processing unit (CPU) and the graphics processing unit (GPU) markets by taking the fight to Intel and NVIDIA. The company is now enjoying substantial market share in both of these areas, which has translated into robust revenue and margin growth.AMD data by YChartsNot surprisingly, Wall Street has rewarded AMD handsomely as its shares have soared over 90% in the past year. There's one good reason to believe that AMD can sustain its impressive run -- the success of its products in the fast-growing server market. However, there's a potential hurdle to AMD's near-term success -- the failure of its Vega graphics cards.IMAGE SOURCE: AMD.The server market could be a big deal for AMDAMD is currently engaged in a battle for server supremacy against both Intel and NVIDIA. The company claims that its EPYC server CPUs can defeat the best of Intel's offerings in terms of efficiency and performance. It looks like data center customers have bought into AMD's claims, as EPYC launched in late June with backing from several big server players, including leading cloud service providers such as Baidu and Microsoft, which have already announced deployments of the new chips across their data center platforms. Looking ahead, AMD's EPYC chips could find their way into more servers given a strong partner ecosystem that includes Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Dell, Samsung, and others.Furthermore, AMD seems to have made significant headway into the Chinese data center space by roping in infrastructure providers such as Lenovo and Sugon. Additionally, the likes of JD.com and Tencent have also committed to using AMD's EPYC chips in their data centers. All these partnerships in China could be a big deal for AMD in the long run as the country's data center market is estimated to grow at 13% a year until 2021.But AMD's gains in this space won't be limited to the EPYC server chips, since its server GPUs seem to be gaining traction as well. AMD recently scored a big win when cloud services leader Amazon Web Services announced that it will use the former's FirePro server GPUs and the multi-user GPU technology in the Graphics Design instance of its AppStream 2.0 service.This is a big coup for AMD as Amazon has traditionally been a NVIDIA customer. In fact, Amazon uses the Tesla GPUs from NVIDIA to power the two other instances of the AppStream service.This breakthrough in server GPUs could be a big deal for AMD as the server GPU accelerator market could be worth at least $4.5 billion in 2022, according to Ark Invest. This is almost equal to AMD's revenue in the past 12 months, which means that it can nicely boost its revenue going forward.NVIDIA could cut AMD to sizeAMD's rise has been primarily driven by the company's GPU market-share gains against NVIDIA. At the end of the second quarter, AMD had almost 30% of the GPU market at its disposal, which is a bump over the 21% share it enjoyed at the end of 2015.AMD has managed to claw back such substantial market share from NVIDIA thanks to its strategy of selling value-for-money GPUs, which allowed it to capture a greater share of the mid- and entry-level market. But AMD might find it hard to replicate this in the premium GPU market, as its recently released Vega chips have been found to be wanting against NVIDIA.Independent tests indicate that AMD's Vega GPUs can't significantly outperform NVIDIA's rival offerings, which were launched more than a year ago. For instance, the RX Vega 64 and the RX Vega 56 consume more power to deliver an identical performance to NVIDIA's GTX 1080 and GTX 1070. One more problem with the Vega cards is that they don't undercut the NVIDIA offerings on pricing, either, limiting their chances of succeeding in the high-end market.Furthermore, NVIDIA is reportedly preparing a souped-up version of the GTX 1070 -- the GTX 1070 Ti -- to counter the lower-priced RX Vega 56. Leaked specs suggest that the new card could be as powerful as the GTX 1080 with a base clock speed of 1607 MHz and a boost clock speed of 1683 MHz. It could retail at a compelling price of $430 when it goes on sale at the end of October.By comparison, the AMD RX Vega 56 has a retail price of $399, but it has a lower clock speed range of 1156 MHz to 1471 MHz. Therefore, performance-oriented enthusiasts are unlikely to have a problem in paying the extra $31 for a more powerful card.The Foolish bottom lineAMD has been successfully lapped up the low-hanging fruit in the GPU market and built up its market share. The company is now looking to accelerate its growth by moving into the lucrative server space, where the likes of Intel and NVIDIA currently hold sway. But investors shouldn't be surprised if AMD stock takes a tumble as its rivals could start coming up with competitively priced products to arrest its rise. "
2 Terrible Stocks for Retirees,"Dec 20, 2017 at 4:32PM","There's certainly nothing wrong with retirees looking for stocks that offer growth over the long haul, but some simply aren't suitable. Stagnant to no growth, wild price fluctuations, and poor or uncertain management are some company attributes many retirees especially want to avoid.Unfortunately for Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) shareholders, those companies meet the criteria of being two terrible stocks for retirees. Continual changes, including HP Enterprise's recent decision to replace CEO Meg Whitman, is a legitimate cause for uncertainty. Groupon has taken shareholders on a wild ride that doesn't appear to be nearing an end anytime soon.IMAGE SOURCE: HP ENTERPRISE.Change isn't always goodAfter a bevy of grumblings from pundits to replace HP Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman, she has decided to step down on Feb. 1, 2018. Whitman's successor will be longtime Hewlett-Packard engineer Antonio Neri. The CEO swap is hardly the only change at the top. HP Enterprise has also hired new CIO Archie Deskus to manage the next sweeping IT restructuring.Let's not forget HP Enterprise's decision earlier this year to sell off an entire division and large chunks of another. The result of its slew of ongoing changes has been a mere 7% rise in share price in 2017. Though HP Enterprise's financial results aren't terrible, the many questions surrounding its ""new"" direction, which comes on the heels of its existing ""new"" direction, are red flags.Last quarter's $7.7 billion in revenue was a 4.6% increase compared to 2016, but HP Enterprise's fiscal year wasn't as positive. HP Enterprise generated revenue of $28.9 billion for the fiscal year, down 4.7%. Unfortunately, due to multiple restructurings, unit sales, and other changes, comparing the HP Enterprise of today with past results will be an ongoing challenge.As an example, a big part of the 17% jump in operating expenses last quarter to $7.78 billion was the costs for separation, transformation, and acquisitions. Combined, the three expense line items totaled a whopping $643 million. For some perspective, last year those same line items totaled ""just"" $292 million. Change can be good, but HP Enterprise's continual efforts to find a winning formula make it a terrible stock for retirees looking for stability.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Anything you can doAn ""economic moat"" in the world of investing is used to describe the difficulty, or relative ease, with which competitors are able to offer solutions similar to what an existing provider can. Based on Groupon's growing number of competitors, including Ebates and RetailMeNot, to name but a couple, Groupon's economic moat is bordering on nonexistent.Its competitors' aggressive discounting has pressured Groupon's top line, as last quarter's 9% drop in revenue to $634.5 million demonstrates. Groupon's answer to the lack of growth includes moving away from its lower-margin goods business to focus on its local unit. Another step Groupon is taking to jump-start sales is spending more on marketing.Though sales, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were down 8%to $214 million, marketing costs rose 20% in the third quarter to $101.5 million. Despite paring SG&A expenses, the increase in marketing spend means total expenses were essentially flat year over year. Clearly, Groupon's efforts to ""drive operating efficiency"" haven't taken hold.Net income was $3.8 million last quarter, but it also included a net $5.6 million gain from an asset sale; otherwise, it would have been another loss, just as it was a year ago. The end result was that per-share earnings, excluding one-time items, were $0.01 a share, the same as 2016's third quarter.Groupon's topsy-turvy results and growing competition has meant a roller-coaster ride for shareholders. In the past 52 weeks, Groupon stock has traded as high as $5.99 and as low as $2.90 a share. The more than 50% swing in value in a year isn't ideal for any conservative investor, retired or not.The continual highs and lows, lack of revenue growth, and little to no economic moat are why Groupon joins HP Enterprise as a terrible stock for retirees.10 stocks we like better than GrouponWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The 3 Best Server Companies to Buy in 2017,"Jun 14, 2017 at 3:46PM","The global server market isn't the most flashy part of the technology industry, but it is one of the most important sectors in all of tech. Whether physical or cloud-based, servers are the backbone of modern computing. Without them, our tech-laden world could not exist.That's why the companies that make servers can be steady, reliable investments. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are three prominent names to consider in this space. Let's take a closer look at them.International Business MachinesThe shift from physical servers to cloud-computing products is one of the biggest trends in the server market today. It's also the reality for IT giant IBM.IBM saw its server sales decline 22% from $7.5 billion in 2015 to $5.9 billion in 2016. The company is in the third year of the sales cycle for its z13 mainframe server, and it emphasized that it continued to add server clients in 2016. However, in fiscal 2016 alone, cloud service revenue rose 49%, from roughly $3.9 billion to $5.9 billion, more than compensating for the revenue decline in physical servers.Of course, selling cloud services involves increasing the number of its own servers in use. It's just that the physical servers are separated from the cloud-computing software, which changes the sales model but not the computing product being delivered. So IBM's revenue model will always be connected to the server market, even as the way it sells its computing power changes along with the rest of the industry in the years to come.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGESHewlett-Packard EnterpriseServers are the largest revenue driver for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, the largest server producer by market share. Their sales accounted for $14 billion  of its $50.1 billion in total 2016 sales.Hewlett-Packard Enterprise has so far weathered the changes in the server industry better than expected, as server sales for the IT giant fell just 0.7% in fiscal 2016. However, some of the long-term trends affecting the sector may be catching up with it, as server sales declined 14% year over year, from $3.5 billion to $2.9 billion, in  the most recent quarterly report.The bigger problem is that the company lacks a dedicated cloud suite of products like IBM does. IBM can hope to hold on to many of its customer relationships by transitioning their solutions from physical servers to cloud computing as a service. Whether Hewlett-Packard Enterprise can figure out a similar solution will be the thing for investors to watch in the coming years.IntelThe world's largest chipmaker rules over the server market; estimates of its share of server market microprocessors hover around 99%. So the company stands a great chance of continuing to print profits from the computing infrastructure space, even as the way computing is delivered changes.That's great news, because Intel's data-center group, which represents the company's server sales, produced a 43% operating margin in fiscal 2016. This segment has, however, seen its operating margin decline from as high as 50% in 2014, a drop that Intel seems to pin on increased operating expenses.  If that's so, it implies that the company hasn't lost its top-line pricing power. That seems like a possibility, as leading cloud companies such as Amazon.com, Alphabet, and others could seek volume discounts for their server chips. Investors will want to keep an eye on this trend, but there's little doubt that Intel is one the most indispensable companies in the server market today.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here's Why Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Jumped 13% Last Month,"Mar 8, 2018 at 11:58AM","What happenedHewlett Packard Enterprise's (NYSE:HPE) shares jumped 13.4% in February, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, after the company released its first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings report that included the announcement of an upcoming $7 billion share repurchase plan and dividend increase.So whatInvestors were likely pleased to hear that HP would return $7 billion to shareholders in its fiscal year 2019, through a 50% dividend increase that starts in the third-quarter fiscal 2018, and through share repurchases. This follows a previous dividend increase the company announced toward the end of last year.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.HP shareholders probably also appreciated the fact that the company's sales grew by 11% in the fourth quarter, to $7.7 billion, which outpaced Wall Street's consensus revenue estimate of about $7.07 billion. The company beat earnings estimates in the quarter as well, delivering non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.34, compared to analysts' consensus estimate of $0.22.Now whatHP's shares have made a modest gain of just over 2% in March, but it's unclear whether or not investors will continue their optimism in the coming months. HP's management said that non-GAAP diluted earnings per share will be in the range of $0.29 to $0.33 in the second quarter, which could represent a significant decrease from the $0.35 per share the company earned in the year ago quarter.

Why Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. Stock Popped on Friday,"Feb 23, 2018 at 2:50PM","What happenedShares of business-intelligence and technology-solutions company Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) jumped as much as 10.8% on Friday, following the company's first-quarter results for fiscal 2018, as well as the announcement of a $7 billion capital return and a significant dividend increase. The stock is up about 10% at the time of this writing.Though the company's significant capital return program and higher-than-expected first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share may have played key roles in investor optimism toward the stock on Friday, another notable takeaway from the earnings report is HPE's strong guidance.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.So whatHPE's fourth-quarter revenue was $7.7 billion, up 11% year over year and significantly higher than a consensus analyst estimate for revenue of about $7.1 billion. First-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.34 were similarly up nicely, rising from $0.28 in the year-ago quarter. On average, analysts were expecting non-GAAP EPS of just $0.22.For the full year of fiscal 2018, HPE management said it expected non-GAAP EPS to be between $1.35 and $1.45, well ahead of a consensus analyst estimate for $1.18 during this period.Now whatHPE's confidence in its strategy and execution was highlighted by its strong guidance, but was also demonstrated in the company's robust capital return program and meaningful enhancements to its employee perks.""We now plan to return $7 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends by the end of FY19, including a 50% increase in our dividend,"" said HPE CEO Antonio Neri.

Why Hewlett Packard Enterprise Shares Popped 14% Last Month,"Feb 13, 2018 at 2:25PM","What happenedShares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) jumped 14.2% in January, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, after a positive investor note from Morgan Stanley, which included an upgrade rating from overweight to equal weight.So whatInvestors were pleased to hear Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty say that Hewlett Packard Enterprise could see earnings and revenue growth due to increased spending in the coming years. Huberty believes that recent tax reform changes for companies in the U.S. will free up cash for Hewlett, which it will then use for more information technology spending.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.""In light of enterprises underspending on IT over the past two decades and the related degradation in US productivity growth, we see a bull case of several years of stronger enterprise IT growth,"" Huberty wrote.Huberty also increased her price target for the company from $14 to $19, which helped improve investor sentiment for Hewlett Packard's stock.Now whatInvestors haven't been as optimistic for Hewlett Packard this month, but that might have more to do with volatility in the overall stock market.

Is HP Inc. a Turnaround Buy?,"Mar 2, 2018 at 11:45AM","After being left for dead, HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) has surprised most investors with its strong turnaround. When it was announced that Hewlett-Packard would split into two companies, HP Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), investors had low expectations for the computer maker.The reason for the split was to allow HPE to ""unlock value"" by trading for expanded multiples, once that company no longer had the burden of its low-growth consumer hardware divisions. If there were any doubts as to which post-split company management assigned higher expectations to, they were answered by then-CEO Meg Whitman, who assumed the CEO role at HPE.IMAGE SOURCE: HP INC.While management said that the split would allow HP Inc. to focus on product innovation, many were initially critical of this assertion, as innovation should have been unaffected by the presence of the enterprise business. Additionally, HP Inc.'s management pledged that approximately 75% of free cash flow payout would be returned to shareholders, signaling that payouts to investors would be emphasized over research and development. But this bearishness has been misplaced: HP Inc. has doubled the return of the S&P 500.HPQ DATA BY YCHARTS.PCs are leading the way but printing could be a game-changerPost-split, it's been HP's personal systems that have helped the company's top line. In the last reported quarter, HP Inc. increased divisional revenue 15%, for the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. While ultrapremium notebooks like Envy and Spectre have received the bulk of the credit for HP's reinvention, in the last quarter the company's desktop line of computers grew at a 17% clip.Innovation has increased, with the company receiving 77 awards for innovation at January's Consumer Electronics Show. For full-year 2017, HP reclaimed the title as top PC maker, and one of only three major PC makers to post year-on-year sales increases.The company's other division, printing, slightly underperformed personal systems last quarter; it posted a 14% year-on-year top-line increase, but its recent forays into 3D printing could be a large runway for growth. Recently, the company partnered with French 3D software company Dassault Systemes. In the company's earnings report it noted that its 3D customer list included FedEx and the U.S. Marine Corps.Should you buy?Despite HP Inc.'s strong stock performance, shares of the company are still considered cheap. The overall S&P 500 is valued at 17.5 times forward earnings; HP trades at only 12. Additionally, shares now trade hands with a dividend yield of 2.5%, over 60 basis points more than the index. It should be noted that the forward earnings estimate is from Thomson Reuters analyst consensus, which estimates $1.95 per share while the company is guiding for 2018 earnings per share to be $2.58 at the midpoint.While it's normal for hardware makers to trade at discounts to the greater market (Apple's forward price-to-earnings ratio is 13.5), HP Inc. appears to be undervalued considering its recent record of growth, shareholder-friendly capital return policy, and potential long-term growth catalyst of 3D printing. Investors looking for a turnaround story should put HP Inc. on their watchlist, and watch the company's 3D printing efforts closely.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In January, shares of the computer and printing manufacturer rose 11%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, building upon 2017's strong performance.So whatIn 2015, the company that was then Hewlett-Packard performed a stock split separating its enterprise-focused operations, industrial servers, software, and networking equipment from the consumer-focused laptop-PC and printer business.The former, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), was widely considered the healthier, growth-oriented company (unsurprisingly, Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman became the CEO of HPE) while HP Inc., stripped of its name, was considered a secular declining legacy business under attack from mobile smartphones.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGESIt was argued the breakup would allow HP Inc. to innovate and win market share, but the announcement also noted it would return 50% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders, a classic corporate strategy in a declining/no-growth market. Last year was the exact opposite: HP Inc. stock rose 42% on the back of 8% year-on-year revenue growth, while HPE's stock produced a modest 7% return. Meg Whitman, the brain trust behind the corporate split, stepped down from HPE after a disappointing fourth quarter.HPQ DATA BY YCHARTSNow whatIn January, investors received more positive news about HP. As my colleague Leo Sun points out, last year HP led the world in PC shipments, according to data from Gartner Inc. Additionally, HP posted the strongest PC shipment growth of major companies, increasing total shipments by 4.6%, making it one of only three major PC manufacturers to post year-on-year growth -- the other two being Apple and Dell.In fiscal 2017, HP grew revenue from personal systems (computers) 11% over the prior year. While the company's printing business didn't grow at the same pace as personal systems, 3D printing could be its next catalyst for growth.Despite a strong 2017, shares of HP Inc. are still cheaply valued. Currently, the company trades at 11 times earnings, versus the greater S&P 500's multiple of 16 times. In addition, the company has a dividend yield of 2.8%, 90 basis points greater than the S&P 500.

4 Reasons to Love HP Inc.'s First Quarter,"Feb 28, 2018 at 7:05PM","Shares of HP (NYSE:HPQ) jumped on Feb. 23, after the PC and printer maker posted first-quarter earnings that topped analyst estimates. Revenue grew 14% annually to $14.5 billion, beating expectations by $1 billion and marking its strongest quarterly growth since it split with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise in late 2015. Non-GAAP earnings rose 26% to $0.48 per share, topping expectations by $0.06 and representing its highest quarterly profit in six quarters.Those headline numbers were solid, but there were four other reasons to love HP's report.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Growth in the PC businessDuring the quarter, HP's personal systems revenue rose 15% annually to $9.4 billion, marking its fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. That was impressive, considering the unit faced a tough comparison to its 10% annual growth in the prior-year quarter.Sales of commercial and consumer PCs rose 16% and 13%, respectively. Total shipments grew 7%, with notebook shipments rising 8% and desktop shipments climbing 6%.HP'S SPECTRE X2. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.HP finished the quarter with a 23.5% share of the global market, a 1.7 percentage-point jump from a year earlier and good enough to secure its position as the world's the top PC vendor. HP was also one of three companies -- the other two being Dell and Apple -- that achieved positive growth during the quarter. The other three leading vendors -- Lenovo, Asus, and Acer -- posted flat to negative growth.CEO Dion Weisler attributed that growth to ""amazing design, innovation, and a consistent focus on leveraging customer insights to create and deliver experiences that amaze.""Indeed, HP won 77 awards for innovation at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, and it continues to launch notable new devices -- including a new 15-inch Spectre x360 convertible PC, the HP Pavilion Wave compact desktop with the Alexa digital assistant built in, the enterprise-oriented EliteBook 800 notebook series, and Omen gaming PCs.Growth in the printing businessHP's Printing revenue rose 14% annually to $5.1 billion, as its total hardware shipments climbed 14%. Commercial hardware shipments surged 73%, consumer hardware shipments rose 7%, and supplies revenue advanced 10%.The big jump in commercial revenue came from HP's acquisition of Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) printing unit, which closed on Nov. 1. That acquisition significantly boosts HP's market share in A3 printers and scales up its A4 printer business.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The printing business also posted year-over-year growth in graphics and managed print services revenues. The graphics business benefited from strong demand for its Indigo and PageWide presses, while its managed print business benefited from a market shift toward contractual printing services.HP's 3D printing business, which targets industrial customers, also continues to evolve. The company recently introduced a new low-cost color 3D printer for creating engineering-grade prototypes in multiple colors, making HP the only 3D printing company that provides both prototyping and industrial production capabilities on a single technological platform. HP also plans to expand into other 3D printing markets, including metal printing, in the near future.Stable operating marginMany PC makers' margins have declined in recent quarters, because of the rising costs of hardware components such as memory chips. Likewise, the operating margin in HP's personal systems unit slipped 0.2 percentage points annually to 3.6% during the quarter, but robust revenue growth offset the decline.CFO Catherine Lesjak anticipates ""increased component costs"" throughout the year, especially in DRAM prices, but plans to offset those costs by raising prices, leveraging the scale of HP's supply chain, tweaking its product mix toward higher-margin products, and riding currency tailwinds in certain markets. Memory prices are also cyclical -- so when the downturn finally starts, HP's PC margins will quickly expand again.The printing unit's operating margin slipped 0.2 percentage points to 15.8%, but that dip is a temporary one caused by the ongoing integration of S-Print, the Samsung printing unit. Once that integration concludes, the increased scale should significantly boost margin.Rosy guidance and a low valuationHP expects 12.5%-22.5% earnings growth during the second quarter, which easily beats the consensus estimate for 10% growth. For the full year, HP anticipates 15%-21% earnings growth -- which also crushes Wall Street's forecast for 10% growth.HP stock currently trades at just 11 times this year's earnings. When we combine that figure with its forward yield of 2.6%, and assuming HP hits the midpoint of its earnings guidance for 2018 of $1.95 per share, HP seems like a rock-solid investment for conservative income investors.The bottom lineI've repeatedly stated that the ""new"" HP is a great long-term investment, since its evolving PC business is leaving rivals in the dust as its printing business scales up and enters new markets. HP might initially seem like a dull, slow-growth stock, but its double-digit revenue and earnings growth during the first quarter indicates that it could still have a lot more room to run."
2 Top Computer Stocks to Buy Now -- And 1 to Avoid,"Feb 6, 2018 at 3:36PM","Over the past decade, the rise of smartphones and tablets has disrupted the market for traditional PCs. Longer-lasting hardware has also extended upgrade cycles, and PC makers saw their sales slow to a trickle.Between 2007 and 2017 annual worldwide PC shipments fell from 271.2 million units to 262.5 million units according to research firm Gartner. Annual shipments have also fallen for six straight years, causing many investors to shun the stocks of PC makers.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.But if we look closer at Gartner's market share growth figures for 2017, we'll notice that some PC makers are faring much better than others.Company2017 ShipmentsYear-Over-Year GrowthTotal Market ShareHP55.2 million4.6%21%Lenovo54.7 million(2.2%)20.8%Dell39.9 million1.1%15.2%Apple19.3 million4.1%7.4%Asus18.0 million(12.3%)6.8%Acer Group17.1 million(6.5%)6.5%Others58.4 million(9.7%)22.3%SOURCE: GARTNER.HP (NYSE:HPQ), Dell, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are clearly gaining ground at the expense of their rivals. HP, which reclaimed its title as the world's top PC maker from Lenovo last year, is experiencing robust demand for its new high-end ultrabooks and convertible devices, especially in North America.Dell, which is struggling against HP in the US market, offset that softness with overseas growth. Meanwhile, Apple continues to rule the non-Windows PC market with its premium Mac products.Today I'll highlight the top three stocks to buy in the PC market, and one related stock which investors should avoid.Top stock to buy: HPAfter splitting with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise in late 2015, HP became a more streamlined company with just two businesses -- PCs and printers. Prior to the split, HP mostly focused on budget devices.But after the split, HP chased Apple into the premium market with well-received devices like the Spectre, and followed Microsoft's Surface with new 2-in-1 devices. It also launched new high-end gaming PCs and more secure systems for enterprise customers.HP'S SPECTRE X2. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.All those moves lifted HP's total PC shipments 6% annually during the fourth quarter, boosting the business' revenues by 13% to $9.1 billion. That marked an acceleration from its 12% growth in the third quarter and 10% growth in the second quarter. HP's PC operating margin remains under pressure due to cyclically high component costs (especially flash memory), but those pressures should wane over the next two years.Meanwhile, HP's printing business also remains healthy thanks to strong sales of its consumer printers and printing supplies. HP is also expanding that business by expanding into new markets like mobile printers and industrial 3D printers and acquiring Samsung's printing unit, which will boost its market share in multifunction A3 printers. Wall Street expects HP's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 4% and 10% for the full year, and the stock still trades at a reasonable 12 times forward earnings.Top stock to buy: AppleApple generates most of its revenue from the iPhone, but Mac revenues still accounted for 8% of its top line last quarter. Its Mac shipments and revenue both fell 5% annually during the quarter, but that was partly due to the lack of a new MacBook -- Apple instead launched its new iMac Pro in mid-December, closer to the end of the first quarter.THE IMAC PRO. IMAGE SOURCE: APPLE.But during the conference call, Apple CFO Luca Maestri noted that 60% of its Mac sales were ""first time buyers and switchers"" from Windows PCs, with a 90% conversion rate in China. Maestri also noted that Mac sales in emerging markets grew 13% annually with ""all-time records"" in Latin America, India, Turkey, Central America, and Europe.The Mac, along with the iPhone and iPad, remain Apple's three pillars of growth as it gradually expands its software services business, which posted 18% annual sales growth last quarter and accounted for 10% of its top line.Looking ahead, analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 18% and 25% this year -- solid growth numbers for a stock that trades at just 13 times forward earnings.One stock to avoid: IntelSince chipmaker Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) x86 CPUs power the majority of PCs worldwide, it seems like an obvious play on rebounding PC sales. The company's 4% year-over-year sales growth and 37% jump in non-GAAP earnings last quarter -- which both beat analyst estimates -- also seem healthy.Unfortunately, Intel's long-term growth is overshadowed by some serious security concerns. The recent Spectre and Meltdown flaws, which expose all modern Intel CPUs to hardware-level hacks, caused many companies to question their safety. Intel's ""patch"" then caused so many issues that Microsoft disabled the update, warning that it could ""cause data loss or corruption"".Intel CEO Brian Krzanich also reportedly sold half his stock after being informed about the flaws but before making them public. The Wall Street Journal then claimed that Intel informed Chinese tech companies about the chip flaws before investors, the US government, or the public.All this controversy leaves Intel vulnerable to its main rival, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), which recently claimed that its new Zen 2 architecture would be fully protected from Spectre and Meltdown. AMD previously stated that its current-gen chips weren't vulnerable to Meltdown, and were only vulnerable to certain versions of Spectre.Analysts expect Intel to post just 3% sales growth and 2% earnings growth this year, but those estimates could still be too high if AMD gains ground.The key takeawaysThe PC market is a tough one to thrive in, but HP and Apple are gaining ground at the expense of their rivals. However, investors should be mindful of laggards like Lenovo, which is weighed down by its weak mobile business, and seemingly solid suppliers like Intel, which faces tough questions about its management decisions and competitive threats."
How HP Inc. Keeps Crushing its PC Rivals,"Jan 24, 2018 at 11:33AM","HP (NYSE:HPQ), the top PC maker in the world, is pulling further ahead of its top rivals, according to IDC's latest market share figures. Between the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2017, HP's global market share grew from 21.8% to 23.5%.HP was followed by Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY), Dell, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Asus, and Acer Group, in that order. Out of the top six PC makers, only HP, Dell, and Apple posted annual growth in shipments. HP's shipments rose 8.3% to 16.6 million, Apple's grew 7.3% to 5.8 million, and Dell's inched up 0.7% to 11.1 million.HP'S SPECTRE X2. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.Simply put, HP is crushing its rivals in the PC market, which is approaching an inflection point. Total PC shipments rose 0.7% annually during the quarter, marking the industry's first positive holiday quarter in six years.Understanding HP's comebackBefore HP split with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise in late 2015, its aging PC business was stuck in a rut. Lenovo, which acquired IBM's PC business in 2005, overtook HP as the world's top PC vendor in 2012 on robust demand for its cheap laptops.But after splitting with HPE, HP focused on challenging Apple in the premium laptop market with high-end devices like the Spectre, and followed Microsoft's Surface with premium 2-in-1 devices. It also launched more high-end gaming PCs and secure systems for enterprise customers.Thanks to those efforts, HP enjoyed a sharp recovery in the North American market at the expense of its rivals. In early 2017, HP reclaimed its crown from Lenovo, which saw its sales flatline on soft demand in its home market of China.How strong is HP's PC business?HP's Personal Systems (PC) revenue rose 13% annually to $9.1 billion during its fiscal fourth quarter, as its total shipments rose 6%. This marked an acceleration from the unit's 12% revenue growth during the third quarter.During the fourth quarter, HP's notebook shipments and revenues respectively rose 8% and 16%. Desktop shipments also improved 2% with 10% revenue growth. Its total commercial and consumer revenues respectively grew 11% and 18%.HP'S ENVY ALL-IN-ONE PC. IMAGE SOURCE: HP.That top line growth flies counter to the notion that PC sales could grind to a halt on longer upgrade cycles and the ubiquity of mobile devices. However, the unit's operating margin slipped 50 basis points annually to 3.8% during the quarter due to rising prices of components like memory chips, which caused the company's pre-tax earnings from continuing operations to dip nearly 1%.HP tried to offset higher component prices with slight price hikes and changes in its supply chain, but that cyclical pressure will likely persist for a few more quarters.How strong is HP's overall business?HP's PC business generated 65% of its revenues and 30% of its pre-tax earnings from continuing operations last quarter. The rest came from its printing business, which is posting positive top and bottom line growth on robust demand for consumer printers and printing supplies.HP is expanding that business by buying Samsung's printing unit, which will boost its market share in multifunction A3 printers, and expanding into new markets like mobile printers, industrial 3D printers, and next-gen metal 3D printers.Wall Street expects HP's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 4% and 10% this year. The company currently pays a forward dividend yield of 2.4%, which is supported by a low payout ratio of 36%, and the stock still looks surprisingly cheap at 13 times forward earnings -- even after rallying 60% over the past 12 months.The bottom lineHP is an easy stock to recommend for four reasons: it's outpacing the growth of the PC industry, it shrewdly dominates higher-growth PC markets while pivoting away from slower-growth ones like budget laptops, it pays a decent dividend, and the stock remains cheap in a frothy market. So if you're looking for stability, income, and value, HP might just be the right stock for you.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why HP Inc. Stock Climbed 42% in 2017,"Jan 8, 2018 at 7:25PM","What happenedShares of personal-computer and printer company HP (NYSE:HPQ) surged in 2017, climbing 41.6%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The stock's sharp rise was driven by accelerated growth as personal systems revenue growth hit double digits and printing revenue reversed from declines to growth.""Our results demonstrate that HP is strong and getting stronger,"" said HP CEO Dion Weisler in the company's fourth-quarter earnings release in November. Weisler is right. Not only is HP growing in both of its main segments -- personal systems and print -- but it's also seeing double-digit growth in all three of its geographic regions. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.So whatThe biggest highlight from the year was HP's revitalized print business. Consider the different trajectories of HP's printing revenue in its fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and its fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. In Q4 2017, printing revenue climbed 7% year over year. In Q4 2016, however, revenue in the segment was down 8% year over year. Efforts that helped revitalize its printing business include an automated printing supply ordering system, the diversification of its printing business into new products like its Sprocket mobile printer, and a bet on the A3 copier market with its acquisition of Samsung's printing business.Now whatHighlighting management's outlook for continued momentum, it recently raised its guidance for fiscal 2018 EPS. Management expects EPS between $1.70 and $1.80. This would mark a meaningful increase from full-year fiscal 2017 EPS of $1.48.In light of its strong revenue growth in fiscal 2017, management said its year-over-year comparisons will be ""much tougher"" in fiscal 2018, but management also said it's ""ready for it."" 10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Top Stocks That Aren't on Wall Street's Radar,"Jan 2, 2018 at 11:43AM","Wall Street analysts don't hold all the aces. Sometimes, the pros miss out on fantastic investment ideas. Getting in early on these under-followed story stocks can make you some serious money -- share prices often rise when analysts start their coverage, after all.We asked three Motley Fool investors for some high-powered stock tips with low analyst interest. Read on for a quick introduction to Kroger (NYSE:KR), Extreme Networks (NASDAQ:EXTR), and WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC). You'll like what you'll see in these near-forgotten classics.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.A discount for this leading grocery-store chainDemitri Kalogeropoulos (Kroger): It wasn't long ago that Kroger was one of Wall Street's favorite stocks. But the supermarket chain has underperformed the market over the last two years and completely missed 2017's rally.The main thing that changed was Kroger's sales-growth pace, which had been running at between 4% and 6% for most of 2014 and 2015. Since then, comparable-store sales dipped into negative territory and were stuck there as recently as early fiscal 2017.Yet Wall Street overreacted to this decline, in my view. After all, much of it had to do with the industrywide price deflation that impacted rivals, as well. Kroger's sales volumes kept up a steady growth pace, along with its market-share gains -- so the comps' dip was likely temporary.On the other hand, weakening industry dynamics forced the retailer to step away from its prior earnings growth target that promised investors profit gains of between 8% and 11%, plus a growing dividend. Instead, Kroger is likely to post lower earnings for fiscal 2017 as it invests in growth initiatives like lower prices, online ordering, and home delivery.The good news is that these moves have put comps on pace for their fourth-consecutive quarter of improvements, and that should give Kroger solid momentum as it aims to double its addressable market by expanding into the prepared-foods segment.150% gains amid deafening analyst silenceAnders Bylund (Extreme Networks): The enterprise-class networking world has gained a new giant, but analysts largely haven't noticed it yet. Through a series of smart acquisitions, old-school Ethernet-hardware specialist Extreme Networks has added modern technologies, like wireless mesh networks, fiber-optic transceivers, and virtual network-management tools in recent years.The new and improved Extreme Networks has earned industry plaudits including a coveted spot in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for wired and wireless network products. Armed with these selling points, a larger sales division is stealing enterprise contracts from HP Enterprise's (NYSE:HPE) Aruba Networks segment and from Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) -- the incumbent leaders in Extreme's chosen target market.Investors are already loving Extreme Networks' stronger market position, driving share prices 150% higher in 2017. Meanwhile, Cisco's stock gained a respectable 28% and HP Enterprise notched a much smaller 9% return.Yet, Wall Street has been slow to catch on. An army of 20 analyst firms have prepared earnings estimates for HP Enterprise's next quarterly report, and Cisco notched 26 earnings forecasts. In Extreme's corner of the Street, you could hear a pin drop as only five firms gathered to provide earnings estimates.Furthermore, the stock has room to run even higher in 2018. Extreme Networks' shares can be bought for just 11 times forward earnings today.You haven't missed the boat on Extreme Networks, and Wall Street is hardly even aware that there's a journey going on over here.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Boring Wall Street analysts to death with steady returnsTyler Crowe (WD-40 Company): With so many analysts filling the wings at brokerages and financial institutions, it's not that often that a company gets as little attention as WD-40. As it stands, only one analyst firm currently covers the stock and has earnings estimates. While there are likely a multitude of reasons this is the case, one significant factor is that the company's business is incredibly consistent and predictable.There's almost no scenario where you can call WD-40 a growth stock. Over the past 10 years, it has only produced total revenue growth of 20%. The enticing part for investors, though, is that those revenues come with high margins and high rates of free cash flow. For every dollar of revenue, WD-40 produces about $0.10 of free cash flow.Since the business doesn't require high levels of capital spending to maintain current operations or expand production -- WD-40 contracts out all manufacturing for its products to third-party suppliers -- it can return that cash to shareholders with a fast-growing dividend and share repurchases. As a result, that 20% increase in revenue has translated into a 100% increase in earnings per share and a 378% total return.WD-40's business may not get much love from Wall Street analysts, but any serious long-term investor has to be intrigued by a company that can continue to manufacture solid returns with such modest revenue growth. With shares trading at 31 times earnings, buying WD-40's stock perhaps isn't ideal today -- but it's certainly a company you should have on your radar.10 stocks we like better than KrogerWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks That Are Absurdly Cheap Right Now,"Jan 28, 2018 at 8:07AM","Stock prices are on a tear, making it more difficult to identify equities that still trade at a discount. However, as finding great deals on the stock market becomes more challenging, the rewards for doing so typically become greater as well.With the goal of turning readers on to underappreciated stocks that are trading at bargain prices, we asked three contributing investors to profile a company whose shares can be snatched up on the cheap. Here's why they identified HP (NYSE:HPQ), General Motors (NYSE:GM), and GameStop (NYSE:GME) as some of the most promising value plays on the market today.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.This ain't your daddy's HPLeo Sun (HP): HP, the biggest PC maker in the world, became a more streamlined company after it split with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise in 2015. The ""new"" HP now generates revenue from just two main businesses -- PCs and printers.PCs and printers sound like slow growth businesses, yet HP's PC and printer revenues respectively rose 13% and 7% annually last quarter. HP attributes its growth in PCs to better high-end laptop designs, new gaming PCs, more secure systems for enterprise customers, and its ongoing strength in the North American market.As for printers, higher sales of consumer units and supplies offset softer sales of commercial units. But HP is gradually evolving that business with its acquisition of Samsung's printing unit, the introduction of new 3D printers for industrial customers, and niche printing devices like mobile printers.HP's PC margins have been under pressure, because of cyclically high component prices, but those margins should improve over the next two years. Its printer margins have been improving and should expand even more after it integrates Samsung's business.Analysts expect HP's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 4% and 10% this year. It pays a forward dividend yield of 2.6%, and its low payout ratio of 36% gives it plenty of room for future increases. HP's stability makes it seem like an ideal investment for uncertain times, but it still trades at just 11 times next year's earnings -- making it an absurdly cheap stock in a frothy market.Growth hasn't disappeared yetDaniel Miller (General Motors): Investors have largely shied away from purchasing shares of General Motors while the U.S. new-vehicle market plateaus. And while a plateauing U.S. sales market will make growth more challenging, it doesn't make it impossible. Here are a couple of reasons why.First, while sales are indeed peaking, GM's focus on its Cadillac luxury brand will help improve margins. In fact, in 2017 Cadillac recorded its second highest sales mark in the brand's 115-year lifespan. Its sales jumped 15.5% compared with the prior year and notched 356,467 global deliveries. Cadillac's average transaction prices (ATPs) continue to climb and remain well above $54,000, and the brand owns the second highest ATPs among major luxury auto brands in the U.S. market.Another reason GM can drive its top and bottom line higher despite a slowing U.S. market is found overseas: China. GM and its joint ventures sold more than 4 million vehicles in China for the first time in 2017 -- a 4% increase from its previous record in 2016. China is also partly responsible for Cadillac's global surge, as the luxury brand's sales jumped 50.8% in 2017. GM added 18 new and refreshed models in China last year, and the fresher product mix should drive sales performances in the near term. GM also benefits from a surge in SUV popularity in China; GM's SUV sales surged 37% in China last year.Many investors are weary of investing in GM as its bread-and-butter U.S. market slows, but that doesn't mean GM's growth story is over just yet. GM also trades at an absurdly cheap forward price-to-earnings ratio of 7, according to Morningstar consensus estimates, and it offers a 3.5% dividend yield -- a very compelling option for value investors.An underestimated specialty retailerKeith Noonan (GameStop): If you would have told GameStop shareholders that its holiday sales report would arrive with news of an 11.8% year-over-year same-store-sales increase, a 38.3% increase for hardware sales, and a 7.3% jump in new software sales, the reaction from most would have been ecstatic. Even in the context of a 8.1% year-over-year sales decline for pre-owned software, that would have probably been enough good news to send the stock soaring -- were it delivered in isolation.Unfortunately, the company's holiday report also came with dismal results for its technology brands business, which mostly specializes in mobile hardware and service package sales. The segment's sales were down roughly 20% compared with the prior-year period, and GameStop's share price was once again sent tumbling. A change AT&T implemented to the compensation structure for selling wireless and DIRECTV service packages seems to have seriously dimmed the outlook for tech brands and overshadowed the noteworthy bright spots.Strong results for the company's video game retail unit over the holiday sales period suggest that its business may be more resilient than many are anticipating. The success of Nintendo's Switch console bodes well for GameStop over the next few years, because the system's limited storage space means it's poorly set up for digital downloads. New consoles from Sony and Microsoft are also probably due to be unveiled within the next couple of years and should provide additional positive catalysts for the company's core business. GameStop is also making some smart moves with its rewards programs, and its collectibles segment looks to provide a new source of sustainable, high-margin sales growth.The company's stock is priced at just 5.5 times this year's expected earnings and just a fifth of expected sales for the period. It's also sporting a whopping 8.7% dividend yield. With the company seemingly in good enough shape to maintain its payout, GameStop looks like a cheap play that could produce substantial returns for risk-tolerant investors.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Cisco Faces a Dangerous New Rival: AT&T,"Apr 3, 2018 at 11:45AM","Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), the largest manufacturer of network switches in the world, usually considers Huawei, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Arista Networks, and Juniper Networks to be its main competitors. Cisco controlled over half of the global ethernet switching market last year, according to IDC.However, a recent report from The Information indicates that AT&T (NYSE:T), one of Cisco's major customers, is developing its own network switches. That move would reduce AT&T's costs and give it more flexibility and customization options across its networks. But it also could hurt Cisco by shattering a main pillar of its business model.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Cisco shouldn't be surprisedOne of the greatest threats to Cisco's business is the rise of generic ""white-box"" routers and switches. These unbranded devices generally have less powerful hardware than Cisco's products, but the heavy lifting is accomplished via cloud-based software. This disruptive approach is known as software-defined networking (SDN).Cisco's core business relies on the notion that customers should buy all their networking hardware from a single vendor to ensure that everything runs smoothly. Cisco sells large quantities of routers and switches, which are often bundled with additional software to ""lock in"" these big customers. However, many companies now realize that white-box solutions usually work just as well as Cisco's hardware.Last April, AT&T tested a high-speed network entirely comprised of white-box hardware. The test also successfully sent data between white-box hardware from two different vendors running on two different types of chips -- which proved that it wasn't necessary for companies to buy all their networking solutions from a single vendor like Cisco. AT&T's white-box network ran on its own open-source network-management software, ECOMP. AT&T gave ECOMP to the Linux Foundation, which allows anyone -- including rival telcos -- to use or modify the software.That's why AT&T recently announced that it would deploy 60,000 white-box routers across its network, which would cut its costs and boost the capacity of its networks as it gears up for the 5G transition. Therefore, the revelation that AT&T is developing its own switches shouldn't surprise anyone -- least of all Cisco.How badly could this hurt Cisco?AT&T's white-box transition enabled it to reduce its spending on Cisco's networking solutions from $2 billion in 2013 to just $400 million in 2017. That figure could eventually fall to zero as AT&T rolls out its white-box routers and first-party switches.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The good news for Cisco is that $400 million accounted for less than 1% of its revenues last year, so a total loss of AT&T's business wouldn't disrupt its long-term growth. However, AT&T isn't the only major company using white-box hardware.Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) uses white-box hardware in its massive data centers and also has invented new switches that can replace Cisco's hardware. Like AT&T, Facebook is giving away its designs for free through its Open Compute Project.Other big service providers and enterprise customers likely will follow AT&T's and Facebook's lead in the near future. When they do, Cisco's routing and switching businesses -- which together generated 45% of its revenues last year -- could get crushed. Both businesses were already on shaky ground last year as switching revenues dropped 5% and routing revenues fell 4%.Cisco also is losing market share in both routers and switches to challengers like Huawei. Between 2016 and 2017, Cisco's share of the routing market fell from 42% to 36.7% as its share of the switching market fell from 57% to 54.9%, according to IDC.Should Cisco investors worry?AT&T's embrace of white-box routers and first-party switches is worrisome for Cisco. However, investors shouldn't overlook Cisco's strengths. The company is investing heavily in its higher-growth security and software collaboration businesses, which could offset the declining sales of its routers and switches.The company also is repatriating $67 billion in overseas cash -- and most of it is earmarked for buybacks, dividends, and domestic acquisitions. Those moves could attract value-seeking income investors and diversify Cisco's core business away from routers and switches.Analysts still expect Cisco's revenue and earnings to rise 2% and 8%, respectively, this year as it focuses more on the growth of its software businesses. The stock isn't expensive at 17 times forward earnings and it pays a solid forward dividend yield of 3%. Therefore, AT&T's move signals a disruptive shift in the industry, but investors shouldn't assume that Cisco isn't preparing for the future."
Best Selling PCs of 2017,"Jan 9, 2018 at 6:03PM","""When you're No. 4 or 5 in a market, when No. 1 sneezes, you get pneumonia. When you're No. 1, you control your destiny. The No. 4s keep merging; they have difficult times."" -- former GE head Jack WelchYou've got to hand it to Jack Welch -- the man knew how to turn a phrase. And this is why it's so important for investors in the personal computer industry to know which companies are winning (and which companies are losing) in the race to sell PCs to the masses. Wherever we may be in the computers cycle in any given year, and no matter how bad things get, you'll be better off investing in the No. 1 PC maker than in an also-ran.Fortunately, thanks to the tech wizards at Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), we now know which desktop computers (and with the click of a button, which laptop computers too) were the best selling PCs of 2017.HEWLETT-PACKARD'S HP 8300 ELITE SMALL FORM FACTOR DESKTOP COMPUTER BOASTS 500 GB OF STORAGE AND AN INTEGRATED INTEL HD GRAPHICS CHIP. IMAGE SOURCE: AMAZON.COM.Who won in desktopsAccording to Amazon's ""Best Sellers"" list, there was one clear winner in desktop PCs last year: HP, Inc. (NYSE:HPQ). The company still best known as ""Hewlett-Packard"" sold five of the top 10 best-selling desktop PC models in 2017, including the No. 1 HP 8300 Elite Small Form Factor desktop, the HP 22-b016 All-in-One desktop, and the HP Pavilion Power 580-023w Gaming Tower (ranked No. 1, 4, and 6, respectively, in Amazon's stats).Japan's Acer (a publicly traded company, but only in Japan) was close behind its rival. Two Acer Aspire desktops, one featuring the Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) i3 processor and one with an i5, took the No. 2 and No. 3 slots. Privately held MINIX, Cyberpower, and Dell all tied for third place, with one high-selling desktop PC apiece. (In Dell's case, this was the Dell OptiPlex, Intel Core 2 Duo).All 10 of these 10 best-selling PCs were Windows machines. Among desktops, at least, Apple computers remain a niche product.Who won in laptopsAnd what were laptop shoppers buying in 2017? Here the news is not as good for HP. The company's top-selling laptop -- an HP 14 Inch ""Stream"" with a Celeron processor and Windows 10 operating system -- ranked only No. 2 on Amazon's top 10 list. And only three of those top 10 notebooks were HP products.Instead, Acer took top honors, winning four of the top 10 slots and also the No. 1 position. Acer's Aspire E 15-inch notebook was the top-selling laptop PC of 2017.Samsung came in at No. 3 with a Chromebook running Google's operating system. And ASUS (again, publicly traded in Japan) rounded out the list with two top-10 sellers in the laptop PC category.Interestingly, out of all these top 20 desktops and laptops combined, only one machine -- Acer's Predator Helios -- featured the powerful Intel i7 processor. Most of the other units maxed out at an i5, which suggests that shoppers were price conscious last year, and happy to settle for a less powerful chip in exchange for getting a more attractive price.What it means to investorsWhat conclusions can investors draw from the above? With seven of the top 20 best selling PCs of 2017, drawn from both the desktop and laptop categories, HP remains a force to contend with. On Amazon at least, HP appears to be the clear winner and the No. 1 seller of PCs overall for 2017. This success is reflected in the company's financial statements, with data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showing that HP enjoyed 11% year over year sales gains from its ""Personal Systems"" (which includes PC sales) division through October. In contrast, Acer's sales were up only 2% through October, and ASUSTeK's PC sales (and profits) were down.That said, Acer didn't fall that far behind HP in 2017, scoring six top sellers across the desktop and laptop lines. What's more, as the world moves inexorably toward laptops and away from desktops, Acer's leading position in laptop sales is something HP should worry about."
Where Will AMD Be in 5 Years?,"Jan 26, 2018 at 7:11PM","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) shot into the limelight a couple of years ago when it announced that it would be targeting the high-end computing market with its Ryzen CPUs and Vega GPUs. In fact, 2016 was one of AMD's best years on the stock market after three years of underperformance, as investors thought that it would take the game to the likes of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which dominate this space.AMD DATA BY YCHARTS.But reality struck hard in 2017 after the initial hype around its new products died down. AMD conceded market share to NVIDIA after the launch of its new graphics cards, as they turned out to be a year behind NVIDIA's offerings. Meanwhile, AMD was locked in an intense battle with Intel in the desktop CPU and server processor markets, succeeding over there to some extent.AMD's mixed 2017 dented investor confidence, and the stock has underperformed the market by a wide margin over the past year. Is this the beginning of yet another streak of underperformance for AMD, or should investors remain patient in the hope that it will beat the market over the next five years? Let's find out.IMAGE SOURCE: AMD. A look at GPU prospectsNVIDIA is completely dominant in GPUs right now with a market share of almost 73%, according to the latest data from Jon Peddie Research. This is a great position to be in as Allied Market Research expects global GPU sales to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35.6% over the next five years thanks to their applications in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI), and increasingly complex computer games.NVIDIA has deeply embedded itself across all segments of the GPU market, be it games, AI, or AR and VR. More important, it has established a technology lead over AMD. For instance, AMD's Vega GPUs, launched in 2017, barely match NVIDIA's two-year-old offerings in terms of pricing, performance, and power efficiency.NVIDIA has established itself as the go-to provider in the data center space, where GPU demand is rapidly increasing to power AI applications. It had scored wins at all the top data center providers and cloud service providers before AMD's Vega consumer cards came to the market.AMD was late to the game, as its cloud-centric Radeon Instinct GPUs went on sale only in the second quarter of 2017. But NVIDIA had swept this market for itself by then as its Titan X GPU was available for training deep-learning applications on the cloud back in 2016. So it is not surprising to see why NVIDIA's GPUs are available across all the top cloud service providers.More important, NVIDIA customers like Amazon Web Services are already upgrading to new GPUs based on the Volta architecture, making it difficult for AMD to make inroads there.In fact, NVIDIA's absolute domination in the GPU space has forced rivals AMD and Intel to form an alliance. Intel recently announced Core i5 and Core i7 chips with integrated AMD Radeon RX Vega GPUs targeted at the notebook market. Intel and AMD believe that they can help laptop original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) save space on their notebooks with an integrated chip platform.This will allow OEMs to increase battery life by packing a bigger battery pack or bump up performance by integrating a bigger memory. But the success of this partnership isn't guaranteed as NVIDIA's Max-Q design already allows laptop makers to offer thin form factors without compromising on performance.And NVIDIA is reportedly going to counter the Intel-AMD combine with a budget Max-Q chip based on the older GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti GPUs. So AMD's prospects in the GPU space appear to be on thin ice.What about the CPU market?AMD has made good progress in CPUs, taking market share from Intel thanks to its Ryzen chips. The company is now aggressively going after Intel in this space, recently claiming that its processors can match Intel's offerings at way lower price points.At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas earlier this month, AMD pointed out that one of its integrated CPU-GPU chips based on the Ryzen platform can match the performance of Intel's Core i5-8400 chip with an NVIDIA GT 1030 graphics card -- and at a price point that's $120 lower.This is AMD's go-to-market strategy: cutting-edge performance on a budget. CEO Lisa Su made this very clear at CES 2018 when she said that ""at every price point, we offer more threads, more multi-threaded performance.""AMD isn't done attacking Intel's position in the CPU space just yet as it will soon come out with a new slate of products. The company indicates that Ryzen CPUs based on Zen 2 and Zen 3 architectures that will be released in 2019 and 2020, respectively, will deliver better performance gains when compared to the 7% to 8% jump usually seen in Intel's recent generational changes.AMD is also giving Intel sleepless nights in the server processor market. Last year's launch of the EPYC server processor has improved AMD's standing in this market, where Intel currently has a monopoly like position. For instance, the likes of Microsoft, Baidu, and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise have already deployed or are in the process of deploying EPYC-based server systems or cloud computing services.So AMD can claw back market share from Intel in server processors and CPUs because of its aggressive product development and rapidly growing partnerships. But it remains to be seen if it can gain enough traction in the CPU market to overcome the challenge posed by NVIDIA in GPUs. Investors need to be cautious when investing in AMD, as it could witness a period of volatility over the next five years because of its fight against bigger players like Intel and NVIDIA."
3 Reasons Intel Should Buy Qualcomm Inc.,"Mar 20, 2018 at 9:15AM","Broadcom(NASDAQ:AVGO) recently abandoned its hostile bid for Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) after President Trump blocked the deal on security concerns. On its own, Qualcomm faces tough headwinds -- regulators and OEMs are attacking its licensing business, and the approval of its planned buyout of NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI) remains stuck in regulatory limbo in China.However, Qualcomm also remains a lucrative buyout target in its weakened state. It's lost a quarter of its market value since it hit a multi-year high in mid-2014, and the majority of its shareholders were ready to approve Broadcom's six board nominees before the deal was blocked.IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL.Therefore, any tech company which was eyeing Qualcomm before should strike soon. I personally believe the most logical suitor is Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), for three simple reasons.1. Reclaiming the mobile marketOne of Intel's biggest mistakes over the past decade was losing the mobile SoC (system on chip) market to Qualcomm in three steps. First, it refused to produce SoCs for the iPhone, believing that Apple would never sell the device in large enough quantities.IMAGE SOURCE: APPLE.Second, it underestimated the appeal of low-powered ARM chips over x86 ones, and sold its ARM chip producer, XScale, to Marvell in 2006.Lastly, Intel's own Atom x86 chips, which were aimed at mobile devices, failed to match most ARM chips in terms of power efficiency. Meanwhile, Qualcomm wiped out the competition and emerged as the market leader in ARM SoCs -- making it the largest mobile chipmaker in the world.Intel attempted to reenter the mobile market by paying OEMs billions of dollars in subsidies, but it ended up with less than 1% of the market. Intel eventually regained a foothold with its baseband modems, which Apple started using in its iPhones alongside Qualcomm's modems in 2016. Intel and Qualcomm are both investing heavily in 5G technologies, so pooling the two company's resources would be a smart long-term move.If Intel buys Qualcomm, it would instantly control 42% of the smartphone application processor market, according to Counterpoint's third quarter numbers. That would make Intel the top maker of chips for PCs, data centers, and mobile devices in the world.2. Widening its moat in PCs and data centersSpeaking of PCs and data centers, Qualcomm is emerging as a threat to Intel in both markets. Last year, Qualcomm partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to launch ARM-powered Windows 10 laptops, and ported Windows Server for ARM chips.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The two companies then showcased a Windows Server running on Qualcomm's Centriq 2400-series data center chip -- which targets Intel's flagship Xeon chips. Qualcomm claims that its 48-core Centriq 2460 offers a four-fold improvement in performance per dollars against Intel's Xeon Platinum 8180.Qualcomm clearly wants to expand into Intel's backyard, and a lot of tech giants -- including Alibaba, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, and Samsung -- are already testing out its data center chips.If Intel buys Qualcomm, it can offer both x86 and ARM CPUs for PCs and data centers -- which would give it a lot of flexibility against its smaller rival AMD.3. Autos and adjacent marketsIntel and Qualcomm are both expanding into the automotive, computer vision, and Internet of Things (IoT) markets to diversify away from their core businesses. Intel previously acquired computer vision start-ups Movidius and Itseez, along with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) maker Mobileye, to bolster these next-gen efforts.Qualcomm previously bought CSR, a maker of IoT and automotive chips, and is currently trying to close its purchase of NXP, the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world. It sells custom Snapdragon chips for cars, drones, wearables, and other devices, and it's partnered with Himax in the development of depth-sensing camera systems.Buying Qualcomm would eliminate a key rival in these markets, reduce costs, and give Intel big bundling opportunities across multiple markets.But can Intel pull off such a huge deal?Intel is still integrating its previous acquisitions of Movidius and Mobileye, so it's unclear if the chipmaker is ready to move in on Qualcomm. Matching Broadcom's final offer of $117 billion for Qualcomm would be a monumental task, even for one of the world's biggest chipmakers.Intel finished last year with $14 billion in cash and equivalents in the US. It holds an estimated $27 billion overseas, which it will likely repatriate due to tax law changes. It's also shouldering $25 billion in long-term debt.This means that Intel would need to spend all of its cash, take on more debt, and make up the difference with stock to come close to $117 billion. The deal would also be scrutinized by antitrust regulators, who probably don't want a single chipmaker to dominate the PC, data center, and mobile markets. Nonetheless, it's an enticing opportunity, and I wouldn't be surprised if Intel is mulling a takeover right now. "
Meg Whitman and Jeff Katzenberg Team Up on This Media Start-Up,"Feb 2, 2018 at 8:34PM","In November, Meg Whitman announced she would be stepping down as CEO of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE). Upon the announcement, Whitman said she might consider another CEO job, but that, ""it would have to be the right role. ... I've been working nonstop for 35 years, so I'll definitely take some downtime to recharge."" So it may be surprising that just two months later, Whitman has already signed on for her next gig -- and the differences between her new job and her recent position at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) couldn't be more stark.MEG WHITMAN IS TAKING THE HELM OF A MOBILE VIDEO START-UP. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.What is NewTV?Whitman signed on to be CEO of media start-up NewTV, a venture company underneath WndrCo LLC, which is a holding company formed by ex-DreamWorks Animation CEO and former Disney (NYSE:DIS) executive Jeffrey Katzenberg. Katzenberg raised $600 million for WndrCo LLC from investors last year and aims to make a step-change in mobile content production with the new company.The goal of NewTV is to create high-quality, short-form content for mobile devices. The content will consist of complete stories, as well as serialized shows broken up into short episodes. The aim of the company is to bring a higher level of production quality to short-form mobile content, which has traditionally been done on small, shoestring budgets with unknown actors.Where Whitman fits inHeading up a media company aimed at 18-to-34-year-olds may seem like a strange choice for Whitman. After all, she spent the last six years at HPE, a declining enterprise business adapting to the changes of cloud computing and commoditized hardware. Whitman spent much of her time there financial engineering, including significant cost-cutting, and splitting HPE's printing and enterprise computing businesses into two separate entities. Managing a mature business-to-business company seems like the polar opposite of operating a business-to-consumer start-up.Of course, before HPE, Whitman was CEO of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) from 1998 to 2008, where she grew the start-up from 30 employees and $4 million in revenue to 15,000 employees and $8 billion in revenue by the time she left. So perhaps Whitman was hankering to return to a small company where she can make a similar difference. ""It's a return to my start-up roots,"" Whitman said of the job at NewTV. In addition, before these high-profile CEO positions, Whitman had worked at Disney in the 1980s, as vice president of strategic planning, and she became close to Katzenberg, who was the creative force behind Disney's 1990s resurgence. In addition, Whitman served on the board of DreamWorks, which Katzenberg founded after his time at Disney. DreamWorks was sold to Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) in 2016.So, while NewTV is much different than Whitman's most recent gig, her closeness with Katzenberg, her background in media, and the chance to once again run a start-up likely attracted her to the NewTV job.Can NewTV work?At first glance, NewTV may seem like an odd idea for a start-up, given the current saturated media environment. All across the industry, traditional media companies are scrambling to deal with the rise of both cord-cutting and the entry of huge tech companies into the media space. In an already crowded environment when most media companies are looking to either buy other companies or get bought out themselves, why would someone want to build yet another independent media company from scratch?Obviously, Katzenberg's heft in the industry and ability to create content is one differentiating factor, as is the concept of putting large budgets behind short-form content. While the idea may be unique, the content will, of course, have to generate enough revenue to justify higher production budgets, either through advertising or subscriptions, and that model is unproven. On the other hand, given the amount of time we're all spending on our smartphones, NewTV could potentially mark a new chapter in the history of media, so stay tuned.10 stocks we like better than Hewlett Packard EnterpriseWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What Happened in the Stock Market Today,"Feb 23, 2018 at 5:06PM","Stocks ended the week with broad-based gains on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) both rose by well over 1%, surging in the last hour.Today's stock marketIndex Percentage Change Point ChangeDow 1.39% 347.51S&P 500 1.60% 43.34DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE.Long-term interest rates fell, and rate-sensitive utility stocks led the market; the Utilities Select SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLU) rose 2.6%. As for individual stocks, General Mills (NYSE:GIS) announced its first move into pet food by acquiring Blue Buffalo Pet Products (NASDAQ:BUFF), and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) reported strong quarterly results.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.General Mills jumps into the pet food categoryGeneral Mills announced it will be acquiring Blue Buffalo Pet Products in an $8 billion cash deal, causing Blue Buffalo shares to surge 17.2% and General Mills stock to slump 3.6%. Blue Buffalo also announced fourth-quarter sales were up 14.2% and adjusted earnings per share increased 51.4%, with both figures coming in above analysts' expectations. General Mills is paying $40 per share for the leader in the ""wholesome natural"" pet food category, a 23% premium to Blue Buffalo's 60-day volume weighted average price. The purchase will be financed by a combination of debt, cash on hand, and approximately $1 billion in equity. The deal has been approved by both boards.Blue Buffalo had $1.275 billion in sales in 2017, representing year-over-year growth of 10.9%. According to today's presentation, sales have had compounded annual growth of 12% in the last three years and adjusted EBITDA has grown 18%. General Mills expects to cut $50 million in annual expenses, and thinks the deal will be neutral to cash EPS in fiscal 2019 and accretive in fiscal 2020.That price tag of 6.3 times sales certainly raised eyebrows and was probably the reason why General Mills shares slipped on the news. But the maker of Cheerios and Haagen-Dazs has been struggling with growth, along with much of the packaged food industry. The pet food industry is growing 3% to 4% annually, and Blue Buffalo is well-positioned in the fastest-growing and highest-margin segment, so this may turn out to be a very positive step in reshaping of the company's portfolio.Hewlett Packard Enterprise reports big profit gain and huge dividend boostThe new CEO for Hewlett Packard Enterprise got off on the right foot with investors today, announcing expectation-beating fiscal Q1 results and a 50% hike in the dividend, sending shares soaring 10.5%. Antonio Neri, who replaced Meg Whitman at the beginning of this month, reported revenue increased 11.2% to $7.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 21.4% to $0.34. Analysts were expecting EPS of $0.22 on revenue of $7.1 billion. The company's growth was broad-based. HPE's largest segment, hybrid IT, grew revenue 10%. Within that division, compute increased 11%, storage surged 24%, and data center networking jumped 27%. Pointnext, the services and consulting arm, grew 2%. As for HPE's other two segments, Intelligent Edge, HPE's Aruba networking unit, grew 9%, and financial services revenue increased 8%.Neri announced that as a result of tax reform, HPE will return $7 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2019 in the form of share buybacks and a 50% increase in the dividend, starting in the third quarter of this year. It will also increase its matching contribution for employee retirement plans.Looking forward, HPE raised its guidance for 2018 EPS to a range of $1.35 to $1.45, well above Wall Street expectations of $1.18 per share.Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock languished for most of last year as the company trimmed down to reinvigorate growth. But the shares have picked up since the company's last quarterly report and big dividend raise.

"Is Cisco Systems, Inc. a Buy in 2018?","Jan 20, 2018 at 11:05AM","Unlike some of its counterparts, including beleaguered cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and software provider HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) ended 2017 on a high note. Cisco not only reported a strong fiscal 2018 first quarter; expectations are even higher in the current period.Though its recent quarter and guidance gave Cisco stock a lift, a closer look reveals there were plenty of other results that bode well for 2018. That said, Cisco's transition away from legacy networking switches and routers is far from over. The question of whether Cisco is a buy in 2018 depends on whether it continues making progress where it counts.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Laying the foundationIt will be three years in May since Chuck Robbins took over as Cisco CEO. Robbins wasted no time letting shareholders know what his plans were. Cisco's transitioning into new markets, becoming more efficient, and building a sustainable foundation of revenue were all at the top of Robbins' priority list.Cisco no longer reports individual product sales each quarter. But prior to the reporting change, routers and switches were sinking every quarter, with strength in IaaS, the Internet of Things (IoT), and software all growing. Presumably, Cisco's IaaS platform unit's 4% drop in revenue to $6.97 billion last quarter includes its legacy products.It's no easy feat successfully completing a transformation as comprehensive as Cisco's: Just ask HP Enterprise. It's been over two years since the split with HP, and HP Enterprise still hasn't found its footing. The CEO swap on Feb. 1 to Antonio Neri demonstrates how tough change can be. Yet, Cisco is already rounding the corner while competitors like HP Enterprise continue to struggle.Though IaaS sales declined 4%, Cisco's $12.14 billion in total revenue was a mere 2% decline compared to a year ago. Most of the IaaS shortcoming was made up by a 6% rise in application revenue to $1.2 billion, much of which was packaged with Cisco's IaaS platform sales.Security sales climbed 8% to $585 million and are slowly becoming a larger piece of Cisco's total revenue each quarter. Cisco's cloud software offerings will expand further following the $1.9 billion acquisition of BroadSoft (NASDAQ:BSFT). The strength of Cisco's ""new"" units is largely responsible for its guidance of a return to revenue growth this quarter (fiscal second quarter of 2018) of 1% to 3%.When less is moreIn keeping with its new business focus, Cisco has implemented a series of layoffs, including its latest of 310 workers from its San Jose, California headquarters in October. Cutting jobs is never fun, but in Cisco's case its transition resulted in redundancies. The upside is that Cisco expects a return to top-line growth and its earnings per share (EPS) are improving.Despite the slight drop in total revenue, thanks to shaving 7% off its operating expenses to $4.7 billion, Cisco's EPS rose 4% over last year to $0.48 a share in the first quarter. The EPS growth was in conjunction with Cisco raising its per-share dividend payout 13% year over year to $0.29. Cisco's 2.8% dividend yield is one of the best of its peer group.Save the best for lastThe added benefit of Cisco's software and cloud IaaS sales is those sales building a foundation of recurring revenue. In 2018's fiscal first quarter, 32% of Cisco's total revenue was recurring, up three percentage points over last year. That means that $3.87 billion of Cisco's sales were generated by sources shareholders can rely on in the months and years ahead.Investors can expect Cisco's recurring revenue to continue climbing, too. Cisco ended its first quarter with $18.57 billion in deferred sales, a 10% improvement compared to a year ago, and that wasn't the best news. Of its total deferred revenue, $5.2 billion was recurring, a whopping 37% jump.As you may have guessed, the answer to the question, ""Is Cisco a buy in 2018?"" is a resounding ""yes.""

Why AMD Is Ripe for a Turnaround in 2018,"Jan 4, 2018 at 10:06PM","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) had entered 2017 with terrific momentum thanks to its market share gains against rival NVIDIA, but this has fizzled out as the hype around its Vega graphics cards didn't translate into results. Investors were disappointed as these Vega graphics cards were supposed to help AMD make inroads into the premium desktop market where NVIDIA holds sway.But when it came to light that AMD's latest GPUs (graphics processing units) are unable to match NVIDIA in terms of performance or value, AMD bulls started feeling uneasy. The unease turned into panic when AMD guided for a 15% sequential drop in fourth-quarter revenue despite news of potential market share gains against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the server chip space.The negative sentiment has weighed heavily on AMD shares in recent months, but investors shouldn't lose hope just yet as it could make a big comeback in 2018. Here's why.IMAGE SOURCE: AMD Notebooks could give AMD a shot in the armA number of OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) have either committed to or have started launching AMD-powered notebooks of late. At the end of October, AMD announced that it will be combining its Ryzen CPUs (central processing units) with the Vega GPU cores in a single platform in a bid to enhance performance while keeping power consumption low.According to AMD, the combined architecture (known as an APU in AMD speak) could boost the performance of the GPU and the CPU by 128% and 200%, respectively, as compared to the previous generation. What's more, AMD claims that the performance boost has been achieved along with a 58% drop in power consumption.They can be used to power ultra-thin notebooks where performance needs to be condensed in a compact size without compromising on the battery life. Now, AMD believes that these new APUs can reduce the size of an ultra-thin notebook by as much as 24% despite the bump in performance and lower power consumption.Not surprisingly, the GPU specialist has already received commitments from the likes of Acer, HP, and, Lenovo, who are expected to launch AMD-powered devices from the first quarter of 2018. Additionally, AMD recently struck a partnership with Intel to manufacture a high-end notebook chip.AMD will be making a custom GPU chip for Intel, which Chipzilla will combine with its laptop-gaming focused CPU to create an integrated package that can help laptop OEMs save space and accelerate performance. This could allow laptop makers to include a bigger battery, more memory, or reduce the notebook size.In all, AMD believes that its notebook chips could increase its addressable market by $10 billion. This isn't surprising as there are currently 450 million laptops on the market with an age of more than five years. So, AMD could win big from the upgrade cycle once its laptop OEM partners start launching new devices from 2018.The server business could hit critical massAMD has been taking market share away from Intel in the server chip space and Intel seems to be admitting that it could lose more ground in the server chip market where it holds a market share in excess of 90%.This doesn't seem very surprising as Intel has been under a lot of pressure in this segment ever since AMD launched its EPYC server chips in mid-2017, promising a strong performance on a budget.AMD's server chip has gained a lot of traction, with Chinese cloud companies such as Baidu, JD.com, and Alibaba already using the EPYC platform in their datacenters.For instance, AMD recently announced that Baidu is using the EPYC server processor to provide artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled services to its customers. AMD also mentioned that Baidu is going to expand the deployment of the EPYC processors across its datacenters from the first quarter of the new calendar year.Additionally, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise recently became the first major server OEM to launch an EPYC-based two-socket server, while Dell also seems to be in the running to deploy its own server based on AMD's platform. Looking ahead, it is likely that more server manufacturers will adopt the EPYC chip given its potential to reduce server operational costs by as much as 50%, as found out by HPE when it deployed the same in its recently launched data center server.This points toward a substantial long-term growth opportunity for AMD as the global data center server market will be worth $56 billion in 2021, according to TechNavio. AMD doesn't have a significant presence in this market yet. So continued market share gains against Intel will put this business in a higher gear as more data center customers start using the EPYC platform from 2018.This is why AMD investors shouldn't lose hope after a disappointing end to 2017 as the company is riding on strong catalysts to boost its growth in the New Year.10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro DevicesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
