"Dude, You're Not Getting DELL...Or AUTO",Mar.18.13,"(At Least Not At These Prices)Despite differences in scale and profile, two recently announced deals, Dell Inc. (NASDAQ:DELL) and AutoInfo, Inc. (OTC:AUTO), have something in common; they are both bold attempts to transfer value from current shareholders to management-led buyout groups. These are not takeunders in the traditional sense, in that they are not priced at a discount to the market price; however, they are priced well below the target's standalone intrinsic value. Both offers require significant bumps in price in order to avoid massive, voluntary wealth transfers away from current shareholders.The leveraged buyout of DELL was priced at $13.65, which is substantially less than what DELL is worth. Potential bidders such as Blackstone Group LP (NYSE:BX), Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE:HPQ) and Lenovo Group Ltd. were not given an opportunity to bid on DELL at the same time as the buyout group. Concerns of shareholders such as Southeastern Asset Management Inc., T. Rowe Price Group Inc., and Carl Icahn were ignored. The buyout group believes that they can make a multiple of their money by simply leveraging up DELL's balance sheet. But of course DELL could do that on behalf of their own shareholders. They do not need to transfer the equity in order to enrich the equity holders."
Critical Analysis Of Dell Buyout Plan Shows High-Yield Opportunity In Bonds,Mar.14.13,"The media is currently focused on the saga of Michael Dell's battle with existing shareholders to take ""his"" company private. Many investors that have owned Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) over the past five years have been disappointed in stock performance. Likewise, with the current news stories, many investors are probably glad they did not ""buy a Dell"" share in the past five years.But the past is not always correlated with the future. The question is whether there is an investment opportunity in Dell today. Obviously it is not in the equity because assuming the deal is closed, it will be taken private. But there are more than just equities in the investment universe. A thorough credit review of Dell produces a unique high yield investment opportunity, assuming the LBO is not completely derailed by activist shareholders such as Carl Icahn.The analysis in this article shows that the worst case scenario for Dell shareholders now is that the deal falls apart because activist shareholders come in, block the private equity transaction and then lever up to pay themselves a big dividend. That would put the shareholders in valuation purgatory where the ability to unlock value from the existing assets is left in limbo - and in a technology driven company this is the ""kiss of death.""Assuming the Dell merger deal is closed, a quasi-equity credit opportunity in the long-term Dell bonds is available with a high coupon, moderately aggressive cash flow coverage (contrary to fears in the market presently) and most of all, long duration equity partners that align with Michael Dell's vision for the company, and with deep enough pockets to mitigate downside risk of long-term creditors.Entering this type of investment position with any confidence requires critical analysis of Dell from a credit perspective, including:Bond Pricing - what is the risk reward pricing of Dell bonds today?Credit Analysis - what condition will Dell be in post LBO?Down-side Risk analysis - what happens in the worst case?Icahn Factor - what happens if the leveraged buy-out deal blows up?"
The Value Of Dell Using The EBIT Multiple Valuation Method,Mar.14.13,"Let me go through a EBIT multiple valuation method using Dell (NASDAQ:DELL). The free online calculator can be found here.P/E multiples are thrown around a lot when talking about stocks, but there is a much better way to value stocks using multiples -- EBIT multiples. Don't be shocked. Just because I'm a value investor doesn't mean I do not look at multiples. I like to concentrate on value-based metrics such as P/FCF, which is a variation of P/E, and even EV/EBITDA, but the more tools I have and understand how and when to use them only helps me as an investor.Given that most people use multiple valuation methods incorrectly, I will show you how to do it the proper way.How People Perform Multiples ValuationThe All Too Common WayYou may have heard this sort of analysis before:""DELL is trading at a P/E of 10.6x with a forward P/E of 8.7x. Its competitors are trading between 9x and 14x. If DELL corrects its problems, it should trade at similar multiples to its competitors. Therefore, DELL is worth $18.""Problems Doing It This WayRight away, there are some fundamental flaws. I understand the importance of keeping things simple, but not so simple that it affects the whole underlying principle.P/E is a broad metric that can vary greatly depending on adjustments to the income statement, such as:A goodwill charge can reduce earnings drastically, although it doesn't affect the business operationIncome from discontinued operations can inflate P/EEBIT Multiple Valuation Is The Better WayYou start with a normalized revenue estimate, enter a conservative, normal and aggressive operating margin to get the EBIT. Then decide what multiplier you want against EBIT, add cash and subtract debt to get a total equity value.It's simple and doesn't remove everything just for the sake of keeping it simple. What's more, if you are looking at a company with several subsidiaries or operating segments that do vastly different things, you can apply the EBIT method for each segment and then add it up to get a sum-of-parts valuation."
Dell LBO Deal Structure - Like Buying A Rental House With Cashback And No Money Down,Feb. 7.13,"Henry Blodget is pulling on exactly the right thread with respect to why the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) leveraged buyout deal is so amazing for Michael Dell and his private equity partners and why it's not so great for existing shareholders.No matter what you think of Dell's products, growth trend, competitive landscape, etc. - this company prints a LOT of cash. So much cash that it's made over $8 billion in acquisitions AND over $3 billion in repurchases and dividends over the last three years, while maintaining a large $5 billion net cash position (as of the 11/2/2012 10-Q).Why aren't more people actually talking about the deal structure here and what it means for how much actual ""at risk equity"" both MSD and SLP are needing to put up to take the whole company private?Sources and Uses:Uses: It's a $25 billion deal, give or take, after including fees. Let's estimate the company has $3.5 billion of onshore cash and LT investments available to use in the transaction, which counts as a negative use of cash because it can be used to buy shares at the LBO price. That figure is approximated by the company's own recent statements that 25% of its cash flow is generated in the U.S. That leaves $21 billion, give or take.Sources:Let's just take the low end of the $13B-15B reported bank financing, to be conservative ($13B). Then let's add the $2B borrowed from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the form of some kind of note. Ok, that's $15B of total sources before you get to the new/rollover equity required to fund the deal. So the new/rollover equity required is then $6B ($21B minus $15B), of which $3.3B or so is simply a tax-free rollover of Dell's existing shares. That leaves a $2.7B equity ""hole"" to plug from a combination of MSD Capital and SLP (and whatever other co-investors they manage to corral into the deal). It has been reported that SLP will need to kick in anywhere between $1-1.5B for its equity portion of the deal. That looks like a lot of equity to commit, even for a big fund like SLP."
Billionaire Carl Icahn Moving Into Multilevel-Marketing And PCs...After Blockbuster,"Mar. 12, 2013 8:55 AM ET","In the view of many investors, billionaire Carl Icahn has been making some unique and potentially risky moves as of late. From his bold entry into Herbalife (NYSE:HLF), which brought noted investor Bill Ackman's short position to a grinding halt, to his recent interest in the struggling PC business (NASDAQ:DELL), Mr. Icahn has been capturing the spotlight.With an estimated net worth of $14 billion, Icahn is a force to be reckoned with on the street. He earned the reputation of a ""corporate raider"" after his hostile takeover of TWA in 1985.In 2005, Icahn won a proxy fight to add himself and two other members to the board of Blockbuster. Icahn fought CEO Jeff Antioco over ways to return the company to profits. Icahn wanted a reduction in pay for Antioco and also wanted to reinstate late fees on rentals. Antioco wanted to keep Blockbuster independent but Icahn pushed to have it buy out Hollywood Video and then sell the package (Blockbuster and its acquisitions) to a private equity firm. Antioco backed out of the deal to buy Hollywood Video because he was concerned that the package could be viewed as a monopoly by authorities.By 2011, Carl Icahn referring to the Blockbuster deal, said:Blockbuster turned out to be the worst investment I ever made. It failed because of too much debt and changes in the industry.In the past couple of months Icahn has stepped boldly into Herbalife, a multi-level-marketing company that deals in nutritional products, taking a 15% stake in the company's stock. This comes after activist investor Bill Ackman publicly announced a huge short position in the company and called it a pyramid scheme. Ackman added that he expected Herbalife stock to go to zero.Ackman and Icahn went toe to toe on live TV in a name calling session over their respective Herbalife positions."
Seagate Technology: This Buyout Bust Still Made Investors Rich,Jan.25.13,"With the buyout talks of Dell heating up and the rekindling of a potential buyout of Best Buy back on the table, we decided to find out what one of billionaire David Einhorn and Greenlight Capital's top picks has been up since its run in with the LBO markets in 2010. Seagate Technology (STX) rejected a potential buyout in 2010 by private equity firms, claiming that the price was too low. Since the tech company rejected the buyout bid in 2010, the stock has surged 145%, compared to the NASDAQ Index's 25%. Many hedge funds, along with Einhron, have been buying up shares of Seagate, including Jim Simons and Ken Griffin (check out all the hedge funds in love with Seagate).Billionaire David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital jumped into Seagate during the first quarter of 2011 by buying up 3.2 million shares. At the time he joined fellow billionaire Eddie Lampert of ESL Investments who owned 7.9 million shares. Since then ESL has dumped almost all of its shares, but Einhorn has managed to up his ownership to 16.5 million shares -- almost 5% of Seagate's outstanding shares (check out Lampert's newest picks).Buyout rejection. Seagate ended the latest buyout talks in 2010, which would have been its second takeover in the last decade. While some analysts thought that the termination of a buyout was no surprise, citing the fact that the industry was in decline and fundamentals would remain weak for the foreseeable future. This has not been the case. After the buyout of Seagate was abandoned, some analysts noted that the future free cash flow for the hard disk drive makers was highly uncertain, where one ThinkEquity analyst estimated the numbers to be $1.2 million annually, an underestimate to say the least.Lots of cash. In early 2012, Seagate upped its stock buyback plan to an authorized $3.5 billion in an effort to return cash to shareholders. Returning cash to shareholders should continue to be the norm, where the company has already amassed $2.4 billion.The free cash flow generation by Seagate has been very impressive over the past few years:"
5 Thoughts On The Berkshire/3G - Heinz Deal,Feb.16.13,"When you combine the most oft discussed investor in the world with the largest takeover of a packaged food company in history, you get a market event ripe for analysis. Below are five of my thoughts on the transaction and potential implications on your portfolio.Leveraging Low VolatilityIn a January 2013 article, Making Buffett's Alpha Your Own, I showed that investors could have replicated the returns of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) over the last twenty years by buying low volatility stocks, as proxied by the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index (NYSEARCA:SPLV), and levering them up consistent with the leverage employed by Berkshire Hathaway. An equity stake in Heinz (HNZ) is consistent with this strategy. In fact, Heinz was the fifteenth largest holding in this index given its low trailing volatility, putting the company in the 97th percentile of the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) based on low volatility. If understanding the Low Volatility Anomaly and use of leverage is the overarching key to Buffett's long-run success, then Seeking Alpha readers can replicate this strategy without having to pay twenty percent takeover premiums like in the Heinz deal.Leveraging Transactions Focus on OperatorsPast episodes of leveraged corporate acquisitions prominently featured financial buyers. I have been long of the opinion that levering up a company with stable cash flows is a homogeneous skill that was not unique to wunderkinds at top private equity firms. After the LBO boom of 2006-2007 fizzled into a host of overlevered and underperforming companies and a scarred financial system, companies do not appear ready to repeat the sins of the recent past. The top three M&A deals of 2013 have had unique features that separate them for pre-crisis LBOs. The Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) deal was in part financed with the repatriation of the company's offshore cash, and founder Michael Dell's total equity contribution is roughly four times larger than that of the largest private equity sponsor Silver Lake. The Virgin Media (NASDAQ:VMED) purchase by Liberty Media's John Malone was a strategic buyer expanding his media empire."
The Cyclical And Secular Risks Of The PC Industry,"Jan. 8, 2013 6:13 PM ET","The PC industry is affected by both cyclical trends and secular shifts. Affects on the PC industry funnels though all sub-sectors of the PC industry, including PC manufacturers like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), semiconductors like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advance Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and hard-drive makers like Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NYSE:WDC). This article will look at the cyclical risks (average 3-4 years PC replacement cycle, product upgrade cycles) and secular risks (mobile smartphones and tablets replacing desktops) of investing in the PC industry, and its affects on the various companies within its sub-sectors.Cyclical versus secularWhat does cyclical and secular mean exactly? Broadly speaking, just remember cyclical means short-term and secular means long-term. Keep in mind that you can have both cyclical and secular trends co-exist within an industry.Cyclical means that the industry's growth will go through peaks and troughs. Each growing or declining phase is short-term, because eventually the other side of the equation will come around. For example, industrial or commodity-related industries are high cyclical industries, because they are heavily tied to overall spurts and slowdowns of the economy. Also, think about durable goods such as automobiles, TVs, and desktops/laptops (versus non-durable goods such as food, health and beauty, cleaning products, etc.). Durable goods are typically cyclical, because they have long replacement life cycles (average lives of cars 8-9 years, TVs 6-7 years, computers 3-4 years). If there was a big spike in demand in a given year (peak), then it would take multiple years of slower growth in-between (trough), before the buyers from year one bought replacement products (peak). Non-durable goods companies, such as Proctor and Gamble (NYSE:PG) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), typically are not cyclical because their products have short-shelf life and require you to make purchases regularly (well, besides commodities where you can have significant seasonal and cyclical spikes)."
The Best Way To Invest In Technology,Jan.18.13,"My Seeking Alpha fellow commentator Paulo Santos recently published an article showing how there is something wrong with the market. Paulo compared the performance of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and showed that how fundamental analysis would have indicated Amazon to be down and Apple to the up. However, the market keeps doing just the opposite. Lately Apple has had a ~30% correction while Amazon keeps going up, up, and away.It is precisely things such as this that break the hearts of investors and make them swear off the market. Tech stocks, especially, are like that. Often they completely defy reason. I swore off tech stocks after the 2000 crash. However, I do keep a small position in the best tech stock in the market.What do you think is the best large-cap tech stock to invest in the past 5 years? If you answered Apple or Amazon, or other darlings such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) you would have been wrong. It is not even the story stock of the past few years as smartphones swamped the market, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), nor it is that darling of the 1990s, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). It is the ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:TQQQ).ProShares UltraPro QQQ seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to triple (300%) the daily performance of the NASDAQ-100 Index.So, every day, if the Nasdaq-100 (NASDAQ:QQQ) goes up by 1%, this ETF returns 3%. If the former goes down by 1%, the ETF is down -3%. If Nasdaq-100 is flat, the TQQQ ETF is flat. What would happen if an investor were to invest a dollar in this ETF and held it for 30 years? My model shows that Buffett like returns would be the likely result.But first things first. How has this ETF done lately?"
"Microsoft: 3.1% Dividend Yield, Good Upside, Low Risk",Jan.22.13,"After looking into the valuation of Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) and HP (NYSE:HPQ), I'm turning to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). MS has not been the focus of much attention recently, and has pretty much fallen out of favor with a flat stock price over the past 10 years or so:Source : MorningStarMS looks like an old tech stock, set to follow the way of Nokia (NYSE:NOK) or Dell, ""killed"" by Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) innovations (which will probably eventually lose their appeal to consumers) or by the death of the PC (which I don't believe in).But let's keep to the facts and stick to the numbers…Basic FactsMS's sales and free cash flow are still both increasing, with a record FCF last reported at $29B.Source : MorningStarIt's true that Microsoft has been ""wasting"" some of its free cash flow with acquisitions that were just too expensive (recently: $6.2B depreciation on the aQuantive purchase from 2007, Skype bought for $8.5B). It's also been sitting on a massive $52B of net cash - a big -part of which is likely ""trapped"" through foreign subsidiaries. However, MS has also been massively buying its stock back and pays a dividend.These stock repurchases are relutive (add value to the stock) and allow the FCF / share to increase faster than the FCF in absolute value (x2.5 and x2, respectively, over the past ten years).click to enlarge)"
Texas Hold ‘Em Tournaments And Value Investing,"Apr. 1, 2013 1:24 PM ET","In most casino games one plays against the house; the house writes the rules, enforces the rules, and ensures that the odds are always stacked in their favor. This activity has a negative expected value, and I would classify it as gambling. Value investing is not gambling. When properly understood and implemented, value investing has a positive expected value. In other words, value investors can find situations where they have an advantage and the odds are stacked in their favor. They may not always win, but they are not gambling.I am playing in a poker tournament this week, so I have been thinking about the overlap of my job as a value investor with my strategy as a poker player. Poker, unlike most casino games, is played against other individuals, not the house. So in poker, it's possible to be an advantage player and have a positive expected value.TellsPracticing one's poker face can start youngLike many people, my education on the topic of poker tells started with the great Caro's Book of Poker Tells: The Psychology and Body Language of Poker which teaches you how to read your opponent in order to get an edge. Does anything like that exist in the investing world? Yes it does. Tactical behavior assessment services are used by certain investors to detect whether corporate executives are exaggerating accomplishments, avoiding discussing a topic, or are flat out lying.People are not naturally good at lying. Holding the truth and a lie in one's head at the same time is difficult, uncomfortable, and causes cognitive dissonance that shows up in both verbal and non-verbal signs. There is scientific evidence regarding how to observe and how to exacerbate these signals. In both poker and investing, it can be lucrative to know how to detect deception.Math""If you think the math isn't important, you don't know the right math.""- Chris ""Jesus"" Ferguson, 2000 World Series of Poker championPoker and investing are both about decisions amidst risk and uncertainty, played out in real time. The core of both poker and investing is the maximization of average profit based upon probability. In both activities, intuition is a dangerous guide. Quantitative reasoning, instead, is key to exploiting counterparties. Both rely on the branch of economics known as utility theory. Utility theorists quantify preference orders such that a utility maximizer can determine how to make rational decisions. Making the most money requires that participants maximize the expected value (NYSE:EV) of decisions. To the end of maximizing EV, we use probability distributions in which we study and quantify all possible outcomes as well as their probabilities. The EV of a probability distribution is based upon the numerical value of every possible outcome.What is my takeaway from poker math? My major concern is this: if I could see everyone's cards, what would I do? I judge myself based upon my proximity to that behavior. There will still be losses and there certainly will always be bad cards. Who cares? The key is to have one's decisions approximate expectancy maximization as closely as possible. One should aim for perfect optimization minus only unavoidable constraints. For the investor, the analogous question is this: if you had perfect information, what would you do? Stocks will go up and down and subsequent events will hurt business, but what should your decision be today, assuming perfect information? Make those decisions, as best as you can with the information available.If you want to read more about poker math, I would start with The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic. For further reading two other superb poker books are The Mathematics of Poker and The Theory of Poker.ScaleLiquidity-constrained counterparties make the best opponents. It is much easier to play an advantaged game with more chips. The Professor, the Banker, and the Suicide King: Inside the Richest Poker Game of All Time is a wonderful book about Andy Beal's triumphs at the poker table. Beal is a good poker player, but not one of the greats by professional standards. That being said, he could play a winning game of poker simply by being rich enough, and willing enough to gamble that he threw everyone else off of their games. He turned -EV to +EV by playing well enough with a very strong stack.In the financial markets, large investors have specific advantages based on their size, access, trading cost, timing, etc. Outside passive minority investors (OPMIs) often lose because larger players or insiders can influence a situation. DELL and AUTO are examples of buyouts where management and private equity firms receive a much better deal than outside passive minority shareholders.What does this teach me about investing? It tells me that I always want more liquidity than my counterparties in the capital markets. I always want relatively larger, influential stakes in the companies in which we invest. I look at the ideas that we are considering and, even before picking individual ones for the portfolio, ask myself if we are taking every advantage. Specifically, within the individual security, are we able to position ourselves relative to scale, concentration and liquidity to have an advantage. Anyone who shows up for a fair fight is unprepared, and we never show up unless we have an advantage.PeopleUnsurprisingly, given these overlaps, many of today's top investors are also serious poker players; (the list includes Cliff Asness, Ken Griffin, Jim Simons, Boaz Weinstein, who once won a Maserati playing poker, Steve Cohen, who once quit his job so that he could focus on poker, Peter Muller, David Einhorn, Marc Lasry and of course Andy Beal). Carl Icahn got his start by winning $4,000 playing poker in the army.Disclosure: I am long DELL, AUTO."

Hewlett-Packard Company: Ratio Analysis,Mar. 4.13,"I have been investigating some large cap tech stocks and I am going to discuss those that offer a good return on investment for a value investor. My analysis here is based on the ratios in the financial statements of the Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) over the last 5 years.The HP earnings report came out less than two weeks ago in what was a big week for large cap tech earnings releases with an earnings report announcement from Dell Inc. (NASDAQ:DELL) as well.These are the two long time darlings of the PC business and they went at it for as long as 12 years. Sadly, they both caught up late to the wave of the future - tablets and smart phones. And this has affected bottom lines. Nonetheless, HP has won the battle for now with Meg Whitman coming out on top during the earnings call as opposed to the lackluster performance by Dell management during their earnings call.The truth was that Whitman had the numbers to back her up as opposed to the declining revenues (down 8% year over year) and 19% drop in non-GAAP earnings over the year that Dell had. For HP, its revenues of $28.4B and diluted per share earnings of $0.82 (non-GAAP) beat analyst expectations and HP stock soared 12%.Price Action:Source: DailyFinanceHP stock is on a rebound now after it underperformed the S&P 500 in 2012; as you can see from the chart above it is well over the 100-day MA (moving average) of $15ish. The stock was hovering at a 9-year low after Whitman's speech at the firm's analyst day in October. The stock price declined from $17.13 to $15.94 and at this point I rightly picked it as a bargain stock despite the fact that HP has been on a long-term down trend.Ratios:Price RatiosYearBook ValueGrowthTangible Book ValueGrowthP/BP/E2012 Q4$11.950.25%-$6.118.67%1.39N/A2012 Q3$11.61-28.47%-$6.69-1.36%1.06N/A2012 Q2$16.23-23.04%-$6.6016.98%0.967.672012 Q1$21.095.71%-$7.955.92%1.278.292011$19.955.17%-$8.45-351.87%1.318.022010$18.977.05%-$1.87-206.56%2.4111.582009$17.727.79%-$0.61-6000%3.0516.702008$16.446.93%-$0.0199.5%2.3211.33"
Why Document Security Systems Is My Favorite Speculative Play For 2013,Apr.28.13,"One of my favorite speculative plays for 2013 is Document Security Systems (NYSEMKT:DSS). The year 2013 could be a massive year for DSS and this article will outline why I have been a buyer recently and why I will be adding on any dips.DSS engages in the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of paper and plastic products to protect information from unauthorized scanning, copying and digital imaging in the United States and internationally. The DSS Printing Group segment produces printed materials, such as security paper, vital records, prescription paper, birth certificates, receipts, manuals, identification materials, entertainment tickets, coupons, parts tracking forms, brochures, direct mailing pieces, catalogs, business cards. Its Plastics Group segment manufactures laminated and surface printed cards, including magnetic stripes, bar codes, holograms, signature panels, invisible ink, micro fine printing, guilloche patterns, biometric, radio frequency identification, and watermarks for printed plastic documents.The FutureOn March 15th 2013, DSS announced that its merger with Lexington Technology Group (LTG) is on pace to close Spring 2013. This is right around the corner and presents big potential for the company moving forward. If the company manages this merger, which I believe it will, LTG can bring a strong and proven intellectual property management team and IP investment portfolio that it will focus on monetizing.LTG has two major investments.Bascom research, which pertains to social network data structure, includes six patents and four applications in this field.Virtual agility, which pertains to user configurable platforms used to create sophisticated, integrated applications and includes five patents and five applications in this field.The management team after the merger will consist of a highly-renowned team full of previous successes. Jeff Ronaldi (current CEO of LTG) will serve as the new CEO after the merger. He has over 25 years of experience in company formation and management. He managed Juridica's investment in patent portfolios, whose investment results include a $50 million judgment. Ronaldi was also a former general manager at ImageExpo, which won a $60 million verdict against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and a $10 million verdict against Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS)."
Over-Diversification? Concentrated Holdings Yield Better Results,"Apr. 4, 2013 6:15 AM ET","It's easier to invest $100,000 than it is $100 million. As hedge funds grow, the inherent hurdle they most often encounter is capacity. The larger the fund, the more difficult it becomes to capture the inefficiencies in the market for additional limited partners. It comes down to the semi-exaggerated phrase, ""how can you beat the market, when you are the market."" Nimbleness is a virtue of investment management. The easiest analogy is one of nautical term. A 22-foot ski boat can go from full speed in one direction and complete a 180 degree maneuver in a matter of seconds. A crash stop maneuver (from 'full ahead' to 'full reverse') on a fully-loaded supertanker can take almost two miles over a 14 minutes period. Its turning diameter alone is almost 1.2 miles. Ideally, one would rather be in the investment equivalent of a ski-boat.The same can be said for mutual funds. Popular funds become victims of their own success. Large amounts of capital leads to over-diversification. If you have 20 great ideas, but $780 million to invest, you are either pushed into very large cap names, or large percentage holdings. What truly happens is that you invest a portion of your funds into your best ideas, and then surround those with second-, third-, or even fourth-tier ideas, but in lessor quantity. In the end, those funds end up owning the market and replicating their benchmarks. Each mutual fund prospectus highlights its top 10 holdings, but you must search for total number of holdings.Look at Fidelity (I use them not because they are different than anyone else, but rather, I had their data handy). The median number of holdings in their actively managed funds is 195 positions. Position sizes range from 1,132 holdings in a $2.5 billion fund to 51 positions in their focused fund. Even the ""Blue Chip"" funds have over 300 names. You can find a list of holdings here. Although a fair portion of assets are invested in the top 10-20 holdings, the typical fund's average position size is often less than $1 million per name. There are as many as 100 names that each represent less than 1/2% of the fund holdings, and in aggregate represent 29% of assets."
Spectrum Pharmaceuticals: Here's One Acquisition Rumor That I Wouldn't Mind Chasing,Feb. 5.13,"Any chance I get, I discourage investors from chasing the dream of large gains due to a buyout. These almost never work as planned, and after the initial pop it can take weeks, months, even years for an acquisition to be announced. This is typically an emotional investment on behalf of retail investors, a topic that I have discussed in great detail, and one that is not based on fundamentals. Yet one company that might be entertaining acquisition talks is Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:SPPI), and it might be worth owning.The rumor of an acquisition often creates a great deal of movement. Last Wednesday, Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) CEO Aubrey McClendon announced his retirement and the stock rose over 6%. This is a man who built the largest collection of energy assets in the U.S., yet the prospects of a potential acquisition were far greater than any fundamental loss that could occur. In the last three weeks I have also covered the rumors surrounding both Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) and Zillow (NASDAQ:Z), telling investors how to play the speculation. Because far too often, investors play these rumors wrong, and then lose money when the acquisition does not occur, or when the buy price is less than expectations.While I don't like the idea of buying a stock on the expectations of an acquisition, there is one case in which I think it makes perfect sense, with Spectrum Pharmaceuticals. In my opinion, there are three reasons that make this position attractive: 1) The stock looks to be trending higher and is not accounting for the likelihood of an acquisition, 2) the stock is fundamentally cheap, and 3) the stock is nowhere near its potential buyout price. Before exploring these three reasons, let's look at what sparked the conversation.Acquisition Rumors Starting to BuildOn Tuesday January 29, a report from MSN Money entitled, ""Inside Wall Street: Is Big Pharma eyeing Spectrum?"" was released and the stock rose from $11.55 to over $12.50, before closing at $12.14. The stock made this jump with over one million shares traded in a period of just 12 minutes. These gains, although significant, are nothing compared to the gains that we often see in biotechnology when acquisition rumors begin to spread."
I Wish I Traded IP Stocks Like Hudson Bay,"Apr. 30, 2013 8:18 AM ET","If you want to invest in intellectual property (IP), I suggest you hawk Hudson Bay Capital Management. It is making a killing in IP. I have set real-time reminders for all of its SEC filings, and I am consistently amazed by its activism in this burgeoning sector. Although it typically invests alongside institutional co-investors in private placements, even common shares graph a remarkable history of double- and triple-digit returns.The IP sector is one of the fastest growing sectors on Wall Street. According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, the market for global IP licensing alone grew over 500% in the past two decades to over $180 billion. And that's just licensing. Corporations spend another $20 billion per year transferring IP assets between themselves, and then they sue each other in billion-dollar patent wars à la Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) v. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Funds like Hudson Bay smell easy money in this smorgasbord of business activity and are inviting themselves to dinner.This article examines the IP sector and the broader knowledge-based economy that has enabled funds like Hudson Bay to earn outsized profits during the past few months. I recount Hudson Bay's recent IP winners -- Vringo (VRNG), Spherix (NASDAQ:SPEX) and Worlds (OTCQB:WDDD) -- and some of its current IP holdings like Marathon Patent Group (MARA).Outrageous Profits in IPNever before has IP been so valuable, and never before have so many world class companies been opening their checkbooks to acquire it. The valuation being placed on IP is approaching, dare I say, obscene levels. I have already written about a company trading around $3 per share with price targets as comical as $18 and $100 per share. Sometimes dreams come true, however: investors watched VirnetX (NYSEMKT:VHC) go from $1 to $40 per share solely on the basis of IP (the company had just 11 employees while topping $2 billion in market capitalization). Likewise, AOL (NYSE:AOL) rallied over 40% when it sold its patents to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)."
Building A Magic Formula Dividend Portfolio,"Feb. 25, 2013 5:51 PM ET","With low interest rates in the bond market, many investors are embracing credit risk in the junk bond market or taking on interest rate risk with long-duration bonds.Instead, Joel Greenblatt's Magic Formula can be re-purposed to find attractive stocks that pay dividends. In a prior article, we showed that it could be restricted to picking dividend-paying stocks without detracting from the performance of the Magic Formula. Encouraged by this success, we used this screening method to create a current list of the best dividend stocks to buy in today.This strategy is designed for income investors who are concerned that dividend-yielding stocks are becoming too pricey. It combines a screen for dividend income with Greenblatt's screen for the best stocks trading at the cheapest values.What is the Magic Formula?Joel Greenblatt reported enviable annual 30.8% returns for his ""Magic Formula"" in his book, ""The Little Book that Beats the Market"". Since publishing his book, his strategy has performed well. Though many analysts who have followed the ""Magic Formula"" have not seen 30.8% annual returns, they typically report outperformance from this strategy. His results are particularly interesting because his picks are not subjective: they are based on a simple ranking of earnings yield (EBIT/EV) and return on capital.Even more interesting, Magic Formula stocks have historically outperformed the market with a total portfolio which is a blend of value and growth with a beta of roughly one. This blended profile of Magic Formula picks lends itself to do-it-yourself investors as a core holding strategy. Moreover, since many of these picks have dividend yields, they can be used to create an income portfolio.Screening for Magic Formula Dividend StocksThe following methods were used to extract appropriate dividend-yielding stocks from Greenblatt's Magic Formula results:Stocks were selected using the Magic Formula methodology. Each of these stocks is one of a top-50 selection with a $50 million, $2 billion, or $10 billion market capitalization minimums."
LSI: A Debt Free $7 Tech Stock,Feb.14.13,"LSI Corporation (NASDAQ:LSI-OLD) is a company that designs semiconductors and software that accelerate storage and networking. The company is the market leader in SAS, enterprise RAID, and application acceleration. According to company's website, Industry analysts expect that storage will grow 35% per year for the next several years and network traffic will grow by 33%. The company has growth potential and Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL), LSI's main rival, is being forced to pay a fine that could be in the billions. The stock is currently hovering near 52 week lows, but the company has a promising future.CompetitorsLSI's direct competitors are Marvell, NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), and STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM). LSI stands to gain from Marvell's woes. On December 27th, Marvell announced a $1.2 billion dollar loss to Carnegie Melon University in a patent lawsuit and the award is one of the biggest in U.S. history. On February 11th, it was announced that Marvell could have to pay three times the $1.2 billion jury verdict that the company was ordered to pay in December. LSI will be able to acquire a more significant market share because the patent loss will financially cripple Marvell. Marvell had a larger market capitalization, higher EPS, and the company produced more revenue last year. Despite Marvell's past performance, LSI could become the dominant company in the storage controller market because of Marvell's woes. NXP Semiconductors and STMicroelectronics have larger market capitalizations, but they both have negative net income.FundamentalsThe TTM P/E ratio is currently 20.54, which is the same as the industry average. The forward P/E ratio is 9.99, which is significantly lower than the TTM P/E ratio. One of the biggest positives about this stock is the lack of debt. The debt to equity ratio has remained at 0 since the fall of 2010. One of the biggest downsides is the decline in TTM net income. Net income for the company was $396.53 million in March of 2012, but it fell to 202.66 million by the end of 2012. Quarterly YoY revenue growth is 14.70%. The TTM leveraged free cash flow is $402.09 million. The 5 year earnings growth forecast is 15.93%. The PEG ratio is .95, which could indicate that the company is undervalued. The TTM profit margin is currently 8.09%."
A Look Into Former Berkshire Hathaway Equity Investor Lou Simpson's Concentrated Portfolio,"Jan. 4, 2013 10:01 AM ET","My favorite place to look for investment ideas is in the portfolios of legendary value investors. I figure if a stock has made it through the vetting process of an investor with decades of experience and an outstanding track record then it is worth my time to look at that stock as well.One of the greatest investors of the last half century is a man who has racked up an incredible record investing in equities at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A). No, not Warren Buffett. I'm referring to Lou Simpson, former portfolio manager for Berkshire subsidiary Geico.Simpson retired from Berkshire Hathaway in 2010 and Buffett had some kind words for his departing employee:Last summer, Lou Simpson told me he wished to retire. Since Lou was a mere 74 - an age Charlie and I regard as appropriate only for trainees at Berkshire - his call was a surprise. Lou joined GEICO as its investment manager in 1979, and his service to that company has been invaluable. In the 2004 Annual Report, I detailed his record with equities, and I have omitted updates only because his performance made mine look bad. Who needs that?Lou has never been one to advertise his talents. But I will: Simply put, Lou is one of the investment greats. We will miss him.In the 2004 Berkshire Hathaway letter to shareholders Buffett gave us a look at Simpson's 24 years of investment performance managing Geico's equity portfolio:If you click on the extract from the 2004 Berkshire letter and enlarge it you can more clearly see that Simpson compounded money at an astounding 20.3% per annum.Most of us would be thrilled with half of that these days.Upon retiring Simpson did not rest for long as he started his own investment firm SQ Advisors. This for the first time allows us to examine directly the actual portfolio being managed by Simpson. And I think looking in that portfolio for investment ideas is well worth the time and effort."
Forrester Report Says Apple Will Sell $39 Billion In Macs And iPads To Businesses Over Next 2 Years,Jan. 4.13,"By Alex WilliamsForrester Research is reporting that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will sell $39 billion in Macs and iPads through 2014.According to the firm's latest report, Apple will sell $7 billion worth of Macs and $11 billion in iPads to the corporate market this year. In 2014, Apple will sell $8 billion in Macs and $13 billion in iPads.Forrester Analyst Andrew Bartels said to me in an email interview that Apple is having success in the corporate market for three reasons:Good products that employees want to use, and feel proud when their firm provides them.Best-in-class tablets in the iPad, which firms turn to first for tablets.A corporate sales organization that has been responsive to business demand and delivers competitive prices.Apple's dominance and the market shift to mobile will make the enterprise workflow for getting work done one of the most highly competitive in the enterprise market. That's evident from the acquisitions last fall in the bring your own device (BYOD) market: Citrix acquired Zenprise and Dell purchased Cedant.Here's Gartner's Magic Quadrant for the mobile device market:Apple is reportedly developing a workflow, too. Reports surfaced In October that Apple's iWork suite will be integrated with VMware Horizon, the company's suite of applications that creates a virtual environment on the phone to partition work from personal data.The rest of the market pales in comparison. But Android's growth does show how the mobile market is taking shape."
A 'Superabundance Of Capital' ... But Not For Economic Growth,"Feb. 12, 2013 2:57 PM ET","""Bain & Company, the consultancy, forecasts a 'superabundance of capital' between now and 2020. In a recent report it argued that markets would be distorted by surpluses in Asian and Middle Eastern countries and private investment funds.""It estimates that the world's financial assets will outbalance its domestic product by ten to one - it will have $900 trillion of financial assets compared with $90 trillion of GDP - by 2020. The result will be a 'world that is structurally awash in capital' chasing few opportunities.""'Capital superabundance will increase the frequency, intensity, size and longevity of asset bubbles. The propensity for bubbles to form will be magnified as yield-hungry investors race to put capital into assets that show the potential to generate superior returns,' the report concludes.""These words from John Gapper appeared over the weekend in the Financial Times of London.The signs of this possibility, according to Gapper, are two: first, the presence of lots and lots of cash on the balance sheets of corporations, hedge funds, and other financial interests; and second, the apparent movement in the buyout and acquisition market that reflects a growing belief among international investors that the US economy is stabilizing, the eurozone crisis has reached its final stages, and that elsewhere in the world economic recovery continues and capital flows are increasing. Apparently with these events, the desire to take on more risk has risen.I have written for three years or so about the build up of cash on the balance sheets of corporations. Companies that never had issued long-term debt before took advantage of exceedingly low interest rates to increase their cache of money. The basic reasoning behind this buildup was that these financially sound firms would ""make a killing"" as the United States economy began to grow faster and government regulatory policy came together.The targets of these companies? The answer was ... companies that were not so financially sound; companies that needed restructuring; and companies that needed new life and new capital."
Dr. Oz Protege Would Wizard Herbalife Products,"Apr. 1, 2013 1:20 PM ET","Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) is a marketing company with a vast distribution channel organization that can quickly bring to market a compelling health related product, especially if endorsed by a known expert in the health industry. One such expert we think would be perfect would is Dr. Oz, who is a part of Oprah Winfrey Network and regarded as one of her Allstars. While Dr. Oz may not be available because of his involvement with Weight Watchers (NYSE:WTW), but one of his showcased nutrition focused Doctors such as Dr. Tasneem Bhatia, Dr. Denise Bruner or others numerous who have been popular guests on his television episodes may just do the trick for Herbalife. We have not spoken to these Doctors but have spoken to one Doctor and hypothetically asked the question if he or she was interested in a deal with HLF and the answer was yes.We all have seen the tremendous bull and bear battle between Carl Icahn and his former friend David Ackman on the battlefield named Herbalife.Maybe, just maybe, Ackman has given HLF a very good chance to move the HLF to a higher level. Something Cisco's John Chambers describes as a ""near-death experience"" in an interview describing a series of conversations he had with Jack Welch.So maybe this is the proverbial ""silver lining"" in this saga for HLF. In HLF's case, a great product and a great endorsement by a celebrity doctor would do wonders for their marketing troops. If Dr. Oz of afternoon syndicated network TV fame were to get behind a line of products or for that matter one of the Doctors he has ""blessed"" on his show may do the trick as well. The line could include all of the new natural appetite suppressants such as green coffee bean extract, raspberry ketones, saffron extract and the Akai berry juice all under a celebrity Doctors protocol, this could be a blockbuster.We are long HLF because we like the management team led by Michael O Johnson, who led Walt Disney International before coming to HLF. Michael certainly knows how to sign up ""celebrities"" with his background.We want to look at the current short interest from NASDAQ:As you can see, the short interest went down by approximately 1.172 million shares and 17 thousand shares in the last two reporting periods respectively. But the days to cover ratio went up because of the drop in average daily volume. Clearly the stock's short interest is at elevated levels since the Ackman short campaign. The stock is subject to a squeeze at any time if Carl Icahn wants to take it private or has some other high dividend or spinoff possibility to payout shareholders. We checked with our short desks and found the negative rebate on borrowing the stock is 2.5 to 3% annual cost to borrow. One large firm does not have any available which shows that some holders of the stock are starting to recall their shares into cash accounts.Legal and Miscellaneous IssuesOne of our SA followers has filed a complaint with the SEC against Ackman. Here is an excerpt from his complaint:""... I noticed earlier today that the first search result when Google'ing ""Herbalife"" is the following: ""Herbalife-Pyramid Scheme? -factsaboutherbalife.com"". Ackman's campaign link is displayed before the company's website when searching on Google! This just does not seem right to me. Ackman's scheme has developed into an advertising campaign.""We checked ourselves and found the following:The placement had moved to number two. But, he is right because the shaded areas are ""paid for placements"" on Google. We will keep you posted on his complaint with the SEC on this matter which he also claims is market manipulation of HLF by Ackman. Perhaps he can post it in its entirety as a comment on this article.Many here on SA have opined on the business practices of HLF. Here are two recent negative and positive articles respectively:Herbalife: 5 Common Sense ArgumentsThe World Is Fat: The Law Of Supply And Demand And The Western DietThe first article tries to articulate a pyramid scheme for HLF, as he says,""leads me to conclude that Herbalife is engaged in a pyramid scheme which is a form of ""business opportunity"" fraud."" We think he is wrong. HLF has been mired in disputes numerous times since its founding in 1980 by Mark Hughes and documented in Wikipedia and has survived. Currently, it has a SEC investigation underway. People are enchanted by the ""pyramid scheme"" or maybe more so with ""Ponzi scheme"". We think pointing to Cyprus for the moment is appropriate. No, it's not the next HLF territory. Look at the banks. They take peoples deposits. But when everyone wants their money at the same time, they can't possibly perform. Are they a ""pyramid scheme"". Isn't that what Ackman tried to do with HLF by falsely accusing them of being a fraud?He tried to create panic. Is HLF an aggressive marketer? Is it vastly different than Avon, Amway, Tupperware or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) invite your friends campaign for that matter? We think not. In fact, Ackman looks to us as the ""boy who cried wolf"" for an apparent altruistic cause which we still can't discern.ConclusionThe short squeeze capability in Herbalife can come at any moment. It's a buy for sure and not a short. Maybe Carl Icahn is using his pursuit of Dell Computer (NASDAQ:DELL) as a decoy to amass more shares of HLF at cheaper prices and simultaneously making Ackman thinks he is distracted.Disclosure: I am long HLF."
Apple: Cheaper Phone Means Cheaper Stock?,Jan.16.13,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), longtime maker of Macs and more recently the producer of iPods, iPhones, and iPads, has suffered a serious setback in stock price. From the week of the last iPhone launch, shares have been on a slide:One might attribute some of this to headlines highlighting Android's gains in unit share, but honestly: Apple's history hasn't been a story of success through unit share dominance. And with Samsung potentially shifting its products' operating system to Tizen, the story of platform market share as some sort of profit predictor will look even less appealing for Android as an Apple competitor: no Android OEM other than Samsung makes any money in the cutthroat mobile business.Something else is behind Apple's slide. Perhaps - as some suggest - Apple is doomed to descend into low-margin competition to make profitless commodity products, like nearly everyone else.Will Cheap Products Doom Apple?Writing for TheStreet.com, Rocco Pendola declared that a ""Cheaper Apple iPhone Would Trigger Tim Cook's Departure."" Although a long-term bear on Apple, Mr. Pendola has one thing dead-on right: Apple and its iPhone products are all about maintaining a certain level of user experience. So, is he right? He says that an Apple iPhone-lite will, if anything, be a little smaller and lower-cost but not ""cheap,"" and predicts it will play out like the iPad … and presumably the iPad Mini, which many derided as overpriced to compete with Kindle and Nexus but which nevertheless are selling like hotcakes. But that's Mr. Pendola's point: Apple didn't succeed with a product everyone agreed was ""cheap,"" it succeeded with a product everyone said wasn't cheap enough.Besides: the very week Apple was reported to have a ""cheap"" iPhone in the works, the stock tanked:"
CITIC Capital's Take Private Deal For AsiaInfo-Linkage: Is This An LBO The Chinese Way?,May.16.13,"Are we seeing the birth of ""Leveraged Buyouts With Chinese Characteristics""? Or just some of the craziest, riskiest and unlikeliest buyout deals in worldwide history? That's the question posed by the announcement this week that China buyout PE firm CITIC Capital Partners is leading the ""take private"" deal of NASDAQ-listed AsiaInfo-Linkage Inc (NASDAQ:ASIA), a Chinese software and telecommunications services that company whose shares have halved in value from over $20 during the last two years.CITIC Capital first disclosed in January 2011 its intention to buy out the AsiaInfo-Linkage public shareholders. At the time, the share price was around $7. The board set up a committee to search for alternative buyers. It seems to have found none, and accepted this week CITIC's offer to pay $12 a share, or 50% above the price on the day in January 2011 when it first notified the company of its interest. That seemed a rich premium 17 months ago. It seems no less so now.Rule Number One in LBOs: Do not pay any more than you absolutely need to to acquire a majority of the shares. Few are the M&A deals where a premium of +50% is offered. Fewer still when the target company is one where the stock has been seriously battered for many years now. The share price went into something like a free fall in early 2010, from a high of $30 to reach that level of $7 when CITIC Capital first announced its move.CITIC Capital is buying AsiaInfo-Linkage at a price that equates to well over 20 times its 2012 earnings. That sort of p/e multiple is rarely seen in buyout deals. (Dell's buyout is priced at half that level, a p/e of 10X, and a premium of 25% above the share price the day before rumors about the ""take private"" deal started to spread.)It's one of the exquisite oddities of this current craze to take Chinese companies private that PE firms are willing to pay p/e multiples to buy distressed quoted companies from U.S. investors at prices that are at least twice what the same PE firms generally say they will pay for a perfectly-healthy private Chinese company located in China. If anything, the reverse should be true."
Dell Inc. Bonds: How Much Risk And How Much Return?,Jul.24.13,"In this note we analyze the current levels and past history of default probabilities for Dell Inc. (NASDAQ:DELL) and we compare those default probabilities to credit spreads on 292 bond trades in 8 different bond issues on July 22, 2013. Trading volume in Dell Inc. bonds on that day totaled $37.3 million. Assuming the recovery rate in the event of default would be the same on all bond issues, a sophisticated investor who has moved beyond legacy ratings seeks to maximize revenue per basis point of default risk from each incremental investment, subject to risk limits on macro-factor exposure on a fully default-adjusted basis. We analyze the maturities where the credit spread/default probability ratio is highest for Dell Inc. We also consider whether or not a reasonable investor would judge the firm to be ""investment grade"" under the June 2012 rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010.Definition of Investment GradeOn June 13, 2012, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency published the final rules defining whether a security is ""investment grade,"" in accordance with Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. The new rules delete reference to legacy credit ratings and replace them with default probabilities. The web page explaining the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's new rules defining investment grade and related guidance can be found here.Term Structure of Default ProbabilitiesMaximizing the ratio of credit spread to matched maturity default probabilities requires that default probabilities be available at a wide range of maturities. The graph below shows the current default probabilities for Dell Inc. ranging from one month to 10 years on an annualized basis. The default probabilities range from 0.36% at one month to 0.17% at 1 year and 0.78% at ten years."

We compare Dell Inc. default probabilities to credit spreads on 203 bond trades in 10 different bond issues with principal value of $28.7 million on October 21, 2013. We continue to find that Dell Inc. bonds offer a slightly better than average ratio of credit spread to default probability risk, although the firm's default probabilities have shifted slightly since our last report.

Dell And HP Beat Apple On PC Market Share Growth,Oct.18.13,"According to a recent report from research firm IDC, for the first time in recent memory, both Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) beat Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in terms of quarter market share growth. Where Apple lost 11.2%, Dell saw market share tick up by 2.3%, while HP added 3.5%.

Dell Inc. Bonds: Tallying The Losses,"Nov. 28, 2013 2:34 AM ET","In this update of our October 23, 2013 analysis, we track the impact on Dell Inc. bond holders of the close of the merger agreement with Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners. In this note, we re-analyze the credit spreads for Dell Inc. We look at data for 262 bond trades in 8 different Dell Inc. bond issues with principal value of $88.2 million on November 26, 2013. In our October 23 post, we declined to forecast the behavior of one individual, Michael Dell, in favor of waiting to see what he does. Our analysis shows that bond holders of Dell Inc. have lost a substantial amount of value as Dell and his partners intentionally raised the probability of bankruptcy and the volatility of returns to equity holders (themselves) by aggressively leveraging the firm in an industry where leverage is rare for a reason.This drop in long-maturity bond value came about after the buyout of Dell Inc. closed on October 29, financed in part by a loan of $7.2 billion. The firm's legacy ratings were downgraded to junk by three legacy rating agencies on February 5, September 11, and October 30. This article shows that the greatest losses since trading on October 21 have come at maturities of 15 years and longer.Background to the Analysis of Dell Inc.Institutional investors around the world are required to prove to their audit committees, senior management, and regulators that their investments are in fact ""investment grade.""

In this report, IBM's hardware segment's performance will be compared with competitors Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ), and Dell Inc. (NASDAQ:DELL). Is IBM's poor performance company specific, or is the hardware industry going through a period of declining revenue? How does IBM's performance compare to competitors?In the first section, the components of the hardware segments of the companies will be covered. The second section covers the historic performance of the hardware segments. The final section discusses the historic performance of the hardware segments.The recent performance of the hardware segments were poor, generally.

The Billionaires: 2013 Results For Some Of America's Richest,"Dec. 20, 2013 11:00 AM ET","One billion dollars in $100 bills:The difference between $999,999,999 and $1 billion is a lot more than $1. With $1 less than $1 billion, you are just some guy but with $1 billion, you become ""billionaire X"" for the rest of your life or at least the rest of your life unless you manage to lose your billion dollars. Our political debate is dominated by a choice to demonize and envy such people on one side or to learn, copy and someday to join them on the other. As Charlie Munger said,What good is envy? It's the one sin you can't have any fun at. It's 100% destructive.Prof. Thomas Sowell said that,I have never understood why it is 'greed' to want to keep the money that you've earned, but not greed to want to take someone else's money.So, I will leave the demonizing and envying to others and will instead focus on learning and copying. It has been a fine year for America's top billionaires. According to a recent study from Wealth-X, these are the top gainers for 2013:It should almost go without saying that all figures are in US$ billion.Unlike wealth gained though salaries or inheritance, most of these gains were through the capital markets. While capital markets may increase inequality (because everyone increasing a given percentage increases the difference between individual wealth), they also are more replicable than other forms of wealth creation."
Memo To Intel Bulls: You People Are Dead Wrong,Sep.10.13,"On October 26, 1999, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) were both added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average as component stocks. This event arguably marked the apex of the PC Revolution as a driver of the technology economy. Accounting for splits, Intel then traded for $27.53 per share, while also operating with 8.7 million shares of common stock outstanding on its balance sheet. Heading into Q4 1999, Intel executives managed a corporation carrying $240 billion in market capitalization. On September 6, 2013, Intel stock closed out the trading session at $22.67, after claiming 5 million shares of common stock outstanding within its latest Q3 2013 financial report. This recent stock market performance calculates out to roughly $110 billion in Intel market capitalization. In fourteen years, the size of Intel's business has literally been slashed in half.Intel management decisions to return larger amounts of capital back to investors, in the form of dividends and stock buybacks have done nothing for shareholder growth. Over the past twenty-four months, Intel has shifted its focus towards aggressive research and development spending, in order to finally establish a beachhead within a mobile chip market dominated by the ARM - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) alliance. Intel bulls are now arguing their case on two fronts. Firstly, the Intel bulls reason that extraordinary R&D spending is artificially depressing net income. Secondly, Intel cheerleaders assume R&D spending to be an up-front investment that will automatically materialize into future growth. Time, however, will prove that R&D spending at Intel is no panacea for growth, because the corporation now operates out of desperation. The situation is similar to a middling NFL franchise throwing money at a fee agent bust - in misguided hopes of exciting fans. Intel is still a strong sell.Intel R&D Spending By The NumbersBe advised that Intel fiscal years generally parallel calendar years. In 1999, during the halcyon days of the PC Revolution, Intel closed out the year with $7.3 billion in net income on $29.4 billion in revenue. Intel had grown net income by 20.5% over the prior year - to cap off a decade that began with a relatively meager $650 million in profits. Between 1997 and 1999, Intel spent 9.8% of annual revenue upon research and development, on average. This R&D allocation was largely in line with the rest of Intel's 1990's growth decade. At most, Intel spent a shade more than 13% of revenue in 1990 and 1992."
Where Have All The Apple Skeptics Gone?,Oct.25.13,"One thing I have noticed over the past three months and especially since the successful launch of the new 5S & 5C versions of the iPhone in Mid-September is that the skeptics of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) seemed to have disappeared into the woodwork. Of course, a stock chart like the one below tends to silence pessimists.(Click to enlarge)I don't know about most Apple investors, but I kind of miss all the ""Has Apple lost its Mojo?"", ""Why Apple misses Steve Jobs"" and ""Is Tim Cook the right man to lead Apple?"" stories that were a hallmark of the financial press as the shares fell from a high of $705 a share in September of last year to under $400 a share in late June.The contrarian in me always feels better when a major investment of mine is treated to at least some skepticism. Other than the recent rapid rise in the stock price, the pessimism around the stock has receded for three major reasons.Evolutionary turns out to be ""good enough""One of the main themes of Apple skeptics prior to its recent rise in the stock was that the company could not innovate without Steve Jobs. Furthermore, they postulated Apple needed to develop a killer product in a new category (iTV or iWatch as examples) to get out of its funk.This thesis turned out to be embarrassing false. What the company needed to do was to have a successful launch of the new versions of its iPhones where it gets ~70% of its revenue from. Apple did add a neat new fingerprint sensor, a faster chip and longer battery life with the new 5S; but none of these new features could possibly be called ""revolutionary"".However, they turned out to be enough to ensure that Apple had the most successful launch of any of its versions of the iPhone to date. Initial weekend sales came in at 9mm versus the consensus calling for 5mm to 6mm units. Even better is it appears the new iPhones and the huge volume of sales they are driving will allow the company to arrest the recent year long decline in margins. This has caused analysts to up earnings estimates and raise price targets over the last month. It turns out ""evolutionary"" change isn't so bad after all."
The9's Privatization Outlook - Profits Eyed In Q4,Jul.17.13,"The9 (NASDAQ:NCTY) has spent more than $300 million over the past 5 years to develop its next generation of games. Stock price has fallen from $52 in 2007 to $3 today and $1.2 billion of market cap has been wiped out. Now finally, several major games will be launched during the second half of 2013. The9 is expected to return to profitability in 4Q 2013. Yet shareholders are losing faith and are selling shares at low levels. On the other hand, the Chairman / CEO Jun Zhu has been working on a potential privatization deal and has done share buyback aggressively. In addition, he purchased shares personally and aggressively. Shareholders with enough risk appetite should hold on to their tickets while preparing for the possibility of an upturn.The9 still has $89 million ($3.63 per share) of cash on its balance sheet. In addition, the company purchased its 14,000-square-meter office building in March 2007 in Pudong New Area in Shanghai. The building alone is currently worth more than $50 million ($2 per share) and its value grows at approximately 15%-20% per year. The company has almost no debt. Yet the entire market cap of The9 is now below $70 million, which is almost a rounding error compared to its market cap of $1.2 billion in 2007. The stock is trading below cash. In other words, at the current price, shareholders get the building for free, plus a pipeline of major games costing more than $300 million ($12.25 per share).The Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) situation has some similarities to that of The9. Dell's PC business is declining. And while it spends a lot of money on acquiring enterprise software and services businesses, the acquisition spending lowers net income and the payoff can be several years away."
Will Generic Competitors Of Enbrel Affect Amgen's Stock Price?,Jun.14.13,"A recent clinical study comparing Enbrel with three generic drugs showed comparable efficacy and safety in rheumatoid arthritis patients (Therapies for Active Rheumatoid Arthritis after Methotrexate Failure NEJM 061113). Importantly, the cost of the triple therapy is $1000 compared with $25,000 for Enbrel. This begs the question of whether a switch to a generic combination, in the face of looming healthcare costs, might reduce future sales for Enbrel (and other anti-TNF therapy). Here we assess Enbrel's impact on Amgen's (NASDAQ:AMGN) bottom line and its stock price. Using scenario analysis, our projection estimates that AMGN's intrinsic stock price is $117 if Enbrel sales grow at a 6% annual rate. However, in the worst case scenario, if Enbrel sales decline by 15% per year, AMGN's intrinsic stock price becomes $98. It appears that the market is factoring in the worst case scenario as AMGN is currently trading around $97-$98. We provide some arguments supporting the scenario that Enbrel sales will maintain modest growth, thus supporting a value above $98.We published an article on Amgen in April 2013 in which we described 4 factors contributing to AMGN's future earnings growth (Four Factors Driving Amgen's Stock Price To $102). One of the factors is the expiration of Amgen's partnership with Pfizer to co-promote Enbrel in the United States and Canada in November 2013. The termination of the partnership means that Amgen will keep the majority of future profits from Enbrel sales, which are estimated to add ~$800M of operating income to Amgen's income statement in 2014 and beyond. Under the assumption that Enbrel sales grow at a 6% annual rate, we derived an intrinsic value for AMGN stock price to be $117 using projected earnings growth and the discounted cash flow model (Our Model Suggests An Intrinsic Value Of $117 For Amgen).However, the Wall Street Journal recently reported an article citing a clinical study that raised concerns about future prospects for anti-TNF drugs, including Enbrel , Remicade (NYSE:JNJ), Simponi , Humira (NYSE:ABBV), and Cimzia (UCB) (AMGN Enbrel faces challenge from generic drug combination WSJ 061213, Therapies for Active Rheumatoid Arthritis after Methotrexate Failure NEJM 061113)."
25 Top Cash-Rich S&P 500 Non-Financial Companies,"Jun. 2, 2013 4:50 AM ET","Large U.S. companies hold billions of dollars in cash and cash-equivalents on their balance sheets. The largest of these 83 companies hold over $1.46 Trillion off-shore beyond the reach of the U.S. government according to a report by Bloomberg in March this year. Companies are hoarding such huge piles of cash overseas since they do not want to pay taxes if repatriated back home.They also hold high amounts cash and equivalents in the U.S., as they are unable to invest them in productive ways.While it would be better for all stakeholders if they put this cash hoard to work by building factories and expanding locally and globally, nowadays management and the boards that are supposed to monitor them in many firms are incompetent, selfish and lazy. They would rather waste shareholder wealth on share buybacks, acquisitions or simply help themselves by dipping into the cookie jar with outrageous pay packages, bonuses, stock options and other legally-allowed compensation schemes.The table below lists the Top 25 S&P 500 Non-Financial Companies by Cash & Short-Term Investments held on their balance sheets:S.No. Company Ticker Dividend Yield as of May 31, 2013 Cash ($Mil.) as of May 15, 2013 Sector1 General Electric GE 3.23% 79,390 Industrials2 Microsoft MSFT 2.68% 74,483 Technology3 Google GOOG N/A 50,098 Technology4 Cisco CSCO 2.89% 46,376 Technology5 Amgen AMGN 1.78% 42,075 Health Care6 Apple AAPL 2.74% 39,137 Technology7 Oracle ORCL 0.70% 33,407 Technology8 Pfizer PFE 3.31% 32,708 Health Care9 Ford F 2.70% 32,010 Discretionary10 Johnson & Johnson JNJ 3.04% 21,089 Health Care11 WellPoint WLP 1.95% 20,857 Health Care12 Chevron CVX 3.19% 19,048 Energy13 Coca-Cola KO 2.65% 18,428 Staples14 Intel INTC 3.75% 17,073 Technology15 Merck MRK 3.65% 16,141 Health Care16 UnitedHealth UNH 1.37% 16,088 Health Care17 Abbott Labs ABT 1.48% 15.174 Health Care18 QUALCOMM QCOM 2.18% 13,493 Technology19 Hewlett-Packard HPQ 2.36% 13,012 Technology20 Dell DELL 2.40% 12,777 Technology21 IBM IBM 1.85% 11,993 Technology22 Boeing BA 1.83% 11,853 Industrials23 Freeport-McMoRan FCX 4.11% 9,595 Materials24 Humana HUM 1.37% 9,539 Health Care25 eBay EBAY N/A 9,402 Technology"
A Value Investor's Dream: Chemed Corporation,Nov. 5.13,"Chemed Corporation (NYSE:CHE) is the parent company of two subsidies: 1) Roto-Rooter and 2) VITAS. Roto-Rooter operates through 110 company-owned branches and independent contractors, and over 400 franchisees. VITAS focuses on curative hospice care that helps make terminally ill patients' final days as comfortable and pain free as possible. The question is: how can the parent's management be effective operating in two distinct industries?One thing is certain though: Chemed Corporation isn't the next Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B). Similar to Berkshire though, the company is a cash generating machine, posting $17.4m, $14.6m, $22.2m, and $26.7m in net income, the past four quarters, on a US GAAP basis. On an Adjusted EBITDA basis the company made $201.4m in 2012, $197.3m in 2011, and $189.4m in 2010. And, as the years have passed (no pun intended), management has decided to repurchase the company's shares.The number of shares outstanding since 2010 has steadily been decreasing as the Board of Directors has announced share buybacks of $70m in 2010, $100m in February 2011, $100m on November 2011, and more recently another $100m in February 2013. The share count as of December 31, 2012 was 19.3 million. The Chemed share buyback program almost seems like that of some tobacco companies; given enough years, there'll be no more shares to buy back!As a market participant I know from past market activity if an activist investor wants to split up a company, the activist will start with purchasing common shares. Chemed is low hanging fruit so to speak for an activist, and with such a low share count, volume activity will be noticeable and the common shares will rise.Caution AheadCash generator, share buy backs, shareholder friendly...is Chemed Corporation to good too be true? As a deep value investor, I enjoy a good scandal at a company as it provides a great opportunity to buy shares cheaply. Upon further research, VITAS, the hospice care subsidy, has faced allegations of committing fraud by falsifying the acute care diagnosis of patients, which has led to improper reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid. Lying to the federal government is obviously a serious offense and has its downside. But since these allegations have surfaced in early 2005 and more recently May 2013, I would be hard-pressed to think management or the BOD have no controls in place to mitigate the risks of improper billings and/or improper patient diagnoses, given the allegation are eight years old."
Intel: What About McAfee?,Aug. 6.13,"Back in August 2010, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) bought McAfee software for $7.6 billion. The company has been taking heavy duty ""steam"" from analysts and shareholders ever since. On the day of the purchase, the stock sold off by 3.5%, hardly a vote of confidence for Paul Otellini and the Intel board of directors who voted for the deal.Being a hardware guy, utterly fascinated by the fact that Intel can repeatably make widgets whose dimensions are measured in billionths of a meter, I really didn't know or care what they intended to do with McAfee. I just assumed that a group of people who could do the magic of making extremely complex integrated circuits containing billions of transistors must have a good reason for buying a software company.Now, this is back in the day when the Sandy Bridge was the new thing on the block, made on the new 32nm process. We hadn't heard about 22nm yet, and certainly not the 22nm Trigate process that was soon to come. Those in the know understood that the linking of Intel processors and McAfee's software more closely could finally thwart those warped people who write malware that infects your computer through the Internet. In the world I would design, those who purposely infect your computers with viruses and employ phishing technology to steal your identity would be committing a capital crime with commensurate sanctions should they get caught.Intel, with the McAfee purchase, promised to end all this forever. The anti-virus software available is so bad and slows computers so badly that it is not much better than a virus itself. The Intel solution talked about doing the antivirus work in the processor itself. This would make the antivirus magic so fast as to be undetectable to the average computer user like me. Intel promised zero day protection, and got even more steam from the software people for presuming to do such a thing.We are three years out from that huge acquisition. Sandy Bridge has come and gone. Ivy Bridge (Sandy Bridge on 22nm) has come and gone. Even Otellini is gone! We now have Haswell, the first processor with the hardware hooks that will allow the security promise to become reality. In the middle of May 2013, McAfee introduced LiveSafe, a cross platform universal security package:"
Uni-Pixel: UniBoss Looking To Be Another Failure For The Company,Jul. 2.13,"Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) has been one of the more volatile stocks during the fast half of 2013, having traded as high as $41 just around two months ago before crashing down over 60% to the current price range of $14-$15. However, many of my colleagues and I still see significant downside and risks ahead for the company. We feel the stock rose on nothing but hype from over-promotion of the stock and over-bullish statements from the company's management and longs which do not truly reflect the business fundamentals. Even at the current prices the stock is still drastically overvalued and has much further room to fall since UniBoss may not be a viable product for commercial production. There are signs that history may repeat itself and UniBoss will just be another failure like past Uni-Pixel products.Uni-Pixel - A History of FailuresWe feel investors should take a closer look at the company's past and see why the company and its management should definitely not be given the benefit of the doubt. Nor should investors put much faith in any current claims made by the company.Uni-Pixel initially became publicly traded on the OTC board through a reverse merger with a company called Real-estateforlease.com in 2006. The documents for the merger plan can be found here. Uni-Pixel itself had nothing to do with the online real estate business. Real-estateforlease.com has long been a defunct company ever since 2002 with no operations and assets. It was a just a shell company trading over the counter. The reverse merger was solely done so Uni-Pixel can become publicly traded and later move to the Nasdaq in 2010.The reverse merger is the same backdoor technique used by many of the fraudulent Chinese stocks to go public in the US. This is due to the fact that they cannot become public through a traditional IPO. A simple due diligence from the investment banks during the IPO process would have shown their operations to be fraudulent and/or highly questionable. Therefore they use the reverse merger technique which requires no scrutiny from any outside parties to become public and then later they can sell shares through secondaries to con money from US investors."
Oracle: A Great Long-Term Stock Investment For Patient Investors,Oct.25.13,"Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) is still the world's largest seller of enterprise software. It has more than 400,000 big and small corporate clients across 140 countries. It has a solid history of annual growth for the last three decades. The company is the undisputed leader in providing corporate database management to the biggest corporations in the world.The company's recent diversification toward cloud-based and hardware-based services has dampened investors' enthusiasm for it. Oracle's move toward creating revenue streams outside its proven core Software as a Service expertise is seen as a high-risk act by many. Based on recent analysts' stock reports, majority of them rated Oracle as not a good ""short-term investment.""Risk AssessmentOracle itself admitted in its annual report that it is vulnerable to several risk factors. As per the annual PDF report, ""Our limited experience with managing our hardware business and forecasting its future financial results creates additional challenges with our forecasting processes."" Oracle's management warns its investors that, at the moment, the company is open to uncontrollable risks as it expands its business. New competitors, unforeseen technology innovations and international government actions offer unpredictable threats to the profitability of Oracle.Due to this confession of the company's exposure to new risks, analysts are predicting a poor stock performance for Oracle for this year. Some of them even strongly advised a sell order for Oracle shares as soon as possible to minimize short-term losses.Short-Term EffectDue to the high-risk valuation for Oracle, several of its key stock investors have recently dumped their shares. Even company insiders have sold a substantial part of their Oracle share holdings - farther worsening the gloomy outlook of the company. For the last 30 days, several Oracle employees have dumped more than 525,000 shares in the market. For 2013, more than 5.2 million shares held by company insiders have been sold. And since January no Oracle employee has bought any share of the company."
"If You Are An Apple Lover, You Shouldn't Miss Corning",Sep.16.13,"Gorilla glass panels, revolutionary display glass panels, have seen demand growth due the boom in smartphone and tablet sales. As the name suggests, this glass is durable and provides scratch resistance features. Since its launch by Corning (GLW) in 2007, major smartphone and tablet manufacturers have used this glass as the display panel. To maintain its growth streak, the company is attempting to expand from smartphones and tablets to touch notebooks and markerboards.Gorilla is out of the cage! Can it continue its bull run?Source: Company websiteCorning, a world leader in specialty glass, launched Gorilla Glass NBT for touch enabled Notebooks on July 29, 2013. This type of glass provides 10 times more scratch resistance than glass previously used in devices. With annual sales surpassing $1 billion last year, this glass has been used by every major device manufacturer including Apple (AAPL), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), HTC, etc.To continue its growth in device display glass, the company has entered the touch notebook market. These panels are expected to cost as low as 2% of the notebooks retail price, therefore manufacturers can use these glass panels without a major change in their cost. Dell is the first computer manufacturer to adopt this new glass in their upcoming touch notebook, and due to its cost effective advantages, more notebook manufacturers are expected to follow suit.The touch notebook market is an emerging market with sales estimated to be around 10%-15% of the 188 million laptop sales in 2013, as per IDC. Therefore, at an estimation of 15%, 28 million touch notebooks will be shipped this year.At an average price of $750 for each touch notebook, this glass panel will cost $15 per unit. Gorilla glass had achieved 20% cell phone market share from 2007-2010. Assuming that total touch enabled sales remain constant in the next year, then 20% market share new Gorilla glass NBT is expected to achieve revenue of $85 million in 2014. Gorilla glass has been adopted in 1.5 billion devices, and with adoption in touch notebooks, this figure is expected to rise."
"Samsung And Microsoft Have Winning Strategies, Apple Has Some Strategic Decisions To Make","Nov. 25, 2013 7:20 AM ET","The hot spots for growth in smart connected devices are smartphones and tablets. No surprise there.Geographically, the bulk of the growth will take place in emerging markets, and in particular in China and India. No surprise there, again.The theory of the case for a while has been that the opportunity for smartphone suppliers has been to convert feature phone users to smartphones and in particular for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) now that it has purchased the handset business of Nokia with its massive worldwide share of feature phones. Microsoft has placed a lot of emphasis on Europe and emerging markets for its Lumia line of Windows OS smartphones, the latest of which were launched in Abu Dhabi rather than New York. Lumias have so far enjoyed only limited success in North America. At the same time, smartphone suppliers including Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), Micromax and Nokia (NYSE:NOK) have included a tablet or hybrid offering in their portfolio, and with the emergence of ""phablets"" the lines between these devices have become blurred.One can summarize the implicit strategies of each of the major smartphone platforms in a few lines.

Intel IDF Report Day 2 And The Outlook For 2014 Earnings,Sep.11.13,"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) did not stop making itself felt at the International Developers' Forum (IDF) in San Francisco when it announced that it was shipping 22nm Silvermont processors already, would be shipping 14nm processors by year-end and had a clear path to 10 nm and 7nm processes targeted for 2015 and 2017, respectively. These are dramatic advances compared to the 90 nm process of 2003, for example. With each iteration, chip costs go down, power goes up and device reliability improves. Couple that with Intel's revolutionary voltage control on the chip, and power consumption goes down (read: battery life increases).Intel is targeting smart devices with Silvermont, a market where it has had little representation until now. That seems certain to change, with over 100 tablets and a handful of smart phones today sporting the ""Intel Inside"" logo. Sales of these units will be important to Intel's lagging ""Other Intel Architecture"" segment, which in 2012 had revenues of only $4.4 billion and showed an operating loss of $1.3 billion. I believe Intel has a shot at substantial improvement in 2014 with revenues as high as $7 or $8 billion (based on the addition of 80 to 100 million devices with Intel Inside at $40 content per device), which should be enough to bring the segment to a profit rather than a loss.The decline in the personal computer business has been challenging for Intel, which in 2012 had revenues of $34.3 billion in this segment, a 3% decline from 2011.In 2013, this decline is continuing. Intel is combating the decline with its Haswell and Silvermont processors aimed at PCs from desktop to ultra book to 2 in 1 devices and has augmented the processor advances with its innovative vPro Technology specifications for business computers than include solid state hard drives; wireless display; no password log on to virtual private networks (VPNs) and indoor location based services. Intel announced at IDF 70 devices meeting this specification that should hit the market in early 2014."
Sonus And AudioCodes: Your 1-2 Punch For Potential Takeovers,Jun. 5.13,"Last week, the session border controller (SBC) pure play Sonus Networks (SONS) met with Jefferies & Co. The analyst subsequently upgraded the shares to outperform sending Sonus' shares up over 30% in 3 days of trading. Also, last week, AudioCodes (NASDAQ:AUDC) announced that it released a new SBC with increased sessions to broaden its offering from 800 sessions to 10,000 sessions in 2013 and to greater than 10,000 sessions in 2014, a significant revenue driver for it. In addition, AudioCodes released its new software for cloud and hosted environments which services the Carrier space something it has never done before. This now makes it a direct competitor to Sonus, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) (via Acme Packet acquisition) in the Carrier space. The SBC enterprise market is estimated to be worth $1 billion by 2016 while the SBC carrier market is estimated to be $1 billion plus. Recently, Oracle cleverly swooped in to acquire Acme Packet at 6.5 times sales and now Sonus and AudioCodes are positioned to be taken out next.Here are the reasons to own Sonus and AudioCodes at what I believe are deep discounts to their intrinsic value:Sonus Networks:· Empire Capital management, a technology driven hedge fund, has acquired 15% of the shares over the past 12 months. When funds go over 10% it is a sign of confidence and indicates that a tremendous amount of homework has been assigned to the investment.· Fidelity Management has now increased its investment in Sonus over the past two quarters from about 1 million shares to over 9 million shares. Speculation is that it will increase its position to 20 - 27 million shares.· Sonus is referred to as the pure play of the publicly traded companies in the SBC market.· Sonus acquired Network Equipment Technologies (NET) (a weaker competitor of AudioCodes) in 2012 in order to participate in the enterprise SBC and unified communications (UC) markets helping it grow its total available market (TAM).· 2014 Revenues (estimate): $300 million. Revenues will see 11% growth over 2013."
Callidus Software: Getting All Dressed Up For The Acquisition Ball,Dec.23.13,"Will Callidus Software be the next prominent cloud-based vendor to get acquired? If so, the Board of Directors is not standing in the way. Recent moves to crush the firm's poison pill, reorganize the C-suite, and place emphasis on profit indicate a speeding up of the process. Our acquisition-based probability model estimates shares are currently undervalued by >30%, with a fair value target of $16.50.BackgroundCallidus Software (NASDAQ:CALD) is a leader of cloud-based Sales Performance Management (SPM) services. SPM is an evolving category in the cloud space that is filling a gap between CRM, HCM, ERP, ECM, etc. At the core is Incentive Compensation Management (ICM) which accounts for greater than 90% of Callidus's revenue. In mid-2011, CALD issued $80.5 million of convertible notes with the intention of expanding through acquisition to create a broader suite of SPM services, including: coaching and learning, configure-price-quote (CPQ), marketing automation, gamification, territory-quota management, and the newly announced Thunderbridge, a big sales data analytics solution. Gartner recognized Callidus's well-rounded portfolio as the visionary leader in its inaugural 2013 SPM Magic Quadrant, ahead of major players: IBM (NYSE:IBM), Synygy, salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (left out of the 2013 MQ). Management cites Gartner's global estimate of a total addressable market for SPM greater than $10 billion, suggesting CALD's share is 1% with ~$100 million in revenue. This may also suggest the SPM market has been slow to adopt SaaS solutions and the majority of customers stuck in legacy on-premise products from SAP and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) may soon be ripe for the picking.Investment SummaryCallidus Software is an attractive target. The customer base consists of large, stable companies diversified among primary industries: Insurance, Telco, Pharma, Financials, and Hi-Tech. Since the end of '09 the base has grown ten-fold from 230 customers to ~2300 today including: All-State, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Bank of America, and even competitor SAP. Most contracts signed range 12-24 months with more recent and large seven to eight-figure contracts reaching the max length of 5 years. This trend of relatively large contract wins at a longer duration may be viewed as enterprise customers realizing CALD's value and looking to lock in currently low ASPs. Backlog stands around $130 million with strong visibility of ~75% and management consistently cites >90% retention. CALD's win rate is approaching 70% and is expected to rise alongside a growing sales team that previously could not meet inbound demand. Q3 ended with sales headcount at ~65, up from ~50 in Q2, and management believes more sales heads coupled with an increase in resale partners is a main catalyst to future growth. The partner channel is emerging rapidly with over 25 resellers quadrupling y/y deals in Q3 and includes big names: Accenture, Deloitte, PWC, NetSuite, Oracle, and Salesforce."
Cisco: What Happened And What's Next,Nov.22.13,"Wall Street was shocked when Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) provided cautious guidance on its 1Q14 earnings call on November 13th for its upcoming 2Q14 quarter. The shocking guidance of sales declining between 8-10% year over year led to a decline of 11% on the stock the following day. While the investment community was well prepared for a challenging quarter given expectations of weak US government and China spending, the guidance was much worse than expected.It was fair for Wall Street to be surprised by the guidance, as Cisco has never shown a year over year decline in sales on the order of 10% except during periods of economic recession. Since Cisco has significant market share in major categories within Enterprise Networking IT spending (e.g. switching, routing, WiFi, collaboration etc.), it is difficult for the company to grow during periods of economic contraction. Specifically, Cisco witnessed year over year sales decline ranging from 8% to 18% during the four quarters of the 2009 financial crisis recession and more significant declines of close to 30% year over year during the collapse of the technology bubble in 2001 given this downturn was more pronounced in the technology sector.While GDP growth is not strong in the US and the world overall, the US and the world are not currently in a recession nor do economists generally expect the US and the global economy to enter a recession in the very short term. In fact US GDP growth has been improving with growth of 1.1%, 2.1% and 2.8% in 1Q, 2Q and 3Q of 2013, yet Cisco showed a declining trend in North America year over year order rate in the past three quarters at 7.0%, 5.0% and -2.0%. Cisco's weak order growth was not limited to North America as EMEA and Asia Pacific declined 4% and 10%, respectively, with an overall company decline of 4%. The declining order trends for Cisco in all regions of the world, and the US in particular is troubling.Cisco's weak order growth and guidance is likely due to the following main points:"
Uni-Pixel: Is The SEC Investigating?,Jun.21.13,"When we consulted with experts in the touch screen industry who had tested UniBoss, it was clear to us that Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) was unlikely to be successful. You can find a summary of our findings in our first article. But the best shorts don't just have bad technology - they also have bad characters. So as we did our checks, we also researched the past histories of the management team. The information we uncovered was overwhelmingly negative.Three current and former Uni-Pixel executives have been involved in past scandals at their companies where there have been allegations of fraud. In the lawsuits described below, the similarities are striking. The lawsuits claim that executives raised money from investors despite knowing that their technologies and products did not work and were going to fail. We believe that Uni-Pixel executives are at it again, but this time we suspect the SEC is catching up to them.SEC letters and FOIA responseWe have witnessed what we and others believe to be multiple examples of securities violations by the executives at Uni-Pixel. As a result, we wrote the SEC on three separate occasions about our concerns regarding Uni-Pixel's behavior. On April 22, 2013, the SEC received a letter highlighting three material violations of its disclosure obligations concerning the material terms of Uni-Pixel's ""manufacturing and supply"" agreement with Eastman Kodak Company (click here). On May 2, 2013, the SEC received a letter detailing further evidence that Uni-Pixel had violated securities laws by withholding information regarding the terms of the Kodak agreement prior to its sale of shares on April 18, 2013 (click here). Lastly, on May 21, 2013, the SEC received a letter highlighting probable Regulation FD violations by Uni-Pixel with regard to selective disclosures (click here).Some investors dismiss investor complaints to the SEC based on an outdated and jaded view that the SEC only acts after a fraud is revealed, so we decided to try to determine whether the SEC was taking the allegations of securities violations seriously. To check this, we filed a request with the SEC under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to see the correspondences they have had with Uni-Pixel since the start of the year. This is what they said in their response to our FOIA request (full SEC letter here):"
Tangoe - Turning Off The Music To This Dance,Oct.30.13,"In the past, we have shared thorough investigative and forensic research on our Seeking Alpha InstaBlog about two publicly traded companies, Telestone Technologies (NASDAQ:TSTC) and AutoChina (AUTC) (here). Since our initial report on Telestone, the stock has declined by 97%, attracting intense regulatory scrutiny, while failing to file a quarterly report with the SEC in over a year. We subsequently wrote four reports on AutoChina discussing at length our belief that AutoChina was misrepresenting its financials and operating model, while potentially engaging in an offshore fraud. After an extensive investigation, the SEC sued AutoChina for securities fraud and referenced our Seeking Alpha blog, written a year earlier, in its complaint. We believe investors in Tangoe Inc (NASDAQ:TNGO) could suffer a similar fate as the investors in Telestone and AutoChina.Approximately one year ago, there were two in-depth research reports that brought a litany of concerns about Tangoe to the attention of investors (here and here). Both reports did a commendable job exposing numerous red flags in the TNGO story, ranging from a management team that bankrupted their prior company and was sued for fraud, to perpetual acquisitions aimed at obfuscating organic growth, to financial shenanigans used to hide shaky financial performance. TNGO's stock lost almost 50% of its value as the reports left little doubt about the nature of Tangoe's misrepresented business model (a BPO that was pitched as a SaaS vendor).But the stock market has a very short memory. Over the past year, the shareholder base has seemingly turned itself over and Tangoe has found a new set of investors. At the same time, the sellside has promulgated a bullish thesis that centers on promoting a low margin company with overstated revenue growth as a software-as-a-service pure play. All the while the company has latched on to the hot BYOD (bring your own device) theme with press releases and webinars for investors. A Google search of ""BYOD management"" returns results for solutions from over twenty-four companies in its first five pages, including Cisco, Aruba, IBM, HP, Fujitsu, and Citrix. Not one result was found for Tangoe. All six analysts that cover TNGO have a ""Buy"" rating on the stock, which should not be a surprise given TNGO has burned through nearly half of its cash in the last year. This predicament makes an imminent secondary offering likely. Ironically, this new bastion of shareholders may be oblivious to many of the concerns we raise in this report, despite the prominent warning signs and massive insider selling."
Cisco And Oracle Now Have A New Competitor: AudioCodes,Nov. 6.13,"AudioCodes (NASDAQ:AUDC) reported earnings last week that beat Oppenheimer analyst's street high estimates of $34.8 million (revenues) and $0.03 (NYSEARCA:EPS) with $35 million and $0.04 respectively. It guided revenues higher to $36 million on stronger backlog numbers in its core networking businesses. I not only listened to the AudioCodes conference call, but listened in on Interactive Intelligence Group's (NASDAQ:ININ) conference call and BroadSoft Corp's (BSFT) conference call and the takeaway from both companies with regards to AudioCodes is that AudioCodes has built a brilliant strategy as I see it benefiting from its partnerships with the hosted companies in the same way as it benefited from partnering with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) with its One Voice for Lync. AudioCodes is selling itself to the hosted companies as an alternative to the tech giants Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), in the same way as it sold itself to Microsoft with great success as a Cisco/Oracle replacement. I believe that in early 2014 as further hosting company partnerships are announced we will see it being loved by Wall Street's sell-side and buy-side which will result in a strong stock performance.Microsoft Lync:Microsoft is doing what it does best in the Lync space, capturing Enterprises new business in the unified communications (UC) space. In Q3, 2013 AudioCodes grew its Lync business by 10% quarter over quarter and its growing by 25% year over year. More importantly, the backlog and new programs lined up during late Q3 and early Q4 will make 2014 a much stronger year than 2013.AudioCodes' initial strategy with Microsoft was to position itself as an alternative to Cisco Systems, Acme Packet (which was later acquired by Oracle) and Sonus Networks (SONS). AudioCodes put itself forward as a small company that could partner with Microsoft and provide it with the pieces it was missing in order to deliver a complete end to end Lync solution to Enterprises. Microsoft embraced AudioCodes' One Voice for Microsoft Lync and the results have been telling with ""Lync Voice leading in enterprise shipments""."
"Intel Inside Apple: Macs Now, Tablets Later",Jan. 1.14,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is not the only one profiting from the release of the new Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Mac Pro 2013. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is also a leading beneficiary - the Mac Pro 2013 has Intel inside it. The latest Mac Pro was released last December 19 and Other World Computing (OWC) immediately tore it down. The standard $2,999 Mac Pro 2013 is powered by a 3.7 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5-1620V2 with Turbo Boost that can crank it up to 3.9 GHz. It comes with 12GB of ECC DD3 Memory, 256GB PCIe-based flash storage, and dual AMD FirePro D300 GPU.The $3,999 Mac Pro version comes with a 6-Core Xeon E5 and Apple is also allowing custom order options for 8-Core or 12-Core Intel Xeon E5 processors. This powerful machine is intended for professional graphic designers, 3D artists, musicians, and video editing/compositing professionals. The creative industry is where Apple Mac Pro rules.Apple opted again to use the Xeon probably because AMD's high end processors are still years behind in terms of performance. This is not to inflame the AMD fans, I just want to let the chart on the link above speak for itself. Intel is KING of the high end x86 processor market. The Xeon E5-1620 v2 per tray price is $294. If Apple sells at least 200,000 of Mac Pro 2013, that's $58.8 million sales for Intel instead of AMD.OWC's teardown confirmed that Apple made this latest model of Mac Pro with a removable CPU so customers can upgrade the Xeon processor on their own. This is a good thing for Intel - Mac Pro users can buy faster and newer Xeon CPUs to improve their workstation's performance if they need it.Intel's income statement won't improve much from the sales of Apple's Mac Pro but a positive $5 or $50 million still benefits INTC investors. The thesis of this article is to show that Apple, the world's most valuable tech company, still relies on the engineering prowess of Intel. Consequently, Intel's very healthy income statement for the past 6 years is partly due to Apple's big switch to Intel x86 processors."
"Western Digital Corporation - Best-In-Class, Misunderstood And Undervalued?",Nov.13.13,"In my last post, I outlined at a high level an investment case for Western Digital Corporation (NYSE:WDC). I continue to believe that it remains undervalued despite a 69% rally in its share price over the last 12 months, as both the business itself and the industry in which it operates is misunderstood by investors generally. I believe a conservative estimate of the intrinsic value of the business is between $21 billion - $25 billion, compared to its present market capitalisation of approx. $16.9 billion, representing upside of between 23% - 52%. In this post, I set out a detailed fundamental business and valuation analysis for WDC, which I believe justifies my estimate of intrinsic value.1. Executive SummaryWestern Digital Corporation (""WDC"" or the ""Company"") is currently priced at approx. $71 per share in the market, giving a total equity value for the business of approx. $16.9 billion.I conservatively estimate intrinsic value for the entire Company to be in the range of $21 billion - $25 billion, or $86 - $106 per share, based on a detailed fundamental analysis of the business, its industry, management and future prospects.My investment approach for equities is to acquire fractional ownership in businesses at a price that affords me a satisfactory margin of safety to mitigate against error, imprecision, bad luck or the vicissitudes of the stock market. I therefore look to pay prices that approximate no more than two-thirds of a conservative estimate of intrinsic value for an entire business or company.On this basis, my analysis leads me to conclude that WDC is a Buy at $63 or less per share, being a 33% discount to the mid-point of my estimated range for intrinsic value, of $23 billion. I believe that buying into the business at this price level should afford me a satisfactory margin of safety.2. Investment Thesis & CatalystsDespite the significant rise in its share price over the last 12 months, WDC remains undervalued in the market versus a conservative estimate of its intrinsic value. This undervaluation is attributable to a misunderstanding of both the Company and the data storage industry by investors. Essentially, WDC has suffered from a double-fear of obsolescence:"
EMC: Analyzing The Opportunity In The All-Flash Array Market,Jan.14.14,"Everyone wants a piece of flashEMC Corporation's (EMC) newly launched all-flash array XtremIO is gaining traction with Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, or VDI, projects. VDI hosts a desktop operating system, or OS, within a virtual server, eliminating installation of traditional OS in between. Previous VDI projects often failed because they were attempting to replicate pilot test results in actual production, but this is possible using XtremIO. Around 70% of the XtremIO deals involve VDI projects, and it will open up new opportunities for XtremIO.The demand of flash array storage is growing fast since traditional hard disk drives have failed to live up to the expectations of Big Data and Cloud storage. As a result, companies are now more inclined to use flash array in their data centers. The flash array market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 58.5% and reach $1.2 billion by 2015. Looking at this opportunity, different storage companies like NetApp (NTAP), Pure Storage, and Nimbus Data have decided to launch storage systems using flash technology. However, competition is not something new to EMC; it has competed with its peers successfully in the past. The competition is getting intense, as just a few days after EMC launched XtremIO, NetApp's also launched its new all-flash array storage system, EF550, along with its storage array E2700 and updated E5500 array. Through these launches, NetApp aims to target a wider audience with its E-series portfolio for those that want high speed from a flash solution.(Source: Permabit)Although, none of these companies have achieved a supreme position in flash array and each one has a competitive edge over the other in one way or another.XtremIO's advantage is its deduplication feature of ""always on,"" while NetApp allows customers the option to turn off deduplication since it affects the performance. However, the XtremIO array performance isn't impacted by deduplication, and it stores all the data in the DRAM. In comparison EMC, Nimbus uses significantly less DRAM, thus making it more cost effective, while supporting deduplication. Nimbus data boasts of its lower power consumption; it is ten times more power efficient than EMC's XtremIO."
EMC Corporation: Big Data And Cloud Computing Are The Future,Mar.12.14,"EMC Corporation (EMC) is the world's largest provider of data storage systems. EMC offers data storage, information security, analytics, and virtualization, cloud computing, and other services that enable companies to store, manage, analyze and protect data.IT spending was lower than expected during 2013 however EMC experienced growth across all of its business segments. The increasing demand for high-end business storage including EMC VMAX, Data Domain and increasing demand for emerging business storage due to strong demand of EMC Isilon, EMC Atom and EMC VPLEX contributed towards a 4% growth in the information storage segment with revenues of $10,694 million.Since its formation in 2013 Pivotal has made good progress and generated $110 million in revenues with a growth rate of 4%. To capture increasing demand for platform-as-a-service (NASDAQ:PAAS) and accelerate its future growth prospects, Pivotal has recently launched Pivotal One comprising next-generation data fabrics, application fabrics and Cloud Foundry, a cloud-independent PaaS that is gaining momentum and becoming the standard for PaaS.The increased sales volume resulted in more revenues from VMware licenses and $2,225 million in revenues from VMware's virtual infrastructure with a growth rate of 9%.The increasing data security concerns in the digital age have increased the usage of information security systems and RSA information security segment's revenues of $453 increased by 10% for fiscal year 2013. This increase was primarily driven by growth both in identity and protection and security management and compliance businesses. Security continues to become increasingly more important in IT decisions and RSA continues to benefit from this trend with its advanced and data driven security offerings."
Uni-Pixel's Declining Production Capability And Inconsequential Purchase Orders,Jan. 3.14,"A review of past disclosures by Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) shows that the company has repeatedly misrepresented its touch sensor production capability. Since 2010, Uni-Pixel's capacity targets have been dropping from 32 to 10 to 3 to less than 1 million sqft/month, while capex requirements have been rising, and actual production and shipping deadlines have been shifting further into the future. In essence, the company, with the approval of the Board of Directors, has been operating a Techno Ponzi scheme designed to extract money from new investors and partners to pursue what appears to be world-changing technologies but without ever producing any deliverables. Consequently, the company should be worth no more than its current cash holdings plus the liquidation value of its fixed assets, or about $5 a share.An announcement of first purchase orders, such as the one in November, does not necessarily validate either Uni-Pixel's manufacturing process or its ability to commercialize its product. Despite similar announcements of initial purchase orders and shipments, the company's other overhyped products, the finger-print resistant protective cover film and the cover glass replacement film, each with hundreds of millions of dollars in potential annual sales and 50%-plus gross margin target, have failed to generate any meaningful revenues in the past five years.The specific capacity numbers may also have relevance to the SEC investigation into the company's agreements disclosed in November. While Uni-Pixel never revealed the detailed contractual terms, it claimed that it received the two $5 million ""engineering"" payments from its PC OEM partner, rumored to be Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), and from its ecosystem partner, identified as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), for the build out of a dedicated 1 million sqft/month production capacity each. However, as detailed below, the company previously claimed that it had already installed and calibrated 10 million sqft/month of capacity in July 2011. In other words, if the company were truthful about its capacity in 2011 and its agreements in 2013, then Dell and Intel were simply duped into paying for capacity that was already there."
Should You Think Twice Before Investing In Varonis?,Mar. 3.14,"Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS), developer of data management software solutions, had an extremely good initial public offering last Friday. The company saw overwhelming demand for its stock, driving the price up 100% from its initial offering of $22 to $44 at the end of the trading day, reflecting a $173M market capitalization for the company. Varonis appeals to investors as it provides a service that seems almost impossible to live without these days, and that is expected to become more important in the future: ""big data"" technology that enables enterprises to extract value from the large amount of data already stored in its servers.Click to enlarge images.The term ""big data"" was first introduced by Meta Group (now Gartner) analyst Doug Laney to define an amount of data so large and complex that it can hardly be accessed and used efficiently. Laney referred in his article to the three Vs as the catalysts for data growth: volume (amount of data), velocity (speed and frequency of data in and out), and variety (types of data). In the last few years, life has become more digitized as we use smartphones to update our Facebook status, tablets to read the newspaper, laptops to create a spreadsheet, and smart TVs to watch our favorite YouTube channel. All these examples use data generated by users and shared with other users.According to the IDC publication ""The Digital Universe In 2020,"" digital data created, replicated, and consumed in the world will grow from 130 exabytes (1 exabyte = 1 million terabytes) in 2005 to 40,000 exabytes in 2020 (as shown in the graph above on the left). Infrastructure investment will increase by 40% between 2012 and 2020 to support that (see the graph above on the right)."
There Is A Lot More To Document Security Systems Than The Facebook And LinkedIn Lawsuits,Jan.22.14,"Shares of Document Security Systems (NYSEMKT:DSS) have been hit hard since the January 14, 29014 announcement that the US District Court of Northern California issued a stay of proceedings in the Bascom Research case against Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and LinkedIn (LNKD). Bascom Research is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DSS. The stay was issued in light of Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int'l, a Supreme Court case covering the patentability of software. The slide was apparently fueled by blanket statements made in an article that followed the stay news. This gives value investors the opportunity to accumulate cheap shares while others sell due to either fear or ignorance, or both. For a more comprehensive and intelligent discussion on the stay implications, investors are encouraged to read the excellent article written by the Markman Advisors and published on January 6, 2013.All eyes will now be on the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int'l. It's anticipated that a ruling will likely be made in June. As a result, the Markman hearing for DSS is expected to be rescheduled after June 2014.Regarding the stay decision, Jeff Ronaldi, CEO of DSS stated: ""Document Security Systems, along with other owners of important software intellectual property, look forward to the results of the Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank case, which should help to clarify what subject matter is patentable under US Law.""The Supreme Court is expected to issue its decision in the CLS Bank case by June 2014, which means that any stay should only last six months, at the most. Furthermore, Facebook and LinkedIn have indicated that they only intend to invalidate one of the four asserted patents on the grounds of patent ineligibility. That means, even if the CLS Bank decision resolves in their favor, presumably only one of the patents will be affected, and the cases will nevertheless need to continue.Investors appear to forget that DSS is a lot more than lawsuits against FB and LNKD. In fact, the analyst covering the stock has assigned $1.65 to the company's core businesses, and an ultra-conservative $2.35 for potential patent wins against Facebook, LinkedIn, and real money that will result from the cases that have already been settled: Broadvision (BVSN), Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE), and Novell (NASDAQ:NOVL). Regarding the settled cases, carrying royalties ranging from 4 - 5%, the 10-Qs are still reflecting unchanged technology and licensing revenues. Licensing revenues typically come 6-9 months AFTER a deal is signed. I expect licensing revenues from settled cases to start showing up in quarterly filings."
Google Or Apple: Which Is The Better Long Term Bet?,May.16.14,"It seems that over the past several years Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) / (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continue to play the game anything you can do I can do better. Both tech giants have their own way about building and developing their own brand, but as an investor the question of which one is the better investment is something that is always a bit allusive. Below we will examine both firms' fundamentals, products, pipeline, sales growth, and overall long term potential to try and come to an answer on which is the better stock to own.AppleApple announced during its blockbuster second quarter earnings announcement that it planned to split its stock by 7:1 effective June 9th. This split at today's market price ($590) would have the ""new"" stock price start trading at $84.28 per share. This news comes just a few months after Google split its own stock in what I would consider to be a very creative ""stock split"". The firm issued class C shares in a 1:1 exchange for the existing A shares. This move effectively cut Google A shares in half or created a 2:1 split.Apple's stock split should have a net positive effect on the stock. For starters it will make the stock more attractive to retail investors simply because of the effective purchase price being cheaper. Second, it will make the stock more attractive for larger and mid-sized funds to pick up and have as a part of their portfolio. Thirdly, given that the effective price will be less I think there is a good chance that Apple could be added to Dow Jones Industrial Average index. At its new price the weighting would not dramatically affect the Dow's daily price movements on down days for Apple."
Super Micro Computer: A Founder/CEO Culture-Driven Success Story,Mar. 7.14,"Aberrations are worth exploring. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is an aberration. What else to call a company that's profited every year since its 1993 founding, and outgrown peers organically by sustained ~10% rates, despite never possessing more than 3% market share in a brutally competitive industry? Let's explore.But first, some context. SMCI smashed estimates last quarter, as sales spiked 22% y/y and 15% sequentially, a big divergence from the mid-single digit industry trend. Quarterly earnings almost doubled y/y to $0.35. The stock spiked several dollars, and analysts upgraded their estimates across the forward spectrum. Growth was geographically broad-based, but fastest in Asia, which rose to 23% of sales from 17% y/y, resulting from SMCI's commitment to grab share in the rising region, executed in recent years by building a huge new manufacturing capacity in Taiwan.Shares trade at 15x $1.40 forward 12-month earnings. The valuation bar has been set moderately, and SMCI will leap it if history guides.Alright, let's get to the meat. The purpose of this report isn't to precisely value SMCI, nor to examine its near-term outlook; it is to explain the puzzle of its fantastic sustained performance despite obvious constraints. If we understand that puzzle and identify the source of its success, then we might understand its long-run future.It's common knowledge that the PC industry is brutal. Yesterday's leaders regularly land in tomorrow's bankruptcy court. The industry is super-competitive, because incumbents lack any kind of entry barrier. There's no loyalty; I'll buy Dell today and IBM (NYSE:IBM) next time. There's little proprietary technology; computer components are IP-intensive, but boxes aren't. There are no network effects; Microsoft's operating systems enjoy the benefits of a massive base of 3rd-party software development standardized to its software, but again, the box makers don't. And the industry is enormous relative to the minimum scale at which scale benefits expire."
The Private Market Value Strategy: Part 1 - Discounted Assets,"Feb. 14, 2014 4:58 PM ET","In the past few years, my investment strategy has evolved and is now best described as being dominated by an analysis of private market value. By ""private market value,"" I mean the value that a potential buyer would assign to an entire company. It can manifest itself in takeovers, LBOs, and transactions completely outside of public markets in which a privately held company is purchased.This approach essentially ignores technical analysis and does not attempt to determine whether the ""market"" is over- or under-priced (although, inevitably, more stocks will be attractive on a private market value basis in a down market). If you follow this approach, you will not necessarily be in tune with trends. On the other hand, an investor following this approach will discover that he or she often owns stocks that are also owned by certain notable value investors (e.g., Carl Icahn) and that ""activist investors"" often arise and try to get management to ""unlock"" the inherent value of the company through various restructuring plans. You also will tend to find many of the companies in your portfolio engaged in share repurchases - reflecting management's conviction that the stock is a bargain. Another phenomenon will likely be the discovery that a number of your holdings are subject to takeover or leveraged buyout activity. You will have to be patient because the price may take a long time to catch up to the value, but, in the long run, the strategy should work very well.The problem is that assessing private market value can be hard work and requires a certain amount of judgment. It involves more than simply plugging numbers into a formula and printing out the result. For that very reason, I generally like to buy at a significant discount to value.I am going to start in this article with the most straightforward situation. This is the situation in which the company is selling at a meaningful discount to the readily ascertainable value of its assets. These situations arise for a number of reasons; as noted above, they are much more prevalent at the bottom of the market and, in early 2009, looking for these opportunities was like shooting fish in a barrel. Let's first go through some basic steps in the analysis."
Can ARM Holdings Sustain Its Growth In 2014?,Jan.24.14,"The ""Internet of Things,"" or IoT, is a relatively new trend that is taking off in the connected-device market. This concept involves the manufacturing of a multi-purpose device that can have both intelligence and connectivity. IoT combines three elements: one or more environmental sensors (temperature, pressure, yaw, pitch etc.), a smart computer to process the data gathered by the sensor, and a wireless radio to connect the smart sensor to the Internet. The entire process is handled by a very low-cost chip, or microcontroller. ARM's (ARMH) power-efficient microcontroller, or MCU, designs make the company a preferred choice among manufacturers, and thus the company has gained a leading position in this market. Around 2 billion devices based on ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers were shipped in 2012, resulting in ARM's gaining 18% market share in 2012. Meanwhile, in connectivity (radios) the company gained 75% market share in 2012.IoT provides ARM an opportunity to increase its total addressable market beyond mobile device-based processors. The IoT is expected to reach 26 billion devices by 2020, from a mere 0.9 billion in 2009. This figure is far ahead of other connected devices such as smartphones, tablets and PCs, which in totality will reach 7.3 billion units in the same year.Thus, ARM is set to dominate this rapidly growing market and its popularity can be substantiated by its biggest rival, Intel (INTC), also using an ARM-based chip in the smartwatch prototype it revealed at the 2014 CES. This smartwatch is powered by an Intel system on chip, or SoC, which contains an ARM cpu inside.Diversifying its market provides ARM an opportunity to offset the potential risk of a slowdown in smartphone sales. It is also looking to establish a major presence in the server market, which is dominated by Intel with its x86 architecture. ARM is trying to leverage its power-efficient capabilities to target the lower end of the server market. Top server hardware manufacturers such as Dell and HP have already announced their server designs on ARM architecture, which will be launched in this year."
"Sphere 3D: Investors Falling For The Same Old Tricks, Fair Value Is Zero",Apr.14.14,"Following questionable characters involved in past fraudulent schemes is one of the most successful approaches to identifying compelling short-selling candidates. A background check of the insiders at Sphere 3D (TSX:ANY, SPIHF) reveals what may be a hard pill to swallow for current investors: That Sphere 3D's management is most likely misleading you. Sphere 3D is a mirage! Not only that, the management has pulled this trick at least once before. Below, we will outline its shady history and how it is repeating what it did with Biosign Technologies (TSX:BIO, OTC:BITKF) during 2010 to 2011, but with a different shell company. The companies have the same CEO, the same management team, almost the same press releases, the same partners and are telling nearly identical stories. Long investors, you have been warned: get out now.What Is Sphere 3D, and What Does It Do?Sphere 3D is a development stage software company. Its flagship product, Glassware 2.0 (yet-to-be-released), is an ultra-thin application virtualization system that will allow any device to access any software virtualized on a private cloud. Sounds amazing, right? But there is another company that does the same thing. You may have heard of it: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). And while Microsoft has decades of successful products and billions in revenues and profits, Sphere 3D could not be more different. It has been around for five years and has lost at least $5.2 million since inception, with no meaningful intellectual property or revenues to date. It begs the question: How can a company that has spent less than $200k cash on R&D, which should be the core of any emerging cloud software company, possibly have a market cap of $209 million?"
2 Problems With Hewlett-Packard's Turnaround,Feb.22.14,"Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) turnaround remains intact. On Thursday afternoon, the company reported Q4 results that beat analyst estimates and own previous guidance:· First quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.90, up 10% from the prior-year period, versus the previously provided outlook of $0.82 to $0.86 per share· First quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.74, up 17% from the prior-year period, versus the previously provided outlook of $0.60 to $0.64 per share· First quarter net revenue of $28.2 billion, down 1% from the prior-year period and flat on a constant currency basis· First quarter cash flow from operations of $3.0 billion, up 17% from the prior-year period· Returned $843 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter· Improved operating company net cash position by $1.6 billion, the eighth consecutive quarterly improvement of over $1 billionBut there are two problems with the company's turnaround: The first problem is that it is uneven, concentrated in two segments, Personal Systems and Enterprise Group. Other segments and most notably Enterprise Services and Software continued to decline:Personal Systems revenue was up 4% year over year with a 3.3% operating margin.

3 Opportunities To Grab Before The Great Market Crash Ahead,"May 23, 2014 7:32 PM ET","My economy and market cycles continue to point to mid-2014 into late 2019 as the period when endless artificial stimulus will finally fail… when the great housing market bubbles that have yet to burst finally do… when we'll see an even greater global series of market crashes… when debt will finally be allowed to deleverage… and when we'll see a 1930s-style deflation.Remember, the winter shake-out season follows the fall bubble boom, where debt exploded and all financial sectors bubbled up in value. Now, when the bubble finally bursts, almost all financial assets and the stock market will suffer.That means that asset allocation, the Holy Grail of financial advisors and the comfort blanket of set-it-and-forget-it investors, just won't work! They're dressing themselves in swim shorts and flip-flops for a trip to the Arctic.Remember the crash from late 2007 into early 2009? How did asset allocation work for you then, when almost everything in the market went down: stocks (small cap and large cap), international and emerging markets, real estate, commodities, gold and silver, corporate and high-yield bonds?Where was there to hide?The only place to ""hide"" was in the U.S. dollar and in the highest quality government bonds from Germany to the U.S.The first thing to understand is that the field of opportunities narrows greatly in the economic winter season, where deflation and deleveraging is the order of the day. So what's an investor to do during a time like this (from now into 2019)?There are three types of opportunities:Opportunity #1: Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe clearest thing to do during an economic winter season is to play it safe. Preserve any gains you made during the bubble years by selling risk assets, like stocks and real estate, commodities and gold and silver, and simply be in cash."
Intel Powers Up The 3D Printing Revolution,Jan. 8.14,"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is not satisfied in conquering the tablets market and Telematics industry. The world's largest semiconductor company also wants to lead in the 3D printing gold rush. Intel is teaming up with 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) in bringing the 3D printing technology to the household. 3D Systems is the pioneer and emerging leader of 3D printing technology.This latest development is a big positive for INTC. Judging from the one-year 135.75% price increase of DDD, the market is very much in love with the future of 3D printing. Intel is being shrewd again in riding the next big thing of the printing industry.As a quick way of propagating mainstream 3D printing, 3D Systems is bundling its Sense Software with upcoming Intel-equipped mobile computing products. Sense is a 3D scanning, 3D editing, and 3D printing software. It will be used to digitize real world objects via Intel's new embedded RealSense 3D camera. The deal also calls for 3D systems to provide its 3D scanning technology as part and parcel of Intel's Software Development Kit (NYSEARCA:SDK) so developers can further extend the uses of Intel's RealSense 3D Camera.Intel's RealSense 3D CameraAs part of its bid to dominate the tablet and mobile computing market, Intel revealed that its new RealSense 3D camera will come integrated in 2H 2014 releases of Ultrabooks, Intel-powered tablets, All-in-One computers, and 2-in-1 notebooks. NEC, Lenovo, HP, Fujitsu, Dell, Asus, Acer are all on board to deliver products this year with integrated RealSense 3D cameras. Most of which will probably run Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows 8 OS>The RealSense 3D camera offers human eye-like depth perception, allowing smart devices to see and interpret objects before it in three dimensions. This product exemplifies Intel's thrust towards Perceptual Computing. It's no longer the stuff of science fiction movies: Intel is delivering the future now. RealSense is the world's smallest embedded 3D/2D camera module with full 1080P HD sensor."
Gigamon: High-Growth Value Stock And Likely Takeover Candidate,May. 8.14,"Gigamon (NYSE:GIMO) is a network visibility, monitoring and security vendor that went public in 2013, and is still fairly undiscovered and unfamiliar to investors. It is not your typical IPO company as it has developed market leading technologies, has been profitable for several years, and is growing its top line at 25%-35% YoY.The company has grown top line in excess of 30% over the past several years, and this growth is expected to continue at 25%-35% given the company's nascent 7% penetration rate of its TAM. This future growth will come from underpenetrated enterprise markets including Fortune 1000 companies, international expansion, further penetration into the service provider market, and expansion into security offerings. The company's TAM (total addressable market) is estimated between $2 and $3 billion growing at double digits annually driven by cloud and big data, as well as the rapid transition from 1G Ethernet connections to 10G, 40G and 100G connections.Gigamon is a likely strategic M&A candidate given its technology and reasonable valuation. Among potential suitors are traditional switch and routing companies (Cisco, Brocade, and Juniper) as well as Oracle, IBM, Hewlett Packard, Dell, Riverbed, F5 Networks with Oracle, and Cisco making the most strategic sense.Oracle has made acquisitions of complementary technologies by buying session-border controller specialist Acme Packet and network optimization specialist Tekelec at premiums of 8 and 10 times their revenues, respectively. Gigamon's leading technology and products would bolster Oracle's fledgling network tools solutions and its hardware business (formerly Sun) in its effort to further diversify into enterprise network and service provider markets. Oracle needs Gigamon to solidify its data center, cloud and big data offerings as the industry transitions from 1G to 10G, 40G and 100G Ethernet connections. For Cisco, Gigamon's technology will be value adding to its switching and data center offerings. And Cisco has to cherish Gigamon's 75%-77% gross margins and targeted operating margins of 23%-28%. For both Riverbed and F5 Networks, acquisition of Gigamon would make strategic sense in terms of technology and addressable markets. For example, Riverbed acquired network performance specialist Opnet for 6 times revenues and already closely partners with Gigamon. It may also consider acquiring Gigamon to fend off the acquisition proposal by an activist investor Elliott Management."
Can Apple Dominate The PC Market Too?,May.11.14,"IntroductionIt is a well-accepted fact that the premium Mac is on the rise. With superior quality, innovation, improved value and a growing customer base, there's good reason for it to be and in the future I expect the trend to continue. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has shown that they are resisting the declining PC market while capturing market share by showing continuous growth of their PC sales. Fiscal 2014 Q1 posted a 19% year-over-year increase in Mac sales and last quarter posted a 5% increase. With Mac pulling in $5.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, it only made up about 11% of their total revenue. This is a narrow revenue stream, but the Mac is still an important core to Apple's success and for this article I will cover the commonly overlooked Mac and discuss the potential for continued growth.(Author's Note: I feel that it would make sense to state that I have continuously used Windows and my most used computer is a Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Surface Pro.)Inexpensive Macs are leading to major growthAs mentioned in Apple's conference call, for 31 out of 32 quarters, Mac showed a continuous increase in market share. Apple has lowered prices of the MacBook into very reasonable price ranges making them more attractive than ever before. In 2013, the MacBook Pro saw a price drop in February from $1700 to $1500 and then in October from $1500 to the current $1300. These decreases led Apple to a year-over-year 5% increase in units sold for the quarter. Revenue wise, there was only an increase of 1.3% due to the reductions lowering the average cost of each unit by around $44. Although this may have slightly eaten into profits, when considering the declining PC trend, any increase in market share, unit sales and revenue can still be considered a win.In addition to continued price drops, Apple has recently dropped the price of its 11 and 13-inch MacBook Air to $899 and $999 while slapping on improved processors. Not only does this put the 11-inch version at half the cost of prestigious launch version of Air in 2008, but also serves as an entry into an enormous market; annually, a $63B market according to J.P. Morgan (NYSE:JPM). This consists of the $500-$1000 range of mobile PC which in 2013 accounted for nearly 100m units making up nearly 55% of market. As a side note, this also places the Surface Pro 2 at the same price of the Air, excluding the almost mandatory keyboard covers. With an additional price drops on the Air, it is highly likely that the momentum of their improving market share will improve at a potentially increased rate."
NSN: Nokia's Largest Segment - How Much Is It Worth?,Jan. 7.14,"IntroductionWith the sale of Nokia's (NYSE:NOK) smart and mobile phone division to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nokia's largest business division is now Nokia Solutions and Networks - also known as NSN. The company/division has often been overlooked since it historically hasn't been very profitable and because it is less glamorous than the smartphone division.However, over the last year, NSN has successfully implemented a restructuring of the company, and is today, according to my estimations, Nokia's most valuable asset.The restructuring of NSNBack in late 2011, it was clear that changes were needed. As can be seen in the below diagram, the division had not made any real money over the past 8 quarters.Therefore a restructuring process was implemented with the intention of returning NSN to a healthy level of profitability. While the plan consisted of a lot of elements, the most notable changes were;A reduction of the global workforce to 17,000A new organizational structureA reduction of the numbers of suppliersDivestment of non-core businessesOver a 2 year-period, NSN expected that the restructuring would reduce operating costs by 1B Euro on an annual basis. Some may be critical of management for not fully accomplishing the target, as OPEX (so far) has just been reduced by 510M Euro, but I believe that number actually underestimates total savings related to the restructuring.According to a research report by Morgan Stanley (from 29th November), some costs have been moved from COGS to OPEX, which has resulted in a larger-than-expected increase in gross margins. This can easily be seen by looking at Nokia's financial statements as gross margin has increased from 27% (pre-restructuring) to 36% over the past twelve months."
Following The Smart Money: The Small Cap Biotech Investments Of Randal J. Kirk,"Mar. 11, 2014 8:30 AM ET","Many might not be familiar with who Randal J. Kirk is, but he is an influential man in the small cap biotech investment world. He got his start in business in the early 1980's and is now Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (NYSE:CEO) of Intrexon (XON). In 1983, Kirk founded General Injectables and Vaccines (GIV). GIV is a privately held company that essentially acts as a next day supplier of medical products for various outlets. In 1998, Kirk and his ownership team sold GIV to Henry Schein, Inc. for approximately $65M.Aferwards, Kirk founded New River Pharmaceuticals Inc, and took the company public in 2004. Not long after taking the company public, New River received Food and Drug Admininstration (FDA) approval for Vyvanse, an attention deficit disorder treatment, in 2007. Not long after this approval, Kirk sold the company and his 50% stake to Shire plc for $2.6B.In 1999, Kirk turned his attention to venture capitalism, and founded Third Security, LLC, which invests in start-up developmental biotech companies. It's through Third Security LLC that Kirk currently invests in small cap developmental companies.One of Kirk's most successful investments over the last year has been Halozyme (HALO). In 2013, Halozyme was trading around $5, and less than a year later the stock currently trades around $14, which represents well over a 200% gain. Much of the buzz and potential with Halozyme is around its proprietary Enhaze technology.Enhaze technology consists of a recombinant enzyme called Hylenex (rHuPH20). It enables better absorption of existing drugs into the body subcutaneously."
Why The Allocation In Portfolios To The S&P 500 Is Sub-Optimal And What To Do About It,"Feb. 20, 2014 7:20 AM ET","Among my conversations with asset allocators, the anecdotal evidence suggests that the largest allocation in equity portfolios is the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY), which has become a proxy for ""the market.""However, traditional indexes such as the S&P 500 have major flaws in their construction. First, the indexes are market capitalization weighted. By the time companies become large constituents of the index, they're often past their innovative and high-growth phases, and more often than not act as a significant drag on performance.Consider the chart below. According to Ned Davis Research, ""popularity kills."" Since 1972, the S&P 500 increased nearly 5,000%. Yet, owning the top stock in the S&P 500 by market capitalization increased in value approximately 400%.Copyright 2013 Ned Davis Research, Inc. Further distribution prohibited without prior permission. All Rights Reserved. See NDR Disclaimer here. For data vendor disclaimers refer here.The stocks that have been among those carrying the highest weight in the index include AT&T (NYSE:T), Altria (NYSE:MO) (formerly Philip Morris), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), General Electric (NYSE:GE), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Most people would consider these to be ""good"" if not ""great"" companies. But, great companies do not necessarily make for great stocks.Another study (source: Daniel Solin) measured the performance of the S&P 500 from 1957-1997. During that time period, the index was up over 8,500% with dividends reinvested. However, of the 74 stocks in the index during the entire time period, only 12 stocks outperformed the index itself.In our own research, we extended a portfolio of holdings to include the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 by market capitalization. Typically, these stocks comprise approximately 20% of the index by weight. These too are household names and include Exxon, Apple, IBM, Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Microsoft, GE, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), AT&T, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). In our tests from 1983-2012, the S&P 500 increased over 2,600% while the top 10 stocks in the index rose in value just 800%."
Corning Is A Promising Investment,Feb.26.14,"Corning (NYSE:GLW) started its smartphone display journey back in 2006 when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) hired GLW to design the display for its first iPhone. Since then Corning has been the primary supplier of displays for Apple iPhones. Corning's Gorilla Glass is a very popular product for smartphone, tablet and notebook display glass protection. Corning has five operating segments: Display Technology, Optical Communication, Environmental Technologies, Specialty Materials, and Life Sciences. All of these segments have unique market positions and have contributed towards Corning's robust growth.Corning's net sales of $7,819 million slightly declined by 2% compared to $8,012 million. The change in the net sales was primarily driven by an increase in the Optical Communication segment's carrier products largely due to growth in North America, China, and Europe. However, optical fiber sales remained low offsetting the above mentioned increase. Another contributor to the sales increase is the impact of the acquisition of the Discovery Labware business. Display Technology contributed 32% towards sales also declined for the year. The sales were hit due to demand for Corning Gorilla Glass falling by 17%. The Environmental Technology segment's demand also fell due to lower demand for light duty and heavy duty diesel products.The following graph shows revenue percentage by segment.Source: Financial StatementsDespite the fall in revenue, the positive aspect of Corning's financial performance is that its net income improved to $2 billion or $1.34 per share compared to the net income of $1.6 billion or $1.09 per share for 2012. The improvement in earnings was caused by a decrease of $45 million in restructuring and impairment charges and overall effective cost control by the company. Corning's Optical Communications, Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments contributed towards increased net income."
Intel's Economic Moat,Mar.15.14,"Intel's Economic MoatIt is hard to think of a firm that has a more compelling economic moat than Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).The source of this moat is straight-forward: There is literally no firm on the face of the earth that has Intel's technical capability in mass producing digital logic chips-the electronic brains that power laptops, desktops, and servers. Despite similar financial resources, Intel's largest manufacturing competitors Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Global Foundries, and TSMC (NYSE:TSM) are still consistently one generation behind its production capabilities thanks to its manufacturing prowess. In an industry that, in a very real sense, has reinvented itself once every 18 months for the last half century, Intel has had a largely uncontested first mover advantage twice every three years.INTC data by YChartsValuation Drivers: RevenuesIt is a testament to the strength of Intel's microprocessor franchise that it has been able to maintain the revenue growth it has throughout the demand shift toward mobile devices. It has emerging market demand for PCs and demand for cheap, general-purpose servers to thank for that revenue growth. It is interesting to note that Intel's processors were originally considered data center also-rans. That is, until someone realized relatively cheap Intel x86 ""boxes"" could be chained together to approximate the power and performance of specialty chips manufactured by IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) Sun segment. In a twist of Tech Karma, companies selling processors based on designs by ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) may now be trying to eat into Intel's server share in the way Intel originally ate into Sun's and Big Blue's."
BlackBerry: The Enterprise Mobility Leader,May.13.14,"BES: A Platform Built for the Mobile EnterpriseBlackBerry's (BBRY) role in pioneering enterprise mobility is well-documented. Unlike many recent articles published, my intent is not to rehash the past but, rather, to analyze and discuss BlackBerry's continued role as the mobile enterprise leader, which is the foundation for its future and the sole reason I invested in the company, despite its recent disastrous foray into consumer land.BlackBerry is well-positioned to continue leading in enterprise mobility. I have been following - and competing against - the company for nearly 15 years and am amazed that none of the big enterprise software companies has been able to come close to displacing it. This is due in part to the sheer size of the companies, as most are behemoths having swallowed their competitors over the past 10+ years, which makes it really hard to be nimble and responsive to leaps in technology. But it's also due to their world being desktop-centric (with a legacy client-server architecture and god knows how many millions of lines of code), whereas BlackBerry was built for mobile from the ground up. This might not sound like a big deal, but it is, especially when it comes to performance, flexibility, scalability and maintenance. Here's a simple view of BlackBerry's architecture:"
Tracking Small-Cap Super Investor MSD Capital - Q2 Update,"Aug. 24, 2014 3:45 PM ET","Investors can benefit from tracking the portfolio of not only large and mid-cap super investors, but also small-cap super investors such as MSD Capital. The firm helps Michael Dell diversify his wealth away from his large equity ownership in Dell Computers. While the firm manages somewhere around $12 billion and holds many other alternative assets, the long-only portfolio is extremely concentrated to a few small-cap companies and has always been that way since the earliest filings in 2000. The high concentration should not be any surprise, since Michael Dell understands the power of putting all his eggs into one basket, Dell, and letting a few high quality companies compound the capital for you. We would think that Michael Dell and the managing partners at MSD Capital would agree with Warren Buffett's statement that:I'm a better investor because I am a businessman and a better businessman because I am an investor.A little background on Co-Managing Partners of MSD found at their website:Glen Fuhrman -Mr. Fuhrman is Co-Managing Partner of MSD and Co-Founder of the firm. Prior to forming MSD, he worked from 1988 to 1998 at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he was a Managing Director and Head of the Special Investments Group.

Why ChannelAdvisor Is Worth A Closer Look,Oct. 3.14,"Overview:ChannelAdvisor Corporation (NYSE: ECOM) is a provider of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, solutions that enables retailers and manufacturer customers to integrate, manage and optimize their merchandise sales across hundreds of online channels. Through its platform, the company enables its customers to connect with new and existing sources of demand for their products, including e-commerce marketplaces, such as eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Newegg, search engines and comparison shopping websites, such as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Microsoft's Bing (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Nextag, and emerging channels, such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN). As of December 31, 2012, the Company had over 1,900 customers worldwide. Its customers include both traditional and online retailers, such as Ann Taylor, eBags.com, J&R Electronics and Jos. A. Bank Clothiers (NASDAQ: JOSB), as well as manufacturers of consumer goods, such as Dell (Nasdaq: DELL), Dooney and Bourke, Lenovo (NASDAQ: OTCPK:OTCPK:LNVGY), Sony (NYSE: SNE) and Under Armour (NYSE: UA).(Source: Google Finance)Current AnalysisChannelAdvisor went public in May of 2013, and it has been on a wild ride since. The stock closed its first day of trading at $18.44, then traded as low as $14.25 shortly thereafter in June, then followed that up with a strong rally to $49.90 on March 6th earlier this year... the day before the huge sell-off in tech, small cap, momentum, retail, and cloud companies started. Companies in those sectors took a big hit, and ChannelAdvisor happens to be a player in each and every one of those categories. The sell-off caused a cascade of capitulation, as the stock tanked almost 70% in just over 5 months. This type of action frightens investors, but such an extreme case of selling tends to become drastically overdone, and I think ChannelAdvisor is a good example of that, as its underlying business and addressable market is booming."
Xplore Technologies: A Record Quarter Ahead And Why It Can Dominate The Rugged Tablet Market Long-Term,Dec.19.14,"IntroductionXplore Technologies (NASDAQ:XPLR) is engaged in the development, integration and the marketing of rugged tablet computer systems. XPLR's tablets are designed for commercial use and are able to withstand hazardous conditions, like extreme temperatures, driving rain, repeated vibrations or dirt and dust. Rugged tablet computer systems are continuing to become more and more important throughout various sectors and XPLR is already selling its products to the U.S. military and industry leaders in telecommunication, oil & gas, transportation and pharmaceutical. The following table depicts some key financials of XPLR.(Source: Quarterly Report - Q2FY2015)XPLR is currently a micro-cap with a valuation of $53 million and with great potential for growth. The business is financed solidly with a current ratio of 4.9, no debt and no preferred shares outstanding. Besides that, the majority of the assets on the balance sheet are current assets because XPLR is manufacturing its tablets through Wistron Corporation, their primary contract manufacturer located in Taiwan, which is a leading provider of computers and electronic components to some of the world's largest technology companies, including Dell and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ). Therefore, no investment in expensive manufacturing infrastructure is necessary and scaling production volume is not a problem."
Dick's Sporting Goods: A Strong Leveraged Buyout Target,Jun.30.14,"Shares of sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. (NYSE:DKS) are down over the past year despite an improving economy and strong stock market. DKS shares have moved lower primarily due to earnings short falls. The move lower in DKS shares has created an attractive situation for a leveraged buyout.DKS data by YChartsValuationAs shown by the chart below, DKS is trading at a reasonable valuation based on multiple metrics. Perhaps the most interesting metric to look at is DKS' EV (enterprise value) to EBITDA. Right now, DKS has an EV of just 7.74 times EBITDA. This is a function of a cheap valuation and a very strong balance sheet. Currently, DKS has just $6.8 million of debt and $139 million of cash. The lack of debt on DKS' balance sheet means that debt could be raised in order to pursue a LBO.DKS PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsDKS EV to EBITDA ((NYSE:TTM)) data by YChartsDKS Price to CFO Per Share ((TTM)) data by YCharts"
Loews Corporation: An Underperforming Conglomerate In Search Of An Activist,Aug.28.14,"As per its most recent 10-Q filing, Loews Corporation (NYSE:L) is a holding company whose ""subsidiaries are engaged in the following lines of business: commercial property and casualty insurance [CNA Financial Corporation, a 90% owned subsidiary (NYSE:CNA)]; the operation of offshore oil and gas drilling rigs [Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., a 51% owned subsidiary (NYSE:DO)]; transportation and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids and gathering and processing of natural gas [Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, a 53% owned subsidiary (NYSE:BWP)]; and the operation of a chain of hotels (Loews Hotels Holding Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary)"". Loews also has an additional subsidiary, HighMount Exploration and Production, a natural gas E&P company, as held for sale. Unfortunately for its shareholders, Loews is also a severely underperforming conglomerate in dire need of a large activist (or activists) to shake things up and light a fire under senior management.This article examines the company's structure and subsidiaries, as well as the performance of its board of directors and senior management. The clear conclusion reached from this analysis is that Loews, in its current incarnation, simply does not make sense for investors--things need to change dramatically. In the event an activist or activists were to catalyze a break up of the company and/or the spinoff of its business lines into separate stand-alone companies, the upside potential could be significant, as these companies would re-rated by the market. Even assuming that this would not be feasible due to opposition from entrenched management and the company's handpicked board of directors, as well as potential inertia among large institutional shareholders, improvements in Loews' corporate governance could narrow--if not completely erase--the conglomerate discount, indicating a minimum upside of 20% with little downside risk. Finally, absent any breakup of the company, the market has already priced in healthy amounts of negativity with respect to Loews' subsidiaries, leaving room for appreciation in the coming years if operating performance improves. In sum, the potential gains for an activist in Loews are clear and substantial, while downside risks are limited."
Ceragon Networks: 5 Reasons Why I Keep Accumulating This Low-Priced Tech Stock,Nov.25.14,"Ceragon Networks Ltd. (NASDAQ:CRNT) shares took a big hit after its last earnings report which disappointed some investors. Just before the earnings report was released, this stock was trading for about $2.20 per share, but now it trades for about half that level at just over $1 per share. Shortly after this stock dropped, I wrote an article suggesting that the pullback was excessive and the stock was too cheap. Subsequently, the stock did rally a bit, but it has since given up those gains, presumably due to tax loss selling pressure that beaten down small caps often experience in November and December. I suggest that anyone considering this stock reads the potential upside and downside risks, which are already detailed in my last article. Based on the current valuation, it does not appear that investors are giving this company enough credit for its new IP-20 product line or for its significant market share gains in the past year. It is also worth noting that at the current valuation, Ceragon Networks could be a takeover target, especially for larger rivals who are losing market share to this company. Management may also be under increasing pressure by activists and other investors to consider a deal with the share price so low. In this article, I want to look at the seasonal tax loss pressure that could be creating an opportunity to accumulate this stock before a potential rebound into late December, as well as the longer-term potential as this company continues to take market share at a rapid pace from other competitors.I continue to believe that this stock is very undervalued and that the market will eventually re-focus on a number of positive trends that are emerging such as rising sales, reduced costs which are narrowing losses, strong potential to reach profitability in the coming year, and the fact that this company is seeing significant market share gains. Let's take a closer look into a few factors that the market appears to be ignoring for now, but which could ultimately push this stock back to a more reasonable valuation."

He has also been featured in direct marketing telecasts trying to sell early models of the GoPro cameras. He has been the first model of GoPro ads. By any measure, he has been the ideal spokesperson for his brand."
Ruckus Wireless - Taking On Ubiquiti Is A Mistake,Nov. 9.14,"I would avoid Ruckus Wireless (NYSE:RKUS) given industry developments and new product introductions. Ruckus is an industry leader in the growing carrier class Wi-Fi market, a market that is trending toward lower prices and lower margin solutions. I also believe Ruckus is making a mistake by entering the small business home office market now dominated by Ubiquiti Networks, (NASDAQ:UBNT). I doubt their traditional business model can support disruptive pricing, and I am concerned their new products' limited feature set will cheapen their brand, hurt gross margins and cannibalize their existing lower end offerings.The CompanyOn November 3, Ruckus Wireless reported revenue of $85 million and earnings of 13 cents per share for the September quarter. The Sunnyvale, CA company is just 10 years old. Prior to the announcement of Exclaim, it operated in the carrier class/enterprise class Wi-Fi market against Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Aruba (NASDAQ:ARUN); a class that does not include the small office and small home, SOHO, market. The latest wireless WLAN market report from The Dell'Oro group showed Ruckus gaining share and now in a virtual tie with Cisco as leaders in this market with Cisco at 23.7% and Ruckus at 23.6% percent of the market.The company conducts business worldwide and divides revenues into 2 product areas, enterprise and service provider. The enterprise WLANs, wireless local area networks, are large deployments of Wi-Fi for education, hospitality, arena, retail, transportation, office and warehouse environments. The service division concentrates on MSO's or cable/direct satellite television companies. Both segments are growing. Over the last two quarter Ruckus added 7,900 new enterprise customers bringing there footprint to over 44,000 customers. Thirty new MSO clients were added in last two quarters bringing total service providers to 190 worldwide."
Ruckus Wireless: A Bark Too Loud To Ignore,Oct. 3.14,"Who Are You, Ruckus Wireless?Ruckus Wireless (NYSE:RKUS) is a company that makes Wi-Fi equipment for the enterprise level. The company was founded in 2004 as a startup trying to use its intellectual property to offer value for IPTV (internet-protocol-television) providers.After some tweaking and tuning, the small startup pivoted into a Wi-Fi equipment supplier for enterprises and service providers. Peter Lynch once said that if you can't illustrate an investment idea with crayons and explain it to him in a few minutes, it wasn't worth his time for further investigation.So, this is not exactly crayons, but with the help of the Ruckus marketing department, after the following four minutes, you'll understand the investment idea. Promise.I got to know Ruckus in early 2012, before it even announced plans for an IPO. Back then, a company called ""Alvarion"" was competing in the same market as Ruckus. When I sat with the now-bankrupt Alvarion's CFO, I asked about the competition.After elaborating on the stiff competition they have, he mentioned Ruckus Wireless as a company that then had the far superior technological product in the market, better than even the giant Cisco. A few months later, and Alvarion failed to meaningfully penetrate the Wi-Fi equipment market and declared bankruptcy.Since then, I have eagerly followed Ruckus Wireless to understand who exactly this small private company is, which Alvarion couldn't even get close to competing with.Eventually, Ruckus hit a tipping point and had to go public to support its growth. Having a marketing department like that of Ruckus, which provided a stream of very vocal and fun videos about the company, is a sure recipe for a high-priced IPO.Disappointed, I made myself a note to keep an eye on RKUS and wait for a good entry point."
"Watch Out Apple, Xiaomi Is Coming To Each One Of Your Segments",Nov.17.14,"Chinese tech company Xiaomi is a rising star in the consumer electronics world, considered by many to be the next big thing out of China. In the last few years, many Chinese companies have stepped outside of mainland China and started threatening the world dominance of giant Western companies. A few examples include Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), which threatens Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the search market; Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which threatens Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the eCommerce market and PayPal (NASDAQ:EBAY) in the electronic payments market; Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), which threatens Dell, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the PC business; and the list goes on to almost every sector.In the consumer electronics, specifically the smartphone market, many Chinese companies have tried to threaten Apple's and Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) dominance, but couldn't quite make it. Lenovo, Huawei, ZTE (OTCPK:ZTCOF) and many others offered low-cost smartphones and tablets, but could not push Apple and Samsung from their leadership positions worldwide. Can Xiaomi's effort be more successful than other Chinese attempts? Should Apple and Samsung really be concerned about Xiaomi, or is it just a local phenomenon in China?Xiaomi was founded four years ago by Chinese tech entrepreneur Lei Jun as a smartphone vendor and released its first Android-based firmware named MIUI shortly after. In August 2011, Xiaomi launched its first smartphone, the Mi1, which was nicknamed the Chinese iPhone and received more than 300,000 pre-orders, making it an immediate success for the company. The Mi1's success was driven by its attractive low price, which offered the Chinese middle class the opportunity to own a high-end product at an affordable price. Following the Mi1's success, Xiaomi used the same pricing strategy for its next-generation smartphones and managed to replicate the Mi1's success, increasing the number of phones shipped every quarter."
Update: Crossroads Sued By Quantum Corporation,Sep.30.14,"We have covered Crossroads Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CRDS) for a while now, including articles wherein we value the company at $20 per share and where we breakdown the bullish insider trading. As such, we feel it necessary to provide info surrounding the recent lawsuit against Crossroads.The SuitCrossroads Systems Inc. was sued recently by Quantum Corporation (NYSE:QTM) for Willful Patent Infringement. Quantum claims that Crossroads willfully infringed on United States Patent No. 6,766,412 (short-hand referred to as the '412 patent) filed by Quantum in July of 2004. They accuse StrongBox, Crossroads' main product, as having incorporated this technology.The PatentThe '412 patent deals with ""Data Storage Media Library with Scalable Throughput Rate for Data Routing and Protocol Conversion"", according to the filing. Essentially, what the patent claims is a digital storage unit that comprises of:A multiplicity of storage media slots with each storage slot specified for receiving a media unitA plurality of storage media units loaded in each of storage media slotsA plurality of data transfer devices embedded within each of the storage media unitsA plurality of interfacing devices for connecting the embedded system of multiple data transfer devices within multiple storage media units within multiple storage media slots within each digital storage systemA loader mechanism for selectively transferring data intra-systemStrongBoxThe product specifically under question is the StrongBox VSeries Library Solution.

E-Bikes And Tablets: Two More Bullish Catalysts For Undervalued Battery Maker Highpower Technology,Sep. 4.14,"Highpower Technology (NASDAQ:HPJ) is riding the wave of increased rechargeable battery demand and has posted 40%+ growth for its lithium-ion product line over the last two quarters. In my most recent article on HPJ (Chinese EV Battery Market Just Another Bullish Catalyst For Highpower Technology), I neglected to mention another powerful catalyst for the company going forward: electric bikes (E-bikes).A recent report by Navigant Research forecasts strong growth in the worldwide market for E-bikes. Navigant predicts the large Chinese market was expected to reach 28 million E-bikes in 2013 - 92% of the total world market. Because of its size, Navigant excluded China from the chart below in order to more clearly show the granularity of the other markets.Navigant says the vast majority of E-bikes currently use sealed lead-acid (""SLA"") batteries. But this is changing as Li-ion batteries grow in popularity. This represents a huge opportunity for HPJ. The company can use its new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility to ramp up Li-ion battery sales and expand its E-bike battery market share."
How Big Is EX4600 For Juniper?,Sep.11.14,"Juniper's (NYSE:JNPR) range of Ethernet switches recently welcomed the EX4600 to the family. The switches have been built on the open converged framework of the company and are more flexible. They offer more connectivity solutions in order to support campus environments where the concept of ""Bringing Your Own Devices,"" BYOD, is more common. Before the announcement of this new switch to the portfolio, the company had announced the release of the EX9200 switch in 2013. This indicates that the company has been spending a lot of time in expanding its portfolio of switches.Mike Marcelline, the senior vice president of strategy and marketing at Juniper discussed the support for the new EX4600 switches,""As more and more personal devices are being brought into the campus and enterprises continue to deploy cloud-based business applications, great demands are being put on the campus network to not only support varying devices but also ensure uninterrupted data access to cloud services. To meet these evolving requirements, Juniper has built its new EX4600 switches on the design principles of our new Open Converged Framework for the cloud-enabled campus - an open architecture that embraces third party solutions, provides a virtualized and programmable platform to enable network function convergence with a plug-and-play design that seamlessly scales as campus cloud requirements demand.""Juniper's switching business has been doing remarkably well over the past couple of years and last year its sales grew at a 15% year-on-year growth rate. This growth rate followed into the current year as well and sales in the first quarter grew by a staggering 46%. The year-on-year growth rate reported for the second quarter was 25%. Demand for next generation data center transformations and cloud building projects have spurred the demand for switching technology."
Get Paid While You Sleep: REITs That Pay Monthly,"Sep. 17, 2014 7:00 AM ET","Over a month ago, I wrote an article compiling a list of REITs that pay monthly dividends. As I have witnessed here on Seeking Alpha, the monthly paying companies have proven to be a most popular theme.It's not hard to see the attraction to a monthly dividend, particularly if you are retired and living off your investments. Your expenses - including everything from house and car payments to your cable bill and cell phone bill - are almost always on a monthly cycle, whereas most income-producing investments pay quarterly or semi-annually.So the advantages of a monthly dividend payment is 1) it makes bill paying easy, 2) it reduces the volatility of the shares when going ""ex-dividend"", because the companies that pay frequently usually communicate more often (than the quarterly payers), and so if the monthly payer increases, reduces, or suspends the dividend, the shareholder can respond faster to the good or bad news, and 3) you just make more money. If you don't rely on the monthly income, you take can take advantage of the power of compounding.The wonder of compounding transforms your investable money into a highly powerful income-generating tool. Compounding is simply the process of generating earnings on an asset's reinvested earnings. To work, it requires two things: the reinvestment of dividends and time. The more time you give your investments, the more you are able to accelerate the income potential of your original investment.By using compounding, your portfolio amplifies the growth of your working money and maximizes the earning potential of your investments - but remember, because time and reinvesting make compounding work, you must keep your hands off the principal and dividends. Marc Litchenfeld, author of Get Rich with Dividends, explains:"
Coca Cola: A Company That Is Facing Mixed Future Expectations.,Sep.29.14,"The world's leading soft drink company, Coca Cola (NYSE:KO), has a long history of outstanding performance. However, closer to the present, Coke's revenue growth has considerably decreased due to lower sales of its soft drinks. This resulted in a small gain of 8.7% by Coke's stock during last 12 months, significantly underperforming the S&P which had a 22.5% gain over the same period. The analysis offers both opportunities and risks for the company's future.A Boost In MarketingRecently the management had acknowledged the company's current state and the need for action to improve growth. First of all, Coke announced that it will spend $1 billion on extra marketing efforts by 2016. The impact is already evident. The company's ""Share A Coke"" campaign has considerably helped to boost sales, managing to increase worldwide volume growth by 3% in the latest quarter. The company still had a decline in revenue of 2.6% for the first six months of 2014; however, the gross margin actually showed improvement by 0.6%. The increasing spending on marketing will help Coke to achieve higher growth and revenue levels.Demand For Still Beverages IncreasesThe company was able to sustain an acceptable level of revenue mostly due to its still beverages. In the first quarter of 2014, Coca-Cola's sparkling beverage volume was able to increase by 6% globally. This result is more than three times greater than the company's overall volume growth rate for 2013, and six times better than the sparkling beverage volume growth in 2013. The success in still beverages is driven by two factors; the brand investment and the increasing popularity of soda alternatives in the developing countries. For example, the company has greatly benefited from investments in Dell Valle and Maaza juice brands, in countries such as Latin America and Asia."
"Neonode: Strong Sell On Shell Games, Fraud Litigation And Hyping Obsolete Technology",Jun.18.14,"Neonode (NASDAQ:NEON) is a reverse merger that traded for $0.50 per share on the OTC market just a few years ago, that has gone bankrupt twice already. With promises of future revenue, 160 promotional press releases and questionable ties to an alleged paid stock promotion scandal, NEON now trades at an eye-popping ""bubble valuation"" of $153m, despite just $4.3m of trailing 12-month revenue, which is a -31% decline from 2011 revenue.Most importantly, Swedish court documents show NEON executive Chairman faces fraud allegations from profiting off of the sale of a shell company that went bankrupt and wiped the investors out. This, along with the multiple bankruptcies of Neonode in the past paints an interesting pattern to me.NEON has consistent cash burn, and has only survived thus far due to consistently issuing dilutive equity to fund cash needs. Primary industry research shows current contracts are not generating material revenue, while NEON's fundamentals are rapidly deteriorating due to obsolete and commoditized ""technology"". I expect as NEON's story continues to come unwound, NEON will need to continue issuing an increasingly large number of shares, diluting shareholders in an accelerating manner, to fund its cash burn."
"Citrix Killer: Sphere 3D's Debut On Nasdaq, Merger With Overland, Purchase Of V3 Systems",Jul.21.14,"Sphere 3D Corp.'s (NASDAQ:ANY) debut on the NASDAQ Global Market this week heralds the arrival of a new and powerful competitor to the Information Storage and Virtualization sectors - two of the fastest growing segments of the world economy.The incumbents in the space are Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS) with a $10 billion market cap, EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) with a $54 billion market cap, VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW) with a $41 billion market cap, and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) with a $367 billion market cap.The reason why I think Sphere 3D is a serious contender is as a result of several acquisitions the company has made in the last year, combining Sphere's Glassware 2.0 virtualization platform - by all accounts, a revolutionary approach to virtualization - with V3 Systems' Virtual Desktop products and Overland Storage's global data management and storage business.The target is the $100 billion Virtualization/Storage space, and early indications suggest that Sphere 3D's Glassware 2.0 is already displacing the incumbents in enterprise-scale applications.If you look at the new corporate structure of the combined Sphere 3D Corp., it bears an uncanny resemblance to that of EMC Corp. before it floated 15% of VMware back in 2009, essentially creating two value creation machines where formerly there was one.Is Sphere 3D the nucleus of that successful model? I happen to believe it is, and here's why.Virtualization and Storage Industries: Explosive Growth AheadThere are a few great anecdotes around that capture the real scale and scope of the explosion in information and data generated by business worldwide. Now saddled with the simplistic yet succinct ""Big Data"" tag, that label already appears understated."
Autodesk: New Business Model On Track To Be A Success,Oct. 8.14,"We have long been positive on Autodesk's (NASDAQ:ADSK) business model transition from licenses to cloud and subscriptions, pointing out that revenue streams would become more recurring and predictable, that new paying users would join thanks to lower upfront costs and that piracy would be reduced through the use of cloud-based authentication. In all, a subscription-based model is likely to deliver higher revenues, margins and cash flows in the long run.The new business model was in focus during Autodesk's Investor Day last week and sparked many sell-side upgrades as Autodesk provided strong metrics giving increased confidence in the transition and in the group's ability to achieve and potentially exceed its long-term guidance. As a reminder, Autodesk expects 12% billings CAGR through FY18 and a 30% operating margin in FY18 (from 15-16% in FY15).Autodesk speeds up the transition: 100% recurring revenues in sightAs commented in our previous articles, the model transition has been performing ahead of expectations in Q1 and Q2, leading Autodesk to raise its FY15 net adds target to 200-250K from 150-200K when reporting its Q2 figures. Interestingly, the company said that 30-35% of subscribers were net new customers, confirming that the ""lower cost"" (see the impact on ARPU below) model was attracting new users.It looks like the transition will now go even faster as Autodesk announced plans to phase out perpetual licenses over the next 12-24 months, starting with AutoCAD LT. Of the company's 2.9m customers that are not on a subscription plan, half of them are AutoCAD LT users and will have to migrate soon."
Ixia: Too Many Questions And Concerns For Investors,Jul.29.14,"I am downgrading shares of Ixia Corporation (NASDAQ:XXIA) to a Sell recommendation from ""speculative buy"" with a $7.50 price target. Due to the lack of clarity regarding the company's financial statements and continued management missteps I cannot suggest the shares at this time. Further, if Ixia's financial reporting trepidations remain, it may result in an eventual delisting from the Nasdaq stock exchange. In the end, a management led buyout from founder and interim CEO Errol Ginsberg might materialize, but investors should not be too enthusiastic, as any premium likely would not justify the risk of owning the stock.Basic Value Calculation: $7.50.

"Baidu: Time To Take A Break; Initiating With $172 Target, 10% Implied Downside",Jul. 7.14,"I am initiating on Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) with an anti-consensus Sell rating based on a $172 DCF-backed target price, implying a 10% downside from Friday's close. As the stock reaches its historical high, investors are betting that China's advertising environment will remain healthy and that Baidu's recent entry into mobile payment and Internet finance will accelerate revenue growth going forward.Under my base case scenario, I expect Baidu to achieve a 20% revenue CAGR in the next five years on improving mobile ad and LBS revenue. However, investments in these areas will likely to continue to be margin dilutive due to increasing competition from Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). With the additional investment required in iQiyi and Nuomi, I do not see near-term margin rebound and forecast an average operating margin of 25% over the next five years. I feel current valuation of 35x earnings is relatively rich given the company's near-term earnings growth is likely to be stagnant and reiterate my bearish view for the stock. For investors who are looking for Internet search/mobile plays in China, I prefer Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) and Tencent (700 HK).My target price of $172 places me near the low-end of the consensus, which has a target price of $213/share, or 12% upside from Friday's close."
Google Stock Forecast: The Algorithmic Perspective,Aug. 1.14,"Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported a fantastic second quarter and Wall Street reciprocated with shares jumping in the following days. Results surged way beyond last year's second quarter report and the company successfully beat most analysts' revenue expectations. As this jump in value is certainly justified, there are still some concerns that we should not forget including Google's declining cost-per-click, and the Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) growing share of the mobile advertising market. On the other hand, Google has future prospects that should have investors excited about the company's future. From utilizing YouTube ads to pushing the innovation envelope with Google Glass, the long-term prospects are certainly interesting and if executed correctly, shareholders will be rewarded.The company's performance this past quarter was impressive on most figures including increased revenue that was up 22%, from $12.67 billion in the second quarter of 2013 to $15.96 billion in 2Q14. Google's Non-GAAP net income came in at $4.18 billion in the second quarter, beating $3.36 billion in the same quarter last year. ""Other revenues"" jumped significantly this past quarter by an impressive 53% from last year's 1.05 billion to 1.6 billion. This segment includes app download revenue, including a large array of games, which is an area of focus for Google. Figure 1 shows how Google has been able to successfully increase revenue since the first quarter of 2008."
How To Use The CAPE Ratio To Double The Return Of The S&P 500,"Aug. 2, 2014 2:39 AM ET","Introduction:The S&P 500 fell a notable 2% on Thursday and closed out Friday even lower. Is this an adjustment? The CAPE Ratio as explored by Robert Shiller would seem to indicate that the market is overvalued. Prior to Thursday the CAPE for the entire S&P 500 was around 26.50 and now it is around 25.50 (still much higher than where the safe zone is considered to be for CAPE).Should we have considered the CAPE Ratio as the early indication that the market was overvalued?I have no idea and I won't begin to pretend to know. Why? Because it is unnecessary to know the answer in order to generate strong returns. If the CAPE Ratio can be used to show us where individual pockets of deep value plays exist, then we can purchase shares that are already depressed before a market correction occurs. If one does this, then the stocks stand little chance of going much lower. I do believe that the CAPE Ratio is best used in this manner.About a year ago I started a site called caperatio.com which was devoted to the exploration of the CAPE Ratio (Cyclically Adjusted P/E Ratio) as a method to find deep value plays within the market. The site was the first to offer the user the ability to find the CAPE Ratio for an individual stock instead of simply finding the CAPE for the entire S&P 500. The usefulness of this approach was based on the assumption that there might be hidden pockets of value on an individual stock basis. These deep value plays would stand in contrast with the possibly overvalued market. By investing in deeply discounted stocks one might see greater gains then the more properly valued or possibly overvalued stocks, and since this is a relatively unused method of determining value one could capitalize on being at the forefront of a new investing approach."
How Hewlett-Packard Plans For The Future,Oct. 7.14,"Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ) deciding to split into two different ventures, HP Enterprise and HP Inc., comes as a great shock to the tech community. Long considered the biggest name in PC and printer sales, HP has been in a long decline as mobile devices, tablets, and cloud computing became the new world order for businesses and individuals. HP under former CEO Mark Hurd tried to keep up by acquiring companies like Compaq in the bet that HP's size and financial stability, in conjunction with buying smaller but similar companies, would keep costs under control and HP products competitive.Unfortunately, the acquisitions didn't prevent HP from continually losing sales, and has left current CEO Meg Whitman with the risky choice of splitting the company into two in an attempt to keep the brand name relevant. A risky move for a typically conservative businesswoman, Whitman's strategy signals the need to change course from the ""five year plan"" she had brought to the company in 2011, as well as recognition that under the current business model, HP will not be able to get back to their mid-90s heyday. By splitting the company into hardware (HP Inc) and software entities (HP Enterprises), each can do its own thing without pulling the other one down, a common issue of being too big.Why Whitman wants the EnterpriseWhitman's tenure as CEO of HP can be characterized as an attempt to be as forward thinking as possible in regard to the future of the company. She was brought on as a problem solver, and immediately went to work trying to reverse HP's fortunes. However, the expected turnaround point was supposed to come this year, but declining sales and loss of market share have stymied that. Splitting the company had to be done because the PC and printer unit, HP's bread and butter, were lagging, and the push into software and cloud computing was clearly the main focus of HP's future."
Applied Materials Drops In Liquid Crystal Display Equipment Rankings,Jul.15.14,"Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) dropped from second to third place in the LCD equipment market in 2013 while its acquisition target Tokyo Electron (TEL) dropped to fourth place. This marks the third consecutive year TEL dropped in rankings.As pointed out in recent Seeking Alpha articles on AMAT, the company dropped in ranking in the solar equipment market and lost market share in the semiconductor industry to every non-Japanese company against which it competed except for European-based ASM International (NASDAQ:ASMI). Japanese-based companies suffered from a weak Yen and since market shares are determined in U.S. dollars, on paper they lost about 20% of revenue due to Yen-Dollar conversion. We won't see a repeat of share loss in 2014 as the Yen has stabilized.The AMAT tool, sold through the company's AKT subsidiary, is the same PECVD tool sold through AMAT's solar thin film amorphous silicon failure.Table 1 shows the revenues of the top 10 LCD equipment manufacturers for the period 2012 and 2013. In 2013, equipment suppliers regained previous market position but the weak Yen impacted revenues for Japanese manufacturers. Japanese-based Nikon, ULVAC Technologies and Daifuku were exceptions. Tokyo Electron's revenues dropped by nearly a third between 2011 and 2013.Table 1Equipment Revenue of Top 10 Suppliers - 2012-2013The year 2012 was a down year for the overall LCD equipment industry, illustrated in Figure 1, but we see positive growth over the next several years based on several factors:"
Apple's iPhone Sales Are Surging While Samsung's Sales Are Sinking,Oct.21.14,"Although we do not always agree with former hedge fund manager and CNBC stock market personality Jim Cramer, we agree with his conclusion that investors should own shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and not try to ""time trading in and out of it."" Furthermore, we believe investors should carefully accumulate shares of the company. Last year, Apple had a mediocre year financially and it had to deal with Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) being the golden boy of the investment community as well as the mobile technology marketplace. This year, Apple has seen its iPhone sales rates recover as consumers seemed to have forgiven its missteps with the iPhone 5 product. Between Apple getting its growth groove back and its willingness to reward shareholders' patience with dividends and share repurchases, it is no wonder why Apple's shares generated an 85% total return since bottoming out in April 2013. Meanwhile, Samsung is seeing its revenues and profits start to sag as the iPhone continues its dominance in the high-end smartphone segment while Chinese brands cut into its low-end business.Source: Apple's Supplemental Financial Report"

They're like Doberman pinschers with a hand grenade in their mouths. - Kyle Petty - NASCAR DriverInvestors in Micron (NASDAQ:MU) have been fixated on the top line over the course of the last year, as we have followed with great interest the industry consolidation that occurred in the DRAM business with Micron's acquisition of Elpida. And quite properly, as the premise of the consolidation was that company revenues and profits would now be more buoyant given the pricing power that would come with that consolidation. That indeed has proven to be the case, and though many are impatient to see revenues rise faster than they have to date, they also are pleased by the margins the company has been able to wring out of its relatively high cost DRAM bits.More problematic for Micron is the NAND business, which constitutes roughly one-third of its bit output. This business has a margin problem, punching far beneath its weight with gross margins in the low to mid- twenty percent range. Analysts and investors have demanded a fix for this business and have been assured by the company that one is on the way. The recent UBS concall offers a good summary of the problem and the fix by Kip Bedard, Micron's VP of Investor Relations, and is well worth your time to review it. The bulk of the plan can be summarized in one acronym - TLC. More TLC (triple level cell) in more devices, offered in more channels of sale. Another important aspect of the solution is development of more and better controllers, a development that will allow Micron to offer a more diverse and differentiated set of products into more market segments. All this is good and will undoubtedly help."

Uni-Pixel's Commercialization Runs Into A Brick Wall,Apr.13.15,"A sensor with no customerUni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) intends to launch its first product, an all-in-one (AIO) touch sensor with a 23-inch diagonal sometime this quarter (February call transcript and Needham conference presentation, 9:30). This might be a problem, because the end client is apparently unaware that it would be receiving commercial shipments of such a sensor. Uni-Pixel formally engaged an AIO original equipment manufacturer (OEM) as a development customer in August last year (August call transcript). It was identified as Elo Touch Systems at the Liolios conference in September 2014 by Jeff Hawthorne, Uni-Pixel's CEO (personal communication). According to Elo's customer service, the company does not sell nor has any plans to sell a 23-inch AIO device (see current AIO offerings). The closest comparable product offered by Elo is a 22-inch AIO, with a choice of either resistive or surface-acoustic touch rather than Uni-Pixel's projected capacitive (procap) touch sensor. Uni-Pixel was asked to reconfirm that Elo is still the AIO OEM and explain the size discrepancy between the sensor and Elo's offerings, but the company did not respond.Elo, owned by a private equity firm, is one of the oldest companies in the touch industry and supplies a variety of touch solutions including touchscreen components, touchmonitors, and AIO touchcomputers, using several touch technologies and targeting digital signage, retail, point-of-sale, hospitality, medical/healthcare IT, industrial, and consumer. However, Elo's business has been in gradual decline due to competition in these mostly mature or low-volume markets. Annual revenues are now down to about $370 million from $413 million in 2011, and the company's debt carries a high risk of default."
Intel's Leadership In Notebook Processors Is Unchallenged,Jan.22.15,"In spite of its kamikaze approach to win more market share in tablet/smartphone application processors, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) continues to develop more efficient x86 processors for the laptop and PC market. I opine that laptops will remain a strong growth driver for Intel processors in this age of smartphones and tablets.It is therefore smart of Intel to continue coming out with innovative processors that will encourage consumers to continue buying new laptop models. Laptop makers like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), and Dell continues to depend on Intel to deliver evolutionary processors and chipsets that help laptops remain relevant.Intel's processors are finding more OEM buyers, which can be illustrated by the chart below made by Passmark Software. Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) inability to keep up with the engineering and manufacturing ability of Intel is painfully obvious on this chart. AMD is back to outsourcing 28nanometer processors to GlobalFoundries this year.Source: cpubenchmark.netIt's all been downhill for AMD since 2006 when it comes to x86 processors. The upcoming release of its Carrizo APU processors is unlikely to dent Intel's growth in x86 processor sales. Carrizo is another 28-nanometer design that is unlikely to steal the thunder from Intel's 14-nanometer Core M family of mobile processors."
"CSC: When All Else Fails, Split!",Jun. 1.15,"Information technology (IT) services company Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) recently announced it is splitting into two separate companies. One will “focus” on commercial markets, the other will “focus” on government contracts. Ostensibly, as we’ve heard before, leadership would like investors, employees and customers to believe this is the answer for a company that has incurred a number of high profile failed contracts, a turnover in leadership, vast losses and declining revenue.Oh boy.After years of poor performance, and an investigation by the UK parliament into a failed contract for the National Health Services, in 2012 CSC brought in a new CEO. Like most new CEOs, his first action was to announce a massive cost-cutting program. That primarily meant vast layoffs. So out the door went thousands of people in order to hopefully improve the P&L.Only a services company doesn’t have any hard assets. The CSC business requires convincing companies, or government agencies, to let them take over their data centers, or PC deployment, or help desk, or IT development, or application implementation – in other words to outsource some part (or all) of the IT work that could be done internally. Winning this work has been an effort to demonstrate you can hire better people, that are more productive, at lower cost than the potential client.So when CSC undertook a massive layoff, service levels declined. It was unavoidable. Where before CSC had 10 people doing something (or 1,000) now they have 7 (or 700). It’s not hard to imagine what happens next. Morale declines as layoffs ensue, and the overworked remaining employees feel (and perhaps really are) overworked. People leave for better jobs with higher pay and less stress. Yet, the contract requirements remain, so clients often start complaining about performance, leading to more pressure on the remaining employees. A vicious whirlpool of destruction starts, as things just keep getting worse."
Vipshop: More Indications Of Misrepresentation,May.29.15,"RecommendationMithra Forensic Research initiated coverage on Vipshop Holdings (NYSE:VIPS) with a Strong Sell rating on May 12, 2015. Since that time, a number of commentators and researchers have provided opinion, alternate views and other insights, but we have seen no evidence or additional information that refutes, contradicts or explains the myriad of serious and disturbing anomalies Mithra identified in VIPS' financial statements.In fact, we have uncovered additional information which supports our belief that VIPS is significantly manipulating and misrepresenting its accounts. We therefore reiterate our Strong Sell rating with a target price of $2.75.1.0 VIPS misrepresented revenues at Lefeng by at least $250MIn our original report published on Seeking Alpha here, we called attention to the fact that VIPS had misrepresented to equity analysts and the media the amount of revenues generated by a recently acquired company, Lefeng. We are aware of the fact that Lefeng was restructured prior to the sale, but VIPS' disclosures state that Lefeng was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ovation and that the primary changes during the restructure were movements of domains, employees and some liabilities, so we expect revenues post-restructuring to be broadly in line with those pre-restructuring."
Is The Printer/PC Unit Spin-Off By Hewlett-Packard A Bad Idea?,Feb. 4.15,"While many businesses I follow of late, including Energizer (NYSE:ENR) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), have decided 2015 is a good time to divest and spin off large ""unrelated"" business units into separate publicly traded companies, not all spin-offs are a good idea in the long run.Case in point is the decision announced October 6, 2014 by Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) to split the company in two, largely to jettison the lower-margin Printer and Personal Computer (PC) units from the higher-margin services business. I am here to argue it is a bad idea. This is coming from someone who has owned shares off and on over the last several years, when Wall Street wrote HPQ off as dead money. The fully integrated model, including the Printer and PC divisions, is a major selling point for businesses and consumers like myself. You can review my bullish HP article on Seeking Alpha from October 2013 here, when the stock price was closer to $20 a share.Thank goodness the company is keeping the steady cash flow generation from the Printer and PC units in a single entity versus rumors of selling the personal computer business only. I own mostly Hewlett-Packard products at home, and they work seamlessly together. I have a 5-year old desktop PC that works great, a 3-year old netbook, a newer Officejet Pro printer and recently bought a cheap and light Stream gadget for browsing the internet anywhere in the house. They all operate wirelessly and send print files to the Officejet Pro with no issues, beyond user errors. It's the same reason I own matching Sony (NYSE:SNE) televisions, blu-rays and DVD players throughout the house."
Sharp Drop In PC Sales Appears Ominous For Intel,Apr.13.15,"IDC reports that PC sales declined 6.7% Y/Y to 68.5 million units in Q1 2015:Following a strong second half of 2014, which benefited from the tailwind of the Windows XP refresh and pockets of price-driven consumer activity, the Q1 market faced multiple headwinds - including inventory build-up of Windows Bing based notebooks, commercial slow down following the XP refresh and constrained demand in many regions due to currency fluctuations and unfavorable economic indicators. As a result, growth and volume declined with Q1 shipments below 69 million units, the lowest recorded volume since Q1 2009.The following chart outlines worldwide PC sales:Among the top 5 PC vendors, only Dell (-6.3%) and Acer (-7%) experienced sales declines. Unit sales of other vendors outside the top 5 declined by nearly 18%; this implies that smaller vendors are finding it more difficult to compete. That said, U.S. PC sales declined only 1%. Some estimate that after the launch of Windows 10, pent up demand for the replacement of older PCs will be fulfilled and stem the decline in U.S. PC sales.Pricing Pressure Among PC VendorsAccording to Jay Chou, Senior Research Analyst, Worldwide PC Trackers, pricing pressure is causing vendors to price premium units in mid-level pricing tiers. Along those lines, Gartner estimates that mobile PCs (notebooks, convertibles, Windows tablets) grew, and expects the trend toward light notebooks with tablet functionality to continue. Meanwhile, Galen Gruman of infoworld.com is more gloomy on sales of both PCs and tablets. As indicators, he points to the stall in iPad sales and the low replacement rate of tablets in general; consumers lack the need to replace a tablet after they have already bought one. For a meaningful jump in hardware sales, Gruman believes PC vendors need to enter the phablet space:"
Ruckus Wireless Is The Market Leader,Feb. 3.15,"Ruckus Wireless (NYSE:RKUS) is a global supplier of wireless systems for the mobile Internet infrastructure market. Increased usage of mobile devices translates to more business for RKUS and its competitors Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Aruba (NASDAQ:ARUN).RKUS provides connectivity to wireless networks. Due to industry support of Wi-Fi connectivity, more and more mobile devices automatically sign on to Wi-Fi first and only go to 3G or LTE if Wi-Fi is not available. Rollout of Hotspot 2.0, which is a huge catalyst for increased Wi-Fi usage, began last year. It is technology that automatically provides secure connection of a wireless device to a Wi-Fi network even for devices without a SIM card, which includes most tablets. Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Ruckus client Boingo (NASDAQ:WIFI) have begun using HotSpot 2.0 to allow customers to move between the companies' Wi-Fi networks without having to register or log in. Just last week, Cablevision (NYSE:CVC) announced that it will be offering a wireless only service.RKUS has established a growth rate exceeding 20%, but sells at a modest forward PE of 18 and a PEG of 1.4. The company has no debt, and over $2/share in cash. Q3 revenue was a record $85 million, an increase of 23.3% year over year and within guidance of $84 million to $86 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was 69.9%, exceeding guidance of 68% to 69%. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 15.4%, the highest in company history and exceeding guidance of 11% to 13%.RKUS is at the top of its industry in sales and quality. Last year, the company overtook Cisco as the worldwide market share leader in both shipments and revenue in the category of enterprise-class and outdoor mesh Wi-Fi access points for Service Providers, according to the latest Wireless LAN Report published by Dell'Oro Group.RKUS scored as the top of the class in product quality, reliability and technical innovation in CRN's 2014 Annual Report Card for Product Innovation and Support, beating Cisco and others for the second straight year."
How Success Factors Of Businesses Change: From Polaroid To GoPro,Apr. 2.15,"Identifying a company, which looks promising today is one thing. Assessing whether this business will be successful in the future, however, is another thing.Many businesses look attractive today. Pundits, media outlets as well as other prophets of investing are not shy to praise them. Yet, are you sure that five years from now, the company will still look attractive? Stakes can change quickly in an industry, and even for people who have first-hand knowledge of an industry, it is not always easy to foresee change. In 2000, a Blockbuster Video executive laughed at the offer to buy Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) at $50 million. In 1997, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock traded at $17 a share. Back then, Michael Dell was asked what he would do with Apple. He said that he would shut the company down and give the money back to the shareholders. Industries and businesses change over time.""So that means I should only invest in companies which are protected through a wide economic moat?"" you ask. Great question, which brings us to the next and crucial point. Investors like to point out economic moats. Yet, there is a problem with economic moats. At a certain point of time, they may appear to offer long-term protection for a company. In the long run, though, even they may be subject to change. Some past moats don't sustain, and new ones emerge. Many kinds of competitive advantages have become more and more temporary over the past years, and barriers to entry have declined, as we will discuss in more detail later. Such developments lead to a constant transformation of industries, which in turn, makes predicting change even more important.Yet, predicting change is among the investor's toughest challenges. The development of a business depends on many factors, and we don't have crystal balls.While we may not be able to develop visionary powers, there are a few ways in which we can enhance our investor's tool belt and our ability to foresee change.One thing that helps us foresee change is to really deeply understand both the operations of a business, as well its customers. Why is this? When we are close to the operating business, we are able to understand which factors will have a biggest impact on its future development. We also will be able to spot early indications of change in those factors. How do we do that? Quoting gross profit figures from the annual report won't do the job. We need to dig down into the operating business. This can't be done on the go. To understand a business, we need to stop, look and listen. Feel free to read this previous post in which we have explored in more detail how to do this."
"Sphere 3D: A Short So Fat, When I Yell 'Hey Kool-Aid!' It Comes Crashing Through The Wall",Mar.26.15,"""The worse you are at thinking, the better you are at drinking""- Terry GoodkindMost companies can only dream of having their products become verbs (like Google), become so entrenched in consumers' lives and minds that their brands can define whole categories (think ""Kleenex"" or ""Band-Aid""). However, it can go too far in countries like the U.S., in which companies risk losing their ""generic trademarks"" if not properly protected. ""Zipper"" is an example of a brand formerly owned by B.F. Goodrich Company but available for anyone to use now. But what really gives product managers the sweats is when their wares are suddenly and inadvertently associated with a horrible event.In November, 1978 cult leader, community organizer, and all-around nutjob Jim Jones led a mass murder/suicide of over 900 people via cyanide poisoning mixed with flavored drink crystals. Ever since, the term ""drinking the Kool-Aid"" has been used to refer to:""a person or group holding an unquestioned belief, argument, or philosophy without critical examination. It could also refer to knowingly going along with a doomed or dangerous idea because of peer pressure.""The term is often used by short sellers to describe those on the other side of a trade.Unfortunately for Kraft Foods, the producer of Kool-Aid, society does not seem to care about the fact that it was most likely not Kool-Aid, but its cheap competitor ""Flavor-Aid"" that wiped out the poor souls at Jonestown.Given the huge run in speculative equities we've had over the past several years, especially in tech and biotech, it's not hard to find legions of Flavor-Aid sipping touts around most speculative, risky, and highly valued stocks.Sphere 3D Corp (NASDAQ: ANY) is no exception."
What To Buy In Europe: 4 Stocks For Long-Term Investors,"Apr. 9, 2015 8:22 AM ET","The Euro has plummeted over the last months and now trades at $1.08. The sharp decrease is mainly due to divergent monetary policies between the Fed (potential tightening) and the ECB (low rates and quantitative easing). As the markets expect additional quantitative easings in Europe, the currency could be poised to weaken again.According to Bank of America, the Euro could reach parity by the end of the year.Sources: Business Insider; Bank of America.Considering the recent positive European indicators and that the ECB raised its growth forecasts, the Euro could have been oversold and rally in the short-term. As a consequence, the current exchange rate could be pretty decent in order to acquire some European stocks.Picking stocks for long-term investorsAs a young investor reading B. Graham, W. Buffett or P. Fisher, I have learned to consider the stock market as a huge store where stocks have a value and a price. Both sides are fascinating as they involve business indicators, growth prospects, financial strength, research & development, corporate structure & governance but also more human related psychological factors that can drive the stock price well above or below its intrinsic value.Sometimes, share prices go bananas but some other times, they are on sale and it's a great opportunity but also a great pleasure to buy at a discount."
Did Tesla's Actions In Detroit Put Its Patents In The Public Domain? Why Investors Should Worry,Feb.15.15,"On June 12 2014, Tesla released a statement from its CEO that purported to open Tesla's patents for all to use. It derided the value of patents, and stated that Tesla had no intention to lay ""landmines"" that could serve as an impediment to other companies producing EVs and advancing the state of the art in electric transport.Despite the loftiness in the tone of the announcement, commenters (and no doubt other car companies) quickly focused on a vague limitation in the announcement that potentially eviscerated the action, or at minimum undermined the clarity of the grand gesture.The statement included an ambiguous sentence that made it impossible for a competitor or user of the patented inventions ever to conclude with confidence that they were free of a potential claim or ""landmine.""It stated:Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology. (Emphasis added)Predictably, this qualification spawned a spirited discussion on these pages and across the Internet of what had Tesla actually committed, and did it mean anything at all? What did it mean that Tesla would not ""initiate""? Did that mean that if Tesla infringed another company's intellectual property, the other company would have to agree to cross-license Tesla to all of its patents, or Tesla would retain the right to countersue on the Tesla patents?"
"Network-1 Technologies: An Undiscovered, Cash-Rich Company With A Solid Revenue Stream Could See Substantial Upside On Proven IP Assets",Mar. 2.15,"Network-1 Technologies (NYSEMKT:NTIP) is an under-the-radar microcap company whose strong merits have gone unnoticed in the eyes of institutions and mainstream investors. At $2.30 per share, NTIP is a $56M company with no debt, $21.2M in cash and cash equivalents and an ongoing revenue stream from Cisco and twelve other companies. NTIP has the potential to substantially reward shareholders as it asserts its already proven intellectual property rights.A Uniquely Strong Microcap:NTIP is a uniquely financially strong microcap company which positively differentiates it from other microcaps in the space. With over $21M in cash and no debt, the company is funded and has no need to raise cash which is a key risk with many microcap companies. The company also enjoys a $23M net operating loss carryforwards which can shield against future taxes.More interestingly, the company has been repurchasing shares at a fast clip totaling over $7.5M in shares to date. This again is very unique for a microcap company, and demonstrates management's interest to create shareholder value. These generous share repurchases also have the ability of bolstering the share price. Further, a management team whose CEO owns over 25% of the company is directly aligning his interests with his shareholders."

Countless sources of real time streaming data are used in capital markets, energy, floor shop operations and internet of things (Iot) (sensor/machine data).The Managed Analytics Platform (introduced April 2015) is an enhanced derivative of legacy software Monarch. Both products address a new important requirement of big data analysis. This overlooked prerequisite of big data or data discovery called data prep is now the new must have for enhanced data analysis. Datawatch Monarch is the original data prep software. Datawatch has been selling, developing and improving Monarch software for 20 years. Just over the last six to nine months Gartner recognized that over 80% of the time spent with big data was in data preparation. Datawatch's Monarch software was ignored for years by information research and advisory services such as Gartner. That's changed. It was long overdue. Gartner's officially recognizes data prep critical functionality. This will drive more business to Datawatch. At the end of fiscal year 2014, Gartner published a report ""Data Preparation Is Not an Afterthought.""Major data analytic vendors such as Informatica, Alteryx and smaller venture capital backed start up firms recently introduced data prep solution to feed visualization or analytic software such as Tableau (NYSE:DATA). This new category was introduced over the past six to nine months. Datawatch has a head start with access to multi-structured documents that's not being offered by the other data prep vendors.

The Aging Of The Tech Sector: The Pricing Divergence Of Young And Old Tech Companies,"Feb. 26, 2015 5:13 PM ET","As the Nasdaq approaches historic highs, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) market cap exceeds that of the Bovespa (the Brazilian equity index) and young social media companies like Snapchat have nosebleed valuations, there's talk of a tech bubble again. It is human nature to group or classify individuals or entities and assign common characteristics to the group and we tend to do the same when investing. Specifically, we categorize stocks into sectors or groups and assume that many or most stocks in each group share commonalities. Thus, we assume that utility stocks have little growth and pay large dividends and commodity and cyclical stocks have volatile earnings largely because of macroeconomic factors. With ""tech"" stocks, the common characteristics that come to mind for many investors are high growth, high risk and low cash payout. While that would have been true for the typical tech stock in the 1980s, is it still true? More specifically, what does the typical tech company look like, how is it priced and is its pricing put it in a bubble? As I hope to argue in the section below, the answers depend upon which segment of the tech sector you look at.A Short History of Tech StocksMy first foray into investing was in the early 1980s as the market started its long bull market run that lasted for almost two decades. In 1981, the technology stocks in the market were mainframe computer manufacturers led by IBM (NYSE:IBM) and a group of smaller companies lumped together as the seven dwarves (Burroughs, Univac, NCR (NYSE:NCR), Honeywell (NYSE:HON), etc.). Not only were they collectively a small proportion of the entire market, but of the list of top 10 companies, in market capitalization terms, in 1981, only one - IBM - could have been categorized as a technology stock (though GE (NYSE:GE) had a small stake in computer-related businesses then):There are two things to note in this graph.Note that 341 technology companies have been in existence for more than 35 years and an additional 427 firms have been in existence between 25 and 35 years, and they collectively comprise about 41% of the firms that had found available in the database. While being in existence more than 25 years may sound unexceptional, given that there are manufacturing and consumer product companies that have been around a century or longer, tech companies age in dog years, as the life cycles tend to be more intense and compressed. Put differently, IBM may not be as old as Coca-Cola in calendar time but it is a corporate in tech years."

4 Key Factors In Selecting Runaway Stocks,"Jan. 7, 2015 12:54 AM ET","Modern technology has made the stock market more accessible than any other time in the financial history of the world yet traders still struggle to find worthy investments to trade. Despite having access to advanced charting packages, real-time news, and instant access to a company's financial performance, finding worthy stocks to trade continues to be as much of a challenge in the 21st century as it was in the past centuries.Explanations as to why this is so difficult are as numerous as the challenges that they attempt to explain away. Like the Hydra, you chop off one head only to have another head grow back to take its place, and you're left with more unanswered questions leading to frustration and overwhelm.The focus of this article is to offer a framework to find winning stocks to trade. Rather than offer some step-by-step, ""one-size fits all"" approach, this framework will act as a guide to find stocks that stand the greatest chance of emerging as a potential leader in the stock market. It is a flexible approach that is based on what works that allows some deviation. Flexibility is important because if you get too locked in to the ""right"" way or become to rigid in your approach then you will fail to miss out on viable opportunities. Later on, I'll go into more detail about that later but, for now, understand that these 4 keys will act as a guide to help you find stocks with leadership potential in the stock market.Stock leaders are responsible for taking the overall market to higher levels but, more importantly to you, they offer the greatest overall return. They have ""runaway"" potential where they outrun the overall market and go on to rack up returns of 25%, 50%, 100%, and even greater.To help, you'll need an understanding of the two dominant schools of trading: fundamental and technical.Fundamental vs. TechnicalThere are two schools of speculation that are often at odds with one another which are fundamental and technical.The fundamental school teaches that a company's performance in its marketplace is the sole focus of determining its worth as an investment. Fundamentalists focus a great deal on all of the company's operations with a particular focus on earnings growth and cash flow but also spend countless hours deciphering everything from earnings, return on capital, accounts receivable turnover, average in-store sales, sales revenue, asset value, debt-to-income, and more."
Shanda's Buyout Price Needs To Jump To $10.25,Apr. 9.15,"On April 3, Shanda Games (NASDAQ:GAME) announced that it entered into a privatization agreement at $7.10 per ADS, which represents a 2.9% increase from the original $6.90 per ADS announced on January 27, 2014. The company expects to close the deal in the second half of 2015. We consider the $7.10 per ADS deal price to be shockingly low and extremely unfair to existing shareholders. With the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index rising 93% over the same period, a fair bump to the deal price should lead to a final deal price far exceeding $7.10.Chinese MarketWhen the deal was first announced on January 27, 2014, the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index closed at 2,033.

Hewlett-Packard In Charts: Long-Term Performance Looks Patchy,Feb.19.15,"My piece ""Hewlett-Packard - three spreadsheet tables, and the quality of cash flow"" shows the data the charts are based on. The formulas are in my 'build the spreadsheet' pieces, ""Build the big HP spreadsheet and ""Build the HP Operating Cash Flow growth spreadsheet"".Revenue and earnings, in millions:Assets, liabilities and equity, in millions:'Per share' chartsMy reason for using 'Shares calculated from EPS' is that HP (NYSE:HPQ) disclosed EPS adjusted for stock splits, but not an adjusted number of shares. I use 'Shares calculated from EPS' later to get figures for Operating cash flow per share (adjusted for stock splits). The number of shares is adjusted for the stock splits in 1995 and 1996, but not for 2000. I then used an adjustment factor for the 2000 split only, when I calculated split-adjusted values for dividend, cash flow per share, etc. (Find ""build"" for a link with the formulas.) It's complicated but the smoothly rising adjusted dividend means I probably got it right."
Intel: Wintel Alliance Might Help The Atom X3 Gain More Industry Support,May.22.15,"Digitimes' supply chain sources are reporting that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Rockchip are trying to win the support of more Chinese white-box tablet manufacturers for the new quad-core Atom X3 CR3230RK processors. Intel is reportedly offering a subsidy of around $3 per device as incentive for Chinese firms to use the Rockchip-made Atom X3 product.Intel recruited Rockchip last year to help penetrate the Chinese smartphone application processor market, which is still currently dominated by ARM-based processors. Rockchip is one of the top ARM-based mobile application vendors in China/Asia and has a network of long-term clients.Intel's shrewd partnership with Rockchip is one more reason why I believe the Atom X3 SoC could threaten Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and MediaTek's low-priced smartphone/tablet processors. White-box tablet manufacturers in Shenzhen also are likely responsible for the production of generic Android phones that get sold on a wholesale basis out of China.Generic tablets and smartphones from white-box producers in China are then rebranded and sold by vendors like Oppo, Ainol or Onda. Even India's biggest local smartphone vendor, Micromax, also has rebranded generic Android phones since 2011.Why It MattersIntel's friendliness toward local Chinese companies has long-term benefits. Top-tier companies like Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) are still ignoring the new Atom X3 products. Chinese firms can help make up for this lack of interest from tier-1 companies. According to Gartner, Chinese white-box manufacturers will continue to ship out huge numbers of phones and tablets this year, 450 smartphones and 74 million tablets."
"Cloud Computing Wars 2015 - Google, Microsoft, Docker, Sphere 3D And VMware","Mar. 2, 2015 7:50 PM ET","Cloud computing has gradually entered the second phase of the product life cycle. Naturally, several players have established strong reputations and economies of scale. Although companies with innovative technologies and superior new products can still take advantage of ample room in a fast-growing market, competition has intensified, and some early consolidations are starting to occur.VMware (NYSE:VMW) and Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS), two pioneers and early leaders of cloud computing, have gradually lost their leadership status to late-coming software and dot com giants. Recently, Amazon Web Services has become the market-share leader, especially in the public cloud domain, but the two biggest companies in the computer world - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) - are chasing closely behind and quickly narrowing the gap. These two software giants have distinct advantages over Amazon and others in the long-term battle for the cloud computing crown: they have strong roots and mass user bases in operating systems and computing hardware - two of the most fundamental elements of personal/enterprise computing.Both companies have raised their investments (in terms of capital and human resources) in cloud computing over the past year, and have made strong vows to go ""all-in"" in 2015. As a result, it is probably not an overstatement to say that 2015 is the year in which the land of cloud computing will be rattled by the troops these two giants spur into action. The result of the ensuring war will have a profound impact on the market over the very long term."
Netflix Can Utilize Product Placements To Build An Ad Business,Mar. 4.15,"Things are starting to pick up for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), especially after the recent blockbuster quarterly report. To quickly surmise my optimistic stance on Netflix, it comes down to international and domestic subscriber additions, paired with future price increases. The lack of profitability will be addressed in future years as a result of contribution margin expansion in domestic streaming and slowing cost ramp for international streaming. Netflix is slated to serve 200 geographic markets by the end of 2016, which is why the international segment is losing money. The upfront cost of licensing content, advertising and infrastructure weighs heavily on the cost structure in the initial years. Based on comments from Netflix's CFO, breakeven is attainable within a year or two after it launches the service in any geographic market. The bulk of Netflix's expansion efforts will be complete by the end of 2016, so international streaming will be profitable in the 2017-2020 timeframe.By my earlier estimates, Netflix's international segment will scale into a $15 billion/year business. Domestic streaming could plateau at around $10 billion/year, giving Netflix a $25 billion/year business in which it can scale its content efforts beyond the 20 original shows it plans to launch in FY 2015. The incremental scale will result in a tipping point in which consumers of content can rely on a small number of SVOD providers for content. I believe Netflix remains well positioned despite competition from well-capitalized competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Hulu and HBO (NYSE:TWX)."
Hewlett-Packard's Aruba Networks Acquisition Makes Sense,Mar. 3.15,"The DealHewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) announced Monday that it had agreed to acquire wireless networking solutions provider Aruba Networks (NASDAQ:ARUN) for around $2.7 billion in an all-cash deal. Including Aruba's cash and debt, the companies valued the deal at roughly $3 billion. The deal will create an industry leader in enterprise mobility by combining Aruba's leadership in wireless mobility solutions with HPQ's strength in switching.Aruba, based in Sunnyvale, California, makes Wi-Fi networking systems for shopping malls, corporate campuses, hotels and universities. Aruba's customers include: California State University and Dalian Wanda Group, which controls China's biggest property developer and largest cinema chain. The company has 1,800 employees and reported revenue of $729 million last fiscal year.HPQ has been building its networking portfolio for several years. This deal signals the company's ongoing intent to become a prominent player in the rapidly growing wireless campus networking space. In the last five years it has purchased wireless solution providers Colubris, 3Com and now Aruba Networks. Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald, said in a research report Monday.Given HPQ's bigger push into the networking market over the past few years that included the ($2.7 billion) acquisition of 3Com in 2010, we believe the planned acquisition of Aruba Networks complements HPQ's existing networking portfolio."
Absolute Software - Strong Momentum For Mobile Security,Apr.27.15,"Christian Bernad | AnalystBusiness SummaryAbsolute Software (OTCPK:ALSWF) is a provider of security and management solutions based in Vancouver, British Columbia. It specializes in remotely tracking, managing and securing mobile devices such as computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The company has recently seen a double-digit growth in sales year over year. We expect to see this momentum carry through in the coming quarters, especially with implementing the sales strategy laid out by the new CEO who has a track record of accelerating growth and increasing market share.Business DriversInformation is growing exponentially with data reported to be doubling every 18 months. Today's mobile workforce is exploding and more companies are now embracing the Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) policy. In addition, mobile devices are constantly in motion often going beyond the bounds of the corporate network. The corporate, educational, healthcare and government verticals are the business drivers for growth, as organizations in these verticals are preventing any spills of sensitive information that can lead to heavy financial losses and damaged reputation.Business RisksCompetition - The company needs to quickly adapt to new technological changes and undertake technical research and development. Substantial reliance in one geographical area - the business is focused almost solely on one economy which can offer operational and financial risks.Distribution Channels - Its sales strategy is primarily dependent upon its partnerships with its PC OEM channels to integrate its products to millions of computers. Client subscription renewal - It must maintain the annual bookings of previous customers as it makes up about 80% of sales."
"SolarCity Co-Founders Keep Dumping Stock, Should Investors Be Concerned?",Jan. 6.15,"SolarCity (SCTY) was founded in 2006 by brothers Lyndon Rive (current CEO) and Peter Rive (current CTO) under initiative of their cousin Elon Musk, chairman of the board of SCTY and CEO of Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX. SolarCity's IPO took place on December 31, 2012 at $8.00 per share.Lyndon Rive, Elon Musk and Peter Rive (from left to right) during SCTY IPO.

He bought 20,813 more shares at $11.12 during the following days.October 21, 2013 Musk made his last disclosed trade in SCTY stock, purchasing 214,869 shares at an average price of $46.54, for a total cost of $10M. On that very same day, CEO Lyndon Rive acquired 107,434 shares at the same average price, for a total buy of $5M. It was his first and only purchase of SCTY stock.Insider Trading BeginsIn fact, except for the symbolic purchase of 6,000 shares by new CFO Brad Buss, those were the last meaningful insider purchases to date. On the contrary, CEO Lyndon Rive started selling stock in April 2014 and since August has been dumping stock at a rate of 100,000 shares per month (30,000 of which are option exercises). Similarly, his brother and CTO Peter Rive sold 135,000 shares in July 2014 (30,200 of which were option exercises) and has continued selling 125,000 shares on a monthly basis ever since (37,500 of which are option exercises every month)."
"Intel, Verizon, Dell And The Connected Cow",Oct.31.15,"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been working on developing IP and products for the IoT (Internet of Things) for many years with the idea that they do not want to miss this next huge growth area which companies like DHL and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) have estimated to be 50 billion things by 2020. These companies estimate that IoT will deliver a $1.9 trillion boost to supply chain and logistics operations. While Intel will sell chips to go into Things, their biggest financial benefit will come from sales of processors for gateway devices to collect data at the edge and data centers needed to store/process/analyze the data from 50 billion Things so that personal computing devices can connect humans to the useful Big Data analytics. (Note that the chips in Things, onsite gateways and onsite processor chips are part of the Intel IoTG while the processors in data centers are part of the Intel DCG.)Flexible Data Plans for IoTOne of the factors holding IoT back has been the cost of connecting limited use devices to the Internet. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has recognized this and recently announced programs to connect cars at a lower cost (Hum) and to provide a variety of data connection plans for various types of devices and usage (ThingSpace). ThingSpace will encourage more IoT devices by providing flexible data plans for Things that are connected to the Internet. This will likely lead to other Internet service providers offering similar packages and ultimately grow the IoT business."
What Should You Do With EMC Debt?,Oct.14.15,"This article discusses EMC's (EMC) and Dell's pending merger, future debt and outstanding bonds. EMC has three outstanding bonds that are A rated by S&P. The bonds have dropped in value with the pending merger.According to an article in Fortune, the total deal will be about $67 billion. Eight banks will lend $49 billion and $17 billion will be raised in the debt (high-yield) markets. After the dust clears, the combined companies will have $56 billion in debt. EBITDA for EMC was $6.3 billion and Dell, which has been private since 2013, last reported $4.5 billion two years ago. The combined offer is cash and debt and will take out EMC at $33.15 a share. The Wall Street Journal estimates the two will have combined revenues of $104.4 billion and be the third-largest privately held company in the U.S. The 8-K filing with the SEC shows additional information.Three issues by EMC have dropped considerably in price. As all were A rated by S&P, they had low yields before the announcement. The first bond matures 6/1/18, yields 3.816%, and has a cusip of 268648ap7. The second bond matures 6/1/20, yields 5.252%, and has a cusip of 268648aq5. The third bond matures 6/1/23, yields 5.732%, and has a cusip of 268648an2. These are the only bonds my screener pulled up. Dell has no bonds publicly traded.As you can see, the bond market does not like the concept of a merger. Companies with publicly-traded bonds must make SEC filings, even if they have no publicly-traded stock. The three bonds mentioned are under review by S&P and Moody's.So what should an investor do if they own these bonds? If you are a tech person and believe in this merger, hold onto them. If you are not a tech person and are a lover of financial statements, you may want to sell. Personally, I'm not a tech person. Usually the life of a tech company goes something like this: product innovation, rapid growth, stabilization and then decline. Some tech companies have no debt and are able to go on for years hoping for a new product. As long as Dell has the best computers and EMC the best cloud network, the two will be okay. But with this amount of debt, the combined entity doesn't have much wiggle room for down years."
Charge Up Your Portfolio With 14% Yields From Kemet Corporation's May 2018 Bonds,Nov.16.15,"This week, we revisit the world's largest manufacturer of tantalum capacitors, and a market leader in the development and manufacture of capacitors. Kemet Corporation (NYSE:KEM) has spent the past few years restructuring with the goal of creating a company with efficient, cost-effective production that is also on the leading edge of product development. Looking at its most recent quarters, it appears the company has achieved its goals. Kemet has posted four consecutive quarters of year-over-year operating income growth, as well as received a record 20 product patents in fiscal year 2015. In its latest reported quarter, it handily beat analysts' estimates for earnings per share by $0.07/share, thereby increasing its stock price nearly 15%. There is a strong correlation between rising company profits, which drives up company stock values, which in turn increases the company's bond values. These 10.5% high coupon, 30-month bonds, currently trading around 92.75, are indicating a yield to maturity that's over 14%. Given the probability of Kemet posting yet another banner quarter, we think it is likely that this bond will also increase in value. In light of this, we have marked these big cash flow bonds for an increased position within our global high yield fixed income portfolios, FX1 and FX2."
Valuing IBM By Comparison To Its Competitors,Nov. 3.15,"As of this moment, I'm looking at hefty unrealized losses on an outsize position in International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). In reviewing the situation, I evaluated the company by comparing it to the competitors listed on its most recent 10-K. This article presents the analysis and invites comment and criticism from readers.There is no data available for Dell, which is privately owned, and the data I used didn't contain information on Fujitsu. Aside from that, all major competitors are considered. I used Portfolio123 to develop the information, consisting of 3 year historical growth rates for EPS and Sales, together with average analyst estimates of long-term growth, average recommendations on a scale of 1 (strong buy) to 5 (sell) and forward P/E.Feeding the information into online multiple linear regression (abbreviated MLR) software, I received a formula for forward P/E, derived from the other variables, and calculated values for that metric, based on the formula developed.If IBM were valued on the same basis as its peers, forward P/E would be 12.7, rather than 9.4, resulting in a share price of $190. If it takes two years to reach that level, capital appreciation would be 16% per year, to which one can add the dividend, currently yielding 3.7%. The patient investor has a reasonable expectation of capital appreciation, and he will be paid to wait."
Why China Is So Important To Microsoft's Future,Dec.21.15,"China banned Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows 8 for government-related procurement last May 2014. The ban was part of a state directive over 'energy-saving' measures. It was definitely an angry reaction against Microsoft's decision to end support for Windows XP. The old Windows XP OS was still used by more than 50% of all computers in China.Microsoft's discontinuation of support/updates for Windows XP clearly exposed Chinese computers to virus and hacking attacks. The Chinese government did not like this and made its displeasure felt. Microsoft was previously in danger last year from China's antitrust allegations over the Windows operating system. China's government even helped create its own homegrown OS, NeoKylin that it wanted as a replacement for Windows.The anti-Windows sentiment of China even inspired American PC vendor Dell to sell many of its computers in China with NeoKylin OS pre-installed. The obvious threat was that Windows was going to become ostracized in China. The screen shot below reveals NeoKylin looks a lot like the old Windows XP operating system of Microsoft."
Intel Inside The World's Best Multi-Tasking 8-Inch Tablet,Jun. 2.15,"ASUSTeK (OTC:ASUUY) unveiled four new Android tablets Monday during the Computex 2015 event. The most impressive of the bunch is the 8-inch Asus ZenPad S 8.0 (Z580CA), which is equipped with a 64-bit 2.33 GHz Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Atom Z3580 quad-core processor.Asus was the first manufacturer to debut a 4GB RAM-equipped smartphone with the ZenFone 2 and it is again the pioneer in releasing the world's first 8-inch tablet with 4GB of RAM.The huge amount of RAM makes this tablet a multi-tasking powerhouse. While no official price tags were revealed yet, the other high-end hardware specs of the ZenPad S 8.0 hints that is a premium tablet that could compete with the $399++ Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad Mini 3 and Dell Venue 8 7000 premium tablets.Source: Lowyat.netThe image above from Lowyat.net also reveals that the ZenPad S 8.0 has the latest USB 3.0 Type-C port (used in the new MacBook Air 2015), 2K display (2048x1536 resolution), and Z Stylus compatibility. The Z Stylus is similar in purpose to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) tablet stylus for the Surface 3 and Surface Pro 3.The Zenpad S 8.0 is therefore ideal for enterprise users who are accustomed to the pen input style of the Surface 3 tablet and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) Galaxy Note. If Asus could get carrier support for this product (like what Xiaomi did with the Mi Pad tablet), the ZenPad S 8.0 might get bulk orders from Corporate IT managers looking for a cheaper alternative to the Galaxy Note 3/Surface 3."
Acer: A Shrinking PC Business And A Shrinking Share Value,Nov. 8.15,"Investors looking to augment their portfolio return with risker plays or who are just looking to play around with fun money should consider investing in Asian stocks, specifically Asian tech stocks, which can potentially yield outstanding returns in exchange for greater amounts of volatility. These sorts of investments can also double as the international exposure that investors are typically looking to add to their portfolios. Instead of blindly dumping some money into an international equity mutual fund, investors can instead choose to carefully pick international stocks with the same due diligence as how they pick domestic stocks.As opposed to a previous article I wrote about an Asian tech stock, one of the stocks investors should consider NOT adding (or shorting) in their portfolios is Acer (OTC:ASIYF), a Taiwan-based computer manufacturer that has been on a downward spiral for quite a while. Like many other PC-based Asian tech firms, Acer has had most of its business concentrated in the PC industry, an industry which has been on the decline for quite some time. Although the industry is undergoing consolidation as it shrinks and as market share is transferred to the largest players in the PC industry, Acer is not seeing the benefit of consolidation.While the rest of the big players in the PC industry, such as Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), HP (NYSE:HPQ) (NYSE:HPE), Dell, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), all have reaped the benefits of steadily increasing market share from industry consolidation, Acer's PC market share has been scraping the bottom of the barrel for the past several quarters. It looks as if Acer will only be able to hold its PC business constant at the very best, and the firm may even begin losing market share if consolidation continues to make the other big four PC players gain market share."
Understanding Amazon's Cash Conversion Cycle,Sep.23.15,"As we stated in our previous article, one of the attractive features of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is its ability to turn net losses to positive cash flow every year. The fuel driving this healthy cash-generation prowess is Amazon's negative cash conversion cycle. The cash conversion cycle is the number of days it takes for a company to convert resource inputs into cash flows, and is defined as DSO (days sales outstanding) plus DIO (days inventory outstanding) less DPO (days payable outstanding).Amazon's cash conversion cycle is negative, meaning it is generating revenue from customers before it has to pay its suppliers for inventory, among other things.Think of it simply this way. When you buy something on Amazon, you enter your credit card or PayPal info, and, depending on the transaction, Amazon turns that into cash relatively quickly. Amazon, though, doesn't have to pay its suppliers for a much longer time after it has turned its sales into cash. Because of this set-up, Amazon is generating cash from its sales regardless of whether or not each sale is profitable.The negative cash conversion cycle is indicative of a strong management team headed by Jeff Bezos, and illustrates management's efficient use of working capital. More or less, a negative cash conversion cycle is simply an interest free way to finance operations through borrowing from suppliers."
Microsoft: Bringing Windows 10 And Universal Apps To Vehicle Infotainment Would Change Everything,Dec. 7.15,"What is Microsoft's Universal Apps Strategy?The Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Universal Windows Platform app is a Windows experience that is built upon the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). At the core of UWP apps is the idea that users want their experiences to be mobile across ALL their devices, and they want to use whatever device is most convenient or productive for the task at hand.Windows 10 makes it easy to develop apps for one store to reach all Windows 10 devices - PC, tablet, phone and more. It's easier to support a number of screen sizes, and also a variety of interaction models, whether it be touch, mouse & keyboard, a game controller or a pen.Source: Microsoft.comThe Current State of AffairsCurrently, we have vehicle infotainment, which is functionally rich, but shares virtually no common interface elements across vehicle manufacturers, and sometimes across models within that same manufacturer.

Synthetic Biologics Under The Microscope,Nov.24.15,"The most difficult criteria when evaluating a biotech company is determining a realistic valuation.Unlike more conventional investments, biotechs have no operational history, no earnings, nebulous data, and high risk of bankruptcy. They are, perhaps, the only form of business where its value is determined simultaneously, and not sequentially.Due diligence in this sector can be simply overwhelming!Thus, in order to get an edge, savvy investors use special tools. Things like patent law, cash-burn, FDA regulation etc. And while all these tools are important, they unfortunately overlook the most vital tool of all. ---> Science.Without a firm grasp of a company's pipeline, on a scientific and economic level, you cannot value a company accurately.I repeat, it's impossible to value a biotechnology company if you don't fundamentally understand what it's trying to approve and trying to market. But the truth is, most people have never looked at a clinical report in their life.In this article, I provide in-depth detail of the clinical and preclinical history for Synthetic Biologic's (NYSEMKT:SYN) flagship drug SYN-004 aka (004), what it means for investors, and what it's worth.Of course, this is not exhaustive, but it provides a layman's understanding that I hope many can use for their benefit.But before jumping in, for those new to Synthetic Biologics, it's important to wrap your head around what 004 actually is."
"Carnegie Mellon Vs. Marvell: With $1.7 Billion At Stake, Who Should Win, And Will They Settle?",Sep. 1.15,"As I previously explained, the Federal Circuit's August 4, 2015, decision in Carnegie Mellon v. Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) did not end the parties' dispute, but instead left open a roughly $1.7 billion question: whether Marvell can be held liable under U.S. patent law for the sale of approximately 3.4 billion chips that have never entered and will never enter the United States.That question, in turn, rests on a deeper one: what is the meaning of ""sale"" within the United States under 35 U.S.C. § 271(A)?But before diving into the legal and factual intricacies at play, let's take a step back to appreciate the bigger picture.Marvell's shareholders, of course, are watching closely: roughly 30% of Marvell's market cap hangs in the balance.But they are not the only ones. The implications of the case are of profound interest to American technology companies, research universities and many others.Companies like Google (GOOGL; GOOG), HP (NYSE:HPQ), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Dell have warned the appellate court that a ruling in Carnegie Mellon's favor could motivate high-tech companies to move their operations and high paying jobs overseas, and also could disrupt international relations by extending American patent law into foreign jurisdictions. Several law professors have agreed. Universities, on the other hand, have argued that a ruling against Carnegie Mellon would deprive them of rightful returns on their extensive research investments.And yet, despite its profound potential externalities to numerous institutions, the case will most directly impact the lives and work of five people.On the one hand, three family members own nearly a fifth of Marvell.Since founding the company in 1995, Dr. Sehat Sutardja, his wife Weili Dai and his brother Dr. Pantas Sutardja have grown Marvell from seven employees to nearly 7,000. The company's success has brought them not only substantial wealth but also social prominence. Together, the three own 19% of the company."
ImageWare: New Broken Promises And No Revenue Ramp In Sight,Sep.18.15,"""Bad guys are really smart and they know a good thing when they are onto it.""""A lot of things that people say they can do, again, look closely as you do your due diligence, because they um, frankly, bluntly, they can't.""- Jim Miller, ImageWare CEO, Investor Presentation, September 10, 2015ImageWare is a ZeroThe last time we wrote about dishonest company management backtracking on unachievable promises at an investment conference, it was Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) in May of 2013. In spite of its multimillion-dollar deals with the likes of Dell and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), for which UNXL was actually receiving big chunks of cash up front, the company failed to deliver, and the stock has fallen 94% since.ImageWare (OTCQB:IWSY), like Uni-Pixel, is a company whose management has broken promise after promise to shareholders. Also like Uni-Pixel, ImageWare has signed deals with big name partners, which, for a while, gave it a veneer of legitimacy and gave reasonable people optimism for the prospect of rapid revenue growth and significant future profits. Unlike Uni-Pixel, however, ImageWare's partners have not paid the company large, upfront sums of cash. And also unlike Uni-Pixel, whose technology would have been disruptive, if it actually worked, ImageWare's remarkable product is nothing more revolutionary than an absurdly overpriced cloud-based secure database, which nobody truly needs and nobody wants at the ridiculously inflated price the company is trying to charge. Almost ImageWare's entire actual, tiny revenue stream comes from highly commoditized information technology integration work."
Dataram: Turnaround Firmly In Place,Sep.16.15,"For a stock that once traded above $25 around the financial crisis, Dataram Corporation (DRAM) has had a long fall to the current levels. The technology company provides a compelling investment as a corporate restructuring plan started earlier this year is starting to take fruition with a new executive team in place.The company is an independent manufacturer of memory products that increase the performance and life of servers, workstations, desktops, and laptops that was founded all the way back in 1967.

"Super Micro Computer Inc.: Growing Earnings, Falling Price",Dec.30.15,"My top pick for 2016 is Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI). In the last year, I have noticed that the market is selling dreams quite well. There are a lot of stocks that get ""pumped"" and ""dumped,"" which is a real disaster for the long-term investor who just wants normal companies whose business is getting stronger and stronger through the years. I do not expect SMCI to raise 5 times in the next year, but if they continue to do just business as usual this might be a nice addition to your portfolio with stable predictable results and a decent growth. The contest's price based on the stock performance is something that will unlock moral hazard and a lot of writers will choose extremely beaten down stocks or extremely risky stocks. My pick in SMCI is not a pick based on moral hazard, that will either fly or die, but is a stock in which I see a decent risk reward ratio and that I will really invest in.SMCI in simple words is selling servers. The competition in this sector includes names like HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Dell, Lenovo, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Huawei and almost all of the brands a normal person associates with IT. Just by looking at those names, you may think that this small company is not even worth researching but let's look at the recent trends in this sector.The table shows revenue growth for the first nine months of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014:Source: www.itcandor.comIt seems that SMCI is not scared of competition. While the market grew 1.6% in the first nine months of 2015, MSCI managed to grow 54%. The first thing I notice when looking at this table is that SMCI is the only company that you may have never heard. When you have a not so popular company outperforming its competition, it has to be price/quality. Another possible conclusion can be that it is just a small growing company and the growth rate is easier to achieve. This is exactly what I am searching - a high quality product with a growing perspective."

According to IBM's earnings reports, IBM's Power Architecture Server business grew revenue in both quarters, by 5% y/y in Q2 and by 2% y/y in Q3.The fact that IBM chose to dump its Intel server business but keep the Power Architecture (PA, the heir to the PowerPC) servers should pique the curiosity of investors. Didn't Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) kill off the PowerPC when it switched the Mac to Intel back in 2006? Not quite. IBM shifted its focus for the PowerPC to servers as a complement to its Z series mainframe business.IBM's decision says a lot. IBM looked out over the semiconductor business landscape and realized that processors based on ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) processor IP had become dominant in mobile computing, and seemed to be moving beyond mobile devices into mainstream personal computing and into servers as well."

EMC-Dell Merger (Along With VMware) Provides Arbitrage Opportunities,Mar.31.16,"The dDealDell, owned by Michael Dell (founder and CEO), MSD Partners and Silver Lake, is to acquire EMC Corporation (EMC), while maintaining VMware (NYSE:VMW) as a publicly-traded company. EMC Corp currently owns 81% of VMware, with the remaining 19% being publicly listed.Under the terms of the deal, EMC shareholders will receive $24.05 per share in cash in addition to tracking stock linked to a portion of EMC's economic interest in the VMware business. Broadly, the tracking shares will track 65% of EMC's current 81% interest in VMware (i.e., equating to 53% direct economic interest in VMware). EMC shareholders are expected to receive approximately 0.111 VMW Tracking Shares for each EMC share held by them.The transaction is expected to close in mid-2016 (expected between May and October 2016). Based on recent updates from EMC and Dell, the merger is on schedule and should close within the anticipated deadline.Deal StructureThe below diagram shows the commercial deal structure post closing.The key features of the VMware Tracking shares are:They will be listed and freely traded (there will be 223m VMW Tracking shares compared to just 80m VMware shares currently traded - this should offer a liquid market for the VMW Tracking shares).They will track Denali's 53% economic interest in VMware (Denali is the parent of Dell which will acquire EMC Corp).Denali will have the ability attribute other assets of equal value in exchange for the VMware shares tracked (subject to authorization by an independent committee which will take care of the interests of the VMware Tracking shareholders).VMware Tracking Shares will have no voting rights in VMware.VMware Tracking Shares will be exposed to credit risk of Denali (i.e., if Dell / Denali goes kaput, the Tracking Shares go kaput).Denali will retain the right to redeem and/or buy-out the VMware Tracking Shares or convert them to Denali or a Denali sub common."
How To Play The EMC-Dell Merger,May.10.16,"EMC Corporation (EMC) is one of a handful of tech companies that escaped the dot-com bubble alive. In the current decade, the stock has traded roughly at consolidation, prompting me to scratch my head as to why investors would buy this stock. Three years ago, the company likely had a similar thought and initiated a dividend program for its shareholders.While the yield is relatively low for a dividend stock, it does look appealing from the perspective of an investor looking for a dividend stock in the tech industry. Still, the dividend has only been raised once since its initiation in 2013. While clearly not a dividend grower, perhaps the dividend versus price is stable, seeing as both these parameters are roughly stable?If so, EMC could be seen as an income generation asset more than anything. And because of its tendency to trend sideways no matter what (EMC barely moves even after earnings surprises), EMC could bring in even more stable income when paired with sideways options strategies. If we find both the stock and dividend to be stable, a sideways options strategy could be a safe method with which to increase your income from EMC.Yet a sideways thesis is not exactly correct, as Dell is buying up EMC at a price that allows an arbitrage play on the stock, assuming all goes well. Once the deal is completed, stockholders will receive $24.05 per share and .111 shares of a tracking stock that is somewhat hard to value. Nevertheless, this will bring the total value of EMC to at least $30."
EMC Trading Below Dell's $24.05 Bid,Jan.26.16,"EMC (EMC) is expected to release fourth-quarter earnings before the market opens on Wednesday. VMware (NYSE:VMW) is expected to announce earnings after the market closes Tuesday.Dell made a bid for EMC on October 12, 2015, that was $24.05 in cash plus tracking stock. The total value was estimated to be $33.15. Today EMC closed at $23.98.Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the ""Effective Time""), each share of Company common stock, par value $0.01 per share (""Company Common Stock""), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and other than shares with respect to which appraisal rights may be properly exercised and not withdrawn) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive {(I)} $24.05 in cash, without interest (the ""Cash Consideration""), and (ii) a number of shares of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of Parent designated as Class V Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the ""Class V Common Stock""), equal to the quotient obtained by dividing {(A)} 222,966,450 by {(B)} the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares (together with the Cash Consideration, the ""Merger Consideration""). The aggregate number of shares of Class V Common Stock issued as Merger Consideration in the transaction is intended to represent 65% of the Company's economic interest in the approximately 81% of the outstanding shares of VMware, Inc. (""VMware"") currently owned by the Company, reflecting approximately 53% of the total economic interest in the outstanding shares of VMware. Upon completion of the transaction, Parent will retain the remaining 28% of the total economic interest in the outstanding shares of VMware. Because any shares with respect to which appraisal rights may be properly exercised and not withdrawn would not receive Class V Common Stock, any proper exercise of appraisal rights would decrease the aggregate number of shares of Class V Common Stock issued in the Merger and increase Parent's retained interest in the VMware business. Based on the estimated number of shares of Company Common Stock at the closing of the transaction, Company shareholders are expected to receive approximately 0.111 shares of Class V Common Stock for each share of Company Common Stock. Assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a valuation for each share of Class V Common Stock of $81.78, the intraday volume-weighted average price for VMware on Wednesday, October 7, 2015, Company shareholders would receive a total combined consideration of $33.15 per share of Company Common Stock. The value of the Class V Common Stock may vary from the market price of VMware given the different characteristics and rights of the two stocks. The rights of holders of the Class V Common Stock will be governed by the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Parent to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and made effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the ""Parent Certificate""), (ii) by-laws to be adopted by Parent's Board of Directors concurrently with the filing of the Parent Certificate (the ""Parent By-laws"") and {(NASDAQ:III)} a Tracking Stock Policy Statement to be adopted by Parent's Board of Directors concurrently with the filing of the Parent Certificate (the ""Tracking Stock Policy Statement"")."
"Dell To End The IPO Drought, But Is SecureWorks A Buy?",Apr. 4.16,"Shortly after Dell and EMC (NYSE:EMC) announced the expected merger between the two computing giants last year, speculation started around the businesses that Dell will offload in order to finance the massive $67B deal. Many tried to assess how Dell and EMC would merge their cyber security divisions, software divisions, professional services, and more as they formed the new computing behemoth. Investors look closely to see what the efficiencies that the merger brings and which assets Dell offers to the highest bidder to help finance the deal. Last week, Dell made one of the most significant steps in offloading assets when the company announced that Japan's NTT agreed to buy Dell's IT services unit (aka Perot Systems) for an amount slightly above $3B.The second significant step Dell made is to take its cyber security company, SecureWorks (Pending:SCWX), public and slightly reduce the substantial size of the Dell-EMC cyber security business that includes, besides SecureWorks, RSA, Pivotal, and VMware's NSX. Even though SecureWorks filed its S-1 in December of last year, unrest in the markets and private market valuation bubble concerns drove many companies to halt their IPO plans until the markets settled down. So far in 2016, the markets have not settled down, and the IPO market is experiencing its slowest first quarter since 2009, as shown in the chart below. However, Dell has to proceed with its plans to complete the EMC deal, which leaves no other way than to take SecureWorks public despite the current IPO market."
CommVault - Is It Worth Trying To Catch The Falling Knife?,Jan.22.16,"Introduction:CommVault (NASDAQ:CVLT) is a leading provider of software-based solutions that allow its users to maximize their storage efficiency and to back up and recover their physical storage using software technology. CommVault's shares peaked more than two years ago at a price just shy of $90/share. Since that time, the shares have gone through 3 distinct downward legs. Initially the absurd valuation that was reached at the peak was undone. That was followed shortly thereafter by investor concerns about the longer term growth of the storage space and has most recently been followed by investor alarm that almost all companies in the enterprise storage world were likely to either miss estimates or significantly revise short-term guidance.CommVault had missed its operating targets significantly for two quarters before finally printing respectable results for the quarter that ended 9/30/15. Despite achieving a reasonable quarter vis-à-vis expectations, CommVault shares, because of overall market conditions and because they are lumped as part of the enterprise storage space, have declined about 30% in less than 2 months. And lots of that damage was done in just the last few days in the wake of a downgrade by a brokerage who had recommended the name going back several years. As the company has announced an earnings release date for January 27, 2016, I have to assume that the results to be reported for the December quarter are not the ones in jeopardy but rather the expectations investors have for the company's fiscal 2017 year and beyond."
"Lazard: Unknown, Undervalued And Unusually Lucrative",May. 9.16,"When one thinks of investment banking, names such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) spring to mind. Mention Lazard Ltd. (NYSE:LAZ) to someone, however, and more often than not you may find yourself greeted with a blank stare.Lazard may not be a name that has initial resonance with many, but they are not a new kid on the block either. The firm, which divides its operations into financial advisory services and asset management services, can trace its roots back to 1848, when it was established as a dry goods business in New Orleans by a motley trio of Frenchmen: the brothers Lazard (Alexandre, Lazare, and Simon). They quickly expanded in the next decade into banking activities, setting the stage for the firm as it exists today.OverviewThe firm that the Lazard brothers set up in the mid-19th century has grown since then into a global investment banking, financial advisory and asset management provider with a market capitalization of $4.47 billion which is headquartered in Bermuda and has 47 offices in 27 countries.Lazard is a top-tier advisory business within global finance. Of the ten largest M&A (mergers and acquisitions) transactions that occurred in 2015, Lazard advised on six of them. The transactions that Lazard was directly involved with were:Anheuser-Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD) and SABMiller (OTCPK:SBMRF) (OTCPK:SBMRY)Dell and EMC Corp (NYSE:EMC)Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW) and DuPont (NYSE:DD)Energy Transfer Equity (NYSE:ETE) and Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB)Kraft Foods Group and HJ Heinz - now Kraft-Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC)Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.B) and BG Group (OTCQX:BRGXF) (OTCQX:BRGYY)Lazard is also a top-tier asset manager. It manages a diverse range of equities and fixed income assets. Its global equities as of March 31st, 2016 are worth $32 billion; its multi-regional equities are worth $53 billion; its emerging markets equities are worth $39 billion; and its local assets are worth $31 billion. Its fixed-income assets in total are worth $30 billion as of March 31st, 2016.Competitive AdvantageLazard has diversified its operations by business sector and by geography. By business sector, 54% of Lazard's operating revenue between March 2015 and March 2016 was from its financial advisory sector, 45% was from asset management, and 1% was from its corporate segment. By geography, for the same timeframe, 60% of operating revenue was derived from North America, 32% was derived from Europe, and 8% came from the rest of the world. This diversity prevents Lazard being too dependent upon any one sector or geographic area for revenue, which makes it much more durable.In addition, Lazard has a formidable reputation within the financial sector. While it may not be a household name, it is a top-tier advisory business in global finance. Consult the list of M&A transactions above with which Lazard was involved. The fact that Lazard was called upon to advise in these large and complex transactions is indicative of the level of esteem that they are held in within the business world. This esteem is borne out of the vast global network of relationships that it has cultivated in business and in government over the course of its existence, and the reputation they have cultivated provides them with a strong competitive advantage.The weakness that Lazard has is the very sector that they are in: they face strong competition from the more prominent firms named at the start of this article - Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, among others. That is not to say that Lazard is in any danger of going out of business, but the competition provided by these larger firms is a weakness that investors should be aware of in advance.ValuationCurrently, Lazard is trading in the mid-$30 range at a price-to-earnings ratio of 4.46, offering a 4.50% dividend yield and a 47.6% payout ratio. This is a sustainable ratio, and means that Lazard has the ability to grow its current dividend going forward, or at the very least maintain it. A dividend cut seems unlikely.As to fair value, I shall use a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis: and I will clarify something regarding the way I have used DCF up to this point. Traditionally, a DCF model uses free cash flow, or FCF, not earnings per share, or EPS. I have been using EPS as stock prices generally follow earnings rather than cash flow, which can be lumpy. Furthermore, FCF is much more backward looking in a DCF analysis than EPS is. I make no claim to originality in this view, as can be gleaned from this link, which discusses the issue more thoroughly. However, FCF is not without merit as a metric, and going forward I will use both in calculating fair value for stocks, just to keep things in check.First, the FCF analysis: if I average out the FCF for Lazard over the last ten years, based on Morningstar's data, I get an average FCF of $394.7 million. The average FCF growth rate for the same period is 30%. Using a discount rate of 11% (the average return of the stock market, adjusted for inflation and including dividends) projected over the next five years, with subsequent growth projected at 2.2% (in line with the projected average inflation rate for 2016-2020), and with 129.77 million shares outstanding, fair value is calculated at $116.89, yielding a possible 25.41% annual return. This provides a margin of safety of 71%.Now, the EPS analysis: Lazard's earnings per share (trailing twelve months) was $7.49, and the projected earnings-per-share growth rate for the next five years is 0.43%, trailing off to 5% thereafter. Using a discount rate of 11% (the average return of the stock market, adjusted for inflation and including dividends), I calculate fair value at $107.49. This provides a 69% margin of safety.There is only a 2% difference in margin of safety between the two methods employed, and the low P/E ratio suggests that Lazard is in any case very undervalued. So averaging these figures out, Lazard's fair value comes to $112.19, with a 70% margin of safety. The stock is trading at a considerable discount to its intrinsic value.ConclusionIn a stock market where many companies are overvalued or trading at fair value, Lazard is an absolute bargain. Though not widely known, it is a long-established firm with strong competitive advantages in a ferociously competitive sector, has an above-average dividend yield coupled with a sustainable payout ratio, and is trading at a considerable discount relative to its intrinsic value. While it recently missed its Q1 EPS by 15%, and also missed on revenue, in the long-run an investor who buys Lazard will have hit the mark, especially at its current valuation.DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial professional and accept no responsibility for any investment decisions a reader makes.

Not All That Glitters Is Gold With SecureWorks,Apr.11.16,"Introduction to SecureWorksIf you've heard of Dell computers, which is now private, then you're close to learning about SecureWorks (NASDAQ:SCWX). Just like Dell, SecureWorks is a subsidiary of Denali Holdings and was acquired by Dell in 2011 (Nasdaq). SecureWorks is a cyber security company that helps its customers, which are a variety of corporations, protect their computer systems from hackers (WSJ) via a subscription service and contracts (Nasdaq). About 80% of SecureWorks revenues are generated from the subscription services part of the business that primarily handles the management of security (Channelnomics). The other services range from firewall protection to consulting, including web and email security as well as many other monitoring and management services. Clients vary among size and industry, but are primarily Fortune 100 or mid-size firms. SecureWorks also is a global company and has spread its services across the United States, Middle East, Europe, Asia, South America and Africa (Wikipedia). The company's largest customer is Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which brings in about 12% of revenues (Nasdaq).Additionally, SecureWorks manages a platform focused on counter threat that focuses on preventative cyber security measures, such as suspicious activity and malicious events detection. ""The platform aggregates as many as 150 billion incidents to represent activity or trends across the client's network"" (Nasdaq). The platform was designed to find trends and continuously build off of its prior ""knowledge"" in order to pick up on security threats before they even arrive. The platform also includes incident response features (Nasdaq).SecureWorks is looking to go public this month on the Nasdaq under the ticker ""SCWX."" If the company is able to follow through, it is notorious for possibly being the first US technology firm to go public in 2016, which has been very rare recently. The last company to file was a no-name Chinese company in December of 2015 (WSJ). SecureWorks plans on using any proceeds from the offering for working capital, operations, and/or investments, such as acquisitions to expand (Channelnomics)."

Opportunistic Investing - The Case For Merger Appraisal Rights,"May 26, 2016 9:42 AM ET","By Hedge Fund Solutions GroupThis niche, legally intensive strategy has the potential for providing compelling uncorrelated returns.U.S. mergers and acquisitions activity surged to an all-time high in 2015, with deal volume growing over 50% year-over-year to approximately $2.3 trillion.1 Coinciding with this M&A growth has been an increase in corporate litigation and, in particular, cases in which shareholders have exercised their rights to seek appraisal to challenge the price offered in a buyout. In this article, we discuss appraisal rights in detail and why we believe the strategy represents a compelling investment opportunity.OverviewAppraisal rights exist to ensure that minority shareholders receive fair value for their shares when a company is acquired in a cash deal. While most states have some form of appraisal remedy (the rules vary significantly from state to state), Delaware is the leading statutory example, with more than half of U.S. public companies incorporated in the state.2 Given Delaware's extensive case law on the subject, we will focus our thoughts on appraisal rights as it applies to the Delaware General Corporation Law.Appraisal rights provide shareholders in an acquisition with a legal remedy to petition for an independent determination of fair value as an alternative to accepting the offered deal price. Those seeking appraisal forgo the merger consideration in anticipation that the awarded amount through a judicial determination or settlement will be higher. In order to demand appraisal, shareholders must vote against the transaction (or abstain) and adhere to strict procedural requirements, including several notice provisions. While most cases are settled privately before going to court, those that go to litigation involve discovery along with expert witness reports and rebuttals. A general overview of an appraisal proceeding is provided in Figure 3.1."
VMware: A Potential Blast From The Past,Apr.22.16,"Putting the conclusion first:VMware (NYSE:VMW) recently reported results of its fiscal Q1. The results were decent and not more than that but the shares soared almost 15%. Much of the share price increase has to do with the announcement that the company will resume share buybacks once the merger between VMware's parent, EMC and Dell is completed sometime in either Q2 or Q3. The transaction is quite complex in terms of its structure and the potential for VMW shareholders. With a new tracking stock to be available, there is going to be lots more stock for sale, I imagine.But I am going to try to look beyond all of those factors and simply focus on the potential that VMW enjoys in becoming a leader in providing software infrastructure in the hybrid cloud space. I am also going to speculate a bit about the potential revenue synergies of the impending transaction as they may impact VMW. The net of it all is that with decent execution and focus, VMW can return to moderate growth and improvements in operating margins as well. In addition, the cachet of being a leading provider in the cloud area, will almost certainly lead to higher valuations as investors search for cloud stories that are not valued in nosebleed territory. I think with the merger impending; it is more prudent to attempt to scale into the shares rather than trying to establish an entire position immediately. If, as is possible, the shares encounter significant headwinds when the merger is complete, I would be far more aggressive in stepping up purchases."
CheckPoint-On Its Way To The #2 Position At Least By Sales Ranking In The Network Security Space,May.24.16,"Check Point-Becoming #2 is really an uncomfortable place to beI have always wondered what it must be like to have had a long run as #1 in the world and then cede the title. Friday's WSJ carried an article to the effect that Rafael Nadal had been bumped up to a 4 th seed at Wimbledon because of an extended recovery period for Roger Federer. Rafael has apparently lost much of his hair and has a plethora of injuries and is only ranked 9 th in the world tennis rankings. I know that the purpose of the article was to make us realize the valor and pluckiness of the erstwhile champion, and perhaps I should feel that way-but really feeling sorry for Rafael Nadal is a bit beyond my compass.Perhaps less heralded, but of equal significance to that narrow group of people who follow tech stocks is that the crown in the cyber-security space is in the process of passing from Check Point (NASDAQ:CHKP) to Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW). Not in profits to be sure-that day is in the unforeseeable future. But in terms of reported revenues which is an important milestone, I believe. PANW is expected to report around $340 million in revenues when it releases its fiscal Q3 earnings after the close on Thursday. Depending on how it guides and the inevitable revisions to analyst consensus estimates, PANW is forecast to reach $390 million in revenues in the quarter that will end 7/31.There are many readers on this site and elsewhere who have essentially anthropomorphized Check Point shares. I can understand that readers/investors do not like to see their investment beliefs challenged. All I can say is that I try to be open and objective to commentators but I also try to do analysis of what I see and not to accept the received wisdom. And this article is not meant to be an evaluation of the company's technology vis-à-vis its competitors. It is meant to be a discussion of what the financial outlook is for this company as it loses its long held #1 position in security networking. It is really meant to be a discussion in whether Check Point can produce positive alpha for investors."
SecureWorks' Success Depends On Management's Ability To Cut Costs,Apr.25.16,"After their lackluster debut on the Nasdaq last Friday, many are skeptical of whether or not SecureWorks (NASDAQ:SCWX) can survive as a public company. The source of this doubt is management's inability to turn a profit despite double-digit revenue and client base growth. The question is: Will management be able to cut costs now that they are no longer part of Dell? Let's take a look at the fundamentals and see what SecureWorks is worth, assuming management is able to exercise its new found freedom effectively.The MarketSecureWorks competes in the security services IT outsourcing, consulting and managed security markets. Gartner Inc. estimates the security services IT outsourcing and consulting services market was $25.0 billion in 2013, and expects 11% annual growth to $47.0 billion in 2019. Frost & Sullivan estimates that sales of managed security services were $6.9 billion globally in 2013, and expects sales to grow to $12.8 billion globally, at an annual growth rate of 13%.The CompanySecureWorks is a cyber security company that provides security services to clients, typically through subscription-based products. The services they provide are:Managed Security Offerings - Providing clients with global visibility and insight into malicious activity in their network environments and enable them to detect and remediate threats quickly and effectively.Threat Intelligence - Delivering early warnings of vulnerabilities and threats and provide actionable security intelligence to address these problems, typically packaged with managed security offerings.Security and Risk Consulting - Advise clients on a variety of information security and risk-related matters, such as how to design and build strategic security programs, assess and test security capabilities and meet regulatory compliance requirements.Incident Response - Help clients rapidly analyze, contain and remediate security breaches to minimize their duration and impactSecureWorks currently has over 4,200 clients in 59 countries worldwide.The ModelNow that we've examined the market and know a little bit about SecureWorks and what they do, let's look at the valuation model we've built for them.SecureWorks' market share is approximately 0.87% of the global IT security outsourcing, consulting and managed security markets. Our model forecasts market share growth to continue at a steady pace and eventually reaching 2.35% market saturation in 2030.We see SecureWorks' client base continuing to grow, but at a decreasing rate, eventually reaching a size of 10,015 clients in 2030.Our model forecasts average monthly revenue per client to continue growing as businesses continue to increase their dependence on the internet and their need for security increases.Above is our model's full forecast for SecureWorks. We expect SecureWorks to begin turning a net profit in 2019. We see gross margins and SG&A spending as a percent of revenue reaching 62% and 36%, respectively, as long as management is able to efficiently cut costs and restructure now that they are no longer a part of Dell.Using a very conservative terminal rate of -2% and discount rate of 10%, our model values SecureWorks at $15.23 a share. Using a slightly less, but still conservative, terminal rate of 0% and discount rate of 8%, our model values it at $26.58 a share. This means that SecureWorks' shares are trading at a 9% to 90% discount to their projected values.RisksThere are several risks associated with SecureWorks, some of which are:The risk of losing large customers. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), for example, accounts for 9% of SecureWorks' revenue.The majority of their clients are in the financial services industry which could affect them, if changes in the industry affect demand for their products.The risk of management being unable to effectively cut costs and restructure.ConclusionIn conclusion, SecureWorks' future will likely be dictated by management's ability to cut costs, which they haven't shown an ability to do as a subsidiary of Dell. If you believe that management will be able to operate effectively now that they are no longer a part of Dell, then it trading at a significant discount to its intrinsic value would be a viable long candidate. If you don't believe in management, then we don't feel that SecureWorks is a viable short candidate because its valuation already reflects the management risk.Here is a link to the model"

The company was acquired by Dell in 2011 for $612mm and recently IPO'd for $1.12bn as part of Dell's financing strategy to purchase EMC (NYSE:EMC). The company offers Managed Security and Consulting Services to 4,200 clients in 59 countries. Approximately, 80% of FY16 revenue is recurring from managed security contracts with an average duration of 2 years.About half of the managed security clients pay full contract value upfront. The managed security space is highly competitive and fragmented with large well-funded corporations such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), which currently has the largest market share at ~4%, and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). SecureWorks is the only pure-play cyber security-focused company in the space with ~3% market share in 2015 according to Gartner research.The company's main technology evolves around a Counter Threat Platform (""CTP"") that analyzes 160bn global events daily and uses machine learning to seek out common traits of potential security threats. The platform is a multi-tenant, distributed architecture meaning that multiple groups of users can access the platform with each computing entity having separate processing power and memory so that a failure allows other entities to pick up the slack.This is incredibly important for a service that is trying to prevent threats which are occurring 24/7. According to management, the number of events analyzed by the CTP doubles every 16 months creating a large network effect that compounds as more customers are added allowing better threat prevention. This engine fuels many of the other products that the company offers."
"Micron: Awkward, But There Is Vision",Apr.13.16,"This is a break from my three-part series on the Hybrid Memory Cube (certainly feel free to check out parts one and two if you're curious). I did watch Micron's (NASDAQ:MU) webcast and feel the need to inject a short summary of my perspective.To the PointIn the commentary of many Micron articles here on Seeking Alpha, a theme has emerged:Mark Durcan often communicates with a dollop of clumsy.Micron is being run by the engineers and not by the canonical Alpha.While I agree with both of these, I do see a lot of vision in Micron as of late. Let me be clear: it certainly appears Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) took their ball and left Micron, who are now being forced to pick up the pieces and go home. Albeit a bit awkward, Tuesday's ""Enterprising the Data Center"" event was the first step in that process.When Micron initially signed Dell's Darren Thomas in 2014, my gut reaction was that ""they're going to sell turnkey products to the end users."" This seemed like a clever idea to me because I am an end user of these ""enterprise"" products and have saved my employer lots of money by cobbling systems with open technologies. There are dozens of network storage startups out there all doing the same thing at substantial markup:Buy a stack of Intel-based Super Micro hardware.Finish the system with DRAM, SSDs and controllers of choice.Install Linux (or other free Unix variant) to facilitate the storage software.Polish the product with a nice custom interface and VMware integration.A few will go beyond this cookie-cutting with actual innovation, but it is well-known that innovation in storage will attract lawsuits from NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), among others. If the hardware breaks, the startups need only contact Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) to fix the hardware in the field. This is the network storage startup equivalent of being ""fabless."""

Evercore thinks Google's increasing ability to sell search and video ads based on search and browsing history is providing a lift.Noteworthy Tech NewsMicrosoft and Google agree to drop regulatory complaints against each other - The latest sign an era of detente is emerging among tech giants in the legal/political realm. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google had already settled their far-reaching patent dispute in 2015. That occurred a year after Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) settled their patent dispute. Microsoft and Apple have long had a patent cross-licensing deal in place - probably because each could sue the other into oblivion, and only patent lawyers would benefit if they did."

What Is Your Sell Criteria?,"Apr. 28, 2016 9:06 PM ET","Every stock market cycle has its darlings - the stocks investors believe can do no wrong. I remember 1999 all too well. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Dell (private since 2013) were two of the stocks that investors fell in love with during that era. However, those investors soon learned that loving a stock could have nasty consequences, because it is difficult to part with something you love.These stocks, and many others, were devastated in the ensuing months and years. The ""unattached"" owners of these stocks disposed of their holdings as prices dropped or earnings failed to materialize. These disciplined investors had pre-defined criteria to alert them it was time to sell. The stock lovers lacked such discipline and went through various stages of denial, justification, rationalization and other emotions as they watched their beloved stocks sink lower and lower. In the current market cycle, it's hard to imagine a stock that is more loved than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).Back in 1999, it was despised, and many analysts were not convinced the company would even survive, let alone flourish. Fast forward to 2012, it became the most valuable company in history in terms of market capitalization, surpassing Microsoft's December 30, 1999, valuation. Yesterday, it was still the largest component of the S&P 500 Index, accounting for 3.17% of the Index.However, Apple's stock price peaked 14 months ago at $133. On Tuesday, it closed below $105, and yesterday it closed below $98. That is more than 26% drop in 14 months. Apple released its quarterly earnings report, which is the reason for the new downdraft. Earnings fell short of expectations by coming in at $1.90 per share, which was 10 cents below expectations and 18.5% below a year ago. Revenue fell by 13%, marking its first revenue decline in 13 years, and the first ever since the stock achieved ""darling"" status.Apple also reported that iPhone sales fell for the first time in history. Now might be a good time to ask yourself if you are an investor or lover of Apple stock. It is already in a bear market, so if you haven't sold it yet, then when will you sell it? You didn't sell when it dropped 15%, and you didn't sell when it dropped 25%. What will it take? A 50% drop? A 70% drop? Two quarters of declining revenue? Many people are selling their Apple shares, perhaps because it posted its first revenue decline in 13 years or perhaps because its price dropped below $100. Then again, an equal number of shares are being bought. It's a high volume day for Apple. I'm not predicting further demise for Apple stock, as this could turn out to be a great buying opportunity. What I'm suggesting is that you objectively consider your criteria for selling Apple or any other stock. Be sure to have an exit plan, preferably before you buy."
"IDC's Cloud Forecast Spells Trouble For HPE, EMC, And NetApp, And An Opportunity For Others",Apr.11.16,"46% of all spending on ""IT infrastructure"" (referred to as servers, storage, and switches) will go towards cloud infrastructures by 2020, predicts IDC. A lot of that growth will come at the expense of traditional data center infrastructure gear, whose spending share is expected to drop to 54% from 69.8% in 2015.IDC sees spending on traditional gear declining at a 1.3% CAGR from 2015-2020. That estimate might be conservative, given a 4% drop is expected in 2016. Forex is admittedly a 2016 headwind. Gartner has forecast total 2016 IT spend (whether on-premise or cloud) will drop 0.5% in 2016, with forex and international macro pressures weighing on sales.Meanwhile, spending on cloud infrastructure gear is expected to see a 12.5% CAGR, with public and private cloud spending respectively growing at 13.8% and 10.2% compound annual rates. 30.2% of 2020 server/storage/switch spend is expected to go towards public clouds, and 15.8% towards private clouds. A lot of that spending will go to contract manufacturers of white-box hardware, such as Quanta, Wistron, and Compal. They've been doing brisk business selling to the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)."

OpenStack Cloud Is The Telecommunications Mainstream,Apr.27.16,"Because the big telcos have finally bitten the cloud bullet, their industry, and tech generally, has been primed for its next recovery.At the OpenStack Summit in Austin this week, the message from AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) was clear. The phone network as we knew it is dead. It has been replaced by a cloud fabric linking data centers with client devices.A few of the old data center suppliers seem to have survived the transition. Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), which supplied old-style data centers a decade ago, are still players today, thanks to the telcos. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) remains a primary supplier as well. But the companies that once supplied high-end switching gear that distinguished between ""telco"" and ""computer networking"" markets, companies like Nokia (NYSE:NOK) unit Alcatel-Lucent, and Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), are having to find niches.The carrier wins are also big for Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), the open source software company, which over the last few years seemed to be watching Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) run away with the cloud market based on proprietary ""public cloud"" technology, as the ""hybrid"" cloud market it hoped to prosper on was slow to develop. The carrier commitment gave Red Hat a firm base, and the mainstream of corporate technology is now firmly in OpenStack's corner.Meanwhile, last-mile gigabit networks continue to snake their way into a few lucky markets, further centralizing tech-related industries among a few major centers. On my own street in Atlanta, where 20 years ago BellSouth had a single unshielded wire running on the phone poles, this year I have seen two fiber runs laid. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) joined Verizon Wireless to run fiber under the sidewalk. AT&T is running fiber along phone poles. The neighbors are all excited about sightings of Google, which also plans an overbuild. Cities without such gigabit-speed connections could be left by the wayside over the next few years, as could suburbs within those cities."
Kohl's Needs Privacy,Jan.17.16,"Elevator pitchOn 01/10/2016, the Wall Street Journal reported that Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) is considering going private or breaking up. it is essential to note that the underlying message is not whether or not Kohl's decides to go private or break-up, but the fact that the firm is considering ways to unleash shareholder value. This underlying message is what makes Kohl's a good opportunity.In the last nine months, Kohl's share price has declined by ~40% and its overall performance has been relatively low compared to its peer group and the S&P 500 as shown in Figure 1.Figure 1: (Kohl's 2015 10K)Since the financial crisis, Kohl's has made considerable progress to reposition itself for growth, bolster investor confidence through dividends and buybacks and it has invested heavily in e-commerce by leveraging its 1,200 stores to create initiatives such as buy online and pick in-store. Despite these efforts, Kohl's still trades at half its sales and has a P/E ratio which is ~46% below its industry average.But it could take time for Kohl's to realize its true value as a public company. Its investments in e-commerce, developing efficient distribution channels and expanding margins to historical levels needs time and patience. Patience that the street does not have."
Apple Is #2,Feb. 3.16,"Welcome to the Ex-#1 issue of M&A DailyAppleApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) temporarily lost its title as most valuable company in the world to Google (GOOG/GOOGL). Apple guided that iPhone sales this quarter will decline for the first time ever. Shares trade at about 10x forward PE and about 5x EV/EBITDA. They have a huge cash balance of about $150 billion in net cash. Almost all of their sell side analysts love it. It is as well covered as it gets and 85% having buy ratings.What's the history of investing in extremely large tech companies at value prices? Not good. IBM (NYSE:IBM), HP (NYSE:HPQ), Dell and others did extremely poorly when they got very big, even when they appeared to be cheap. When technology companies trade at a big discounts, it is normally because earnings are about to fall off the cliff and the market has efficiently adjusted.History of investing in the largest company in the world does not inspire confidence either. This is typically followed by mean reversion. In the case of Apple, it is basically a consumer electronics product company, not a technology company. Over half of revenue is from iPhones; revenue numbers probably understate the case since a lot of service revenue is from the iPhone too.The all in price they charge for iPhones has held steady at about $700 since 2011. Over that time, Android has dropped from $400 to $200. Apple cannot hold its price level much longer. The history of consumer electronics is consistent with big price cuts. As that price comes down, Apple revenue, profit margins, and profit are likely to drop."

Dell Technologies: VMWare Tracking Stock Offers A Compelling Arbitrage Opportunity,Sep.12.16,"Dell Technologies Inc - V Share Class (NYSE:DVMT) represents the tracking stock for its ownership stake in VMWare (NYSE:VMW) after completing its acquisition of EMC on September 7th. As part of the deal, EMC (EMC) shareholders received 24.05 in cash and 0.111 shares of this newly issued tracking stock. I believe the tracking stock offers a compelling investment opportunity given its 33% discount to VMW shares which should close to 10-15% in the medium term given a number of catalysts. The tracking stock let's investors buy into VMW for only 10X earnings ex. cash and can be turned into a market-neutral investment strategy by selling short an equivalent number of shares of VMW.Tracking stocks serve as a way to represent the economic performance of a company's subsidiary but they don't actually offer ownership of the underlying assets (or voting rights) so it is logical that they trade for less than common shares. The most relevant current example of tracking stocks is the Liberty Media complex which is managed by well-known master capital-allocator and value creator John Malone. These are represented by Liberty Ventures (LVNTA) (LVNTB), QVC (QVCA) (QVCB) Liberty Braves (NASDAQ:BATRA) (OTCQB:BATRB) (NASDAQ:BATRK) and SiriusXM (NASDAQ:LSXMA) (NASDAQ:LSXMB) (NASDAQ:LSXMK). These on average trade at a 10% discount to NAV. Some possible reasons for the VMW tracking stock's larger discount to NAV is that it is subject to Dell's credit risk which is highly levered after completing the transaction, but this I believe is overstated given that Dell has been very explicit on their intentions to use most of the free cash flow (and non-core asset divestures that will take place) to de-lever. Moreover Moody's upgraded Dell's debt complex after the deal closing this week which should serve as a positive catalyst. Another catalyst this week was Dell's earnings report where they announced $1 billion in buyback of the Tracking Stock which not only will be accretive to existing shareholders but serves as a firm statement from Dell acknowledging the discount to the NAV and a good investment opportunity for them to retire shares at current price levels."
Can IBM Win The Storage War Against Dell-EMC?,Aug.29.16,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) has launched its new Storwize all-flash storage portfolio targeted at enterprises that run cloud or cognitive applications and workloads. The company also announced its ""Flash In"" storage migration program to help enterprises migrate to its all-flash storage platform from the platform of privately held Dell and EMC (NYSE:EMC), the companies that are going to merge this fall. As a result of this mega merger, Dell will be able to focus on the enterprise storage marketplace, an area where EMC enjoys the leadership position.IBM is playing an opportunistic game here. Many people including storage customers are anticipating that a smooth transition toward a unified company isn't something Dell and EMC will experience post merger. IBM's plan is to grab a part of the market share of Dell-EMC via its ""Flash In"" migration program. I believe this is a rare opportunity for IBM to boost its storage market share and Big Blue is heading in the right direction by targeting cloud or cognitive computing customers.Changing Storage Industry Dynamics: IBM's OpportunityDynamics in the storage industry is changing fast, creating revenue growth opportunities for big storage vendors. Let's first focus on how the storage industry dynamics are changing.Flash storage and hybrid devices are fast replacing spinning disks in datacenters.The two primary determinants of purchasing storage devices of yesteryear, speed and scalability, no longer solely influence purchasing decisions.The ability of a storage system to allow users to apply real-time analytics at speed and scale is fast becoming the third decisive factor.Role of software is assuming greater importance in the functioning of modern storage devices."
EMC Stock's Going Away... So Let's Have A Dell Credit Party,Jul.25.16,"Key Issues:Dell Inc.'s (NASDAQ:DELL) $63.5 billion proposed acquisition of EMC Corp (EMC) was announced in October 2015. The largest tech company acquisition ever is on track to close within the next 2-3 months after receiving a 98% thumbs up vote from EMC's shareholders this past Tuesday 7/19. The merged entity, to be renamed Dell Technologies, would have pro forma FYE 1/29/16 revenue of $74.0 billion, gross margin of $19.2 billion, and an operating loss of $2.9 billion.The rationale…? The deal diversifies Dell's product mix, merging its 4th place ranking and expertise with servers (14% market share) with EMC's number one position in data storage (and 24% market share). The combined company will have leading positions in servers, storage, virtualization and PCs and be well positioned in other fast growing IT segments: Digital Transformation, Software Defined Data Centers, Hybrid Cloud, Converged Infrastructure, Mobile, and Security. The merger also gives Dell control of EMC's 80% owned VMWare (NYSE:VMW). VMW is a lead player in data center virtualization and the cloud. Dell is paying EMC shareholders $24.05 per share in cash and issuing 0.111 shares of a tracking stock in VMW per share of EMC held. EMC's revenue and operating income highlights the importance of VMW within the company. In Q2'16 EMC reported $6 billion total revenue of which $1.68 billion (or 28%) was credited to VMW.Each of the merged companies has its challenges and opportunities:- Dell's core server business is facing tighter corporate IT hardware budgets affecting other parts of its hardware product line; the same applies to EMC and competitors Lenovo and Cisco; share gains at Hewlett Packard Enterprise Inc. (NYSE:HPE) are likely not sustainable since pricing for servers remains under pressure. See Denali Holding Inc. and Subsidiaries Financial Summary (Table 1) below."
Large Spread On VMware Tracker Likely To Shrink Over Time,Sep.16.16,"On September 6th, Dell (NYSE:DVMT) completed its acquisition of EMC for $24.05 in cash and .111 shares of a tracking stock based on VMware (NYSE:VMW). With 81% of VMware owned by EMC, this part of the deal was likely a big motivator for Dell's acquisition. One problem, however, was paying for it. EMC's stake in VMware was valued at $27b before the deal was announced, and Dell was already going to have to take on a significant amount of debt to finance the acquisition. One option would have been to spin out the VMware holdings, but this would have created a massive tax bill as EMC's cost base for its stake in VMW was practically nothing (and of course Dell wanted EMC!). The solution was to give EMC shareholders shares of a newly issued tracking stock which would track the underlying economic interest in VMware. This was a win-win for Dell, as it would not only gain full control of the prized VMware business, but also knock $17.5b1 off the acquisition price. For background on the deal, see WSJ's original coverage.So what is a tracking stock? Without getting into the history of tracking stocks, it may be better to just talk about the features of this one. The following is abbreviated from Dell/EMC's FAQ sheet on the tracker:'The tracking stock will be a class of common stock (""Class V"") issued by the parent company (""Denali"") of Dell and EMC. The tracking stock is intended to track the performance of a portion of Denali's post-closing economic interest in the VMware business. Denali will issue a number of shares of Class V Common Stock at the closing of the transaction such that the issued shares of Class V Common Stock will initially have a one-to-one relationship with shares of VMware common shares.'"

At the end of the closing bell on Friday, the stocks were valued at $49.08p.s., higher than the 53% interest the stocks should represent (53%*VMware share price), indeed granting a premium to EMC's shareholders. However, we will show that those instruments are disconnected with any theoretical reasons which led the issuance in the past, do not have any advantage towards the common VMware shares and, for us, do not have any substantial value. Quantitatively investigating and analyzing the offer, we advise any investors interested in the deal to avoid participating in a financial mechanism constructed by the buy side advisors to let the market take the part of Dell (and its sponsors) to pay a part of the consideration.History does not leave us the reasons which have prompted the utilization of the tracking stocks mechanism in the Dell-EMC transactionIt was the 1984, a man named Ross Perot (owner of EDS) concerned about the motivation of his employees, forced General Motors (NYSE:GM) to structure the transaction employing an ingenious financial mechanism to safeguard a social purpose. Indeed, EDS had in its shareholder structure a massive presence of its employees and Ross thought they would have been discouraged if they had exchanged the ownership of a high growth company (EDS) with a sluggish giant (GM). With the tracking stock, EDS's shareholders secured their economical interest to their high growth story."

I would like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. As a reminder, the company is also simulcasting this call at investors.delltechnologies.com. A replay of this webcast will be available at the same location. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin.Rob WilliamsThanks, Regina. Good morning and thanks for joining us. With me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Sweet; our President of Infrastructure Solutions Group, David Goulden; and joining us from Europe is our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson.We posted our third quarter press release and web deck on our website at investors.delltechnologies.com and Q3 financial results will be filed on Form 10-Q on Friday, December 9. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspectives. I would like to highlight key changes to our financial statements due to the recent merger with EMC and the announced divestitures. On September 7, we completed the EMC transaction, combining the two companies. The consolidated results of Dell Technologies fiscal third quarter includes 52 days of EMC and VMware’s results. Going forward, we will report EMC and VMware on Dell Technologies fiscal year. The standalone results of VMware will continue to be publicly reported on a calendar year end basis through December 31, 2016. Thereafter, VMware will publicly report on the basis of Dell Technologies fiscal year which starts on February 4, 2017. On October 31, we closed the Dell Software Group transaction and received approximately $2.4 billion. On November 2, we closed the Dell Services transaction and received consideration of approximately $3 billion. And on September 12, we entered into a definitive agreement to divest the Dell EMC Enterprise Content Division, or ECD, for $1.6 billion. Subject to regulatory approval, we continue to expect the transaction to close before the end of our current fiscal year.Accordingly, for Q3, the results of Dell Services, Dell Software Group and ECD were presented on a discontinued operations basis. As assets and liabilities of these businesses were reclassified into the held-for-sale asset and liability categories on the balance sheet and on the income statement, the financial results of these businesses were reclassified out of the activity from continuing operations and listed separately in the category for discontinued operations. For more information, please refer to our SEC filings.In addition, our Q3 non-GAAP operating income excludes $3.5 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are non-cash and related purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. Please note that due to the Dell go-private transaction as well as the EMC transaction, there will continue to be significant bridging items between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the next few years although the impact will decline in each subsequent quarter. Please see Slide 3 in the web deck for additional detail on the non-cash adjustment and the supplemental slides beginning on Slide 18 as well as our SEC filings for more details on our total non-GAAP adjustments. And if that’s not enough to keep track of, please note that our historical financials do not include EMC historical results. And unless otherwise specified, all growth percentages refer to fiscal year-over-year change, which is compared to Dell prior year results."
"EMC: The Merger And Its Future, Adding Shareholder Value",Jul. 7.16,"Some BackgroundBack in September, we wrote about EMC, ""Numerous Reasons to Buy EMC."" Since then a lot has happened. On October 12, 2015, EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) entered into the merger agreement with Denali and two subsidiaries of Denali in which it has offered $24.05 per share in cash plus 0.111 shares of VMware tracking stock. Activist Paul Singer of Elliott Management did have 1.86% of the outstanding shares in September with two seats on the board of directors. With Elliott Management estimating the EMC stock was worth about $40 per share when it was selling for about $24 to $25 range. And that was prior to the Denali proposed merger agreement.Figure 1. (Source: EMC Website)Some Events Since SeptemberElliott Management now has 2.15% of the outstanding shares worth over $1.1B. In addition to Mr. Elliott, The Baupost Group has joined in and owns 2.65% outstanding worth over $1.3B, and others have acquired shares including Third Point with 7 Million shares. All reported as of March 31, 2016.As part of the first Quarter Earnings Report, (4/20/16), Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and CEO said, ""We continue to make progress on our combination with Dell. Integration planning has accelerated to ensure we begin at full speed upon closing, the leadership team has been established, and we've received the vast majority of anti-trust approvals required. We expect the transaction to happen on the original terms and within the originally announced timeframe."""
EMC - Some Thoughts On Sector M&A And What Shareholders Should Do,Jul.12.16,"The short game - Do investors take a position in VMware or EMC in front of next week's earnings?Once upon a time, EMC (NYSE:EMC) was a real growth company. No, it wasn't in the horseless carriage era, but it was in the era before Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). EMC was one of the original poster children of the first Internet bubble and was one of the leading companies of the day. At the height of the craziness, the shares traded at almost $100/share before collapsing to a low of $4.57 a mere two years later. And then, the long, slow climb back to current levels interrupted by the financial crisis.And once upon a time, VMware (NYSE:VMW) was also a real growth company. As recently as 2014, VMware still grew 16% and somewhat further back in its history, it had been a hyper-growth company as desktop virtualization swept the IT businessThe days of EMC being a growth company are long since passed, the days of Dell being a growth company are also long behind it, but none of that actually matters to those investors interested in buying what will be called the Class V tracking stock because it will essentially track the value of VMware's shares and nothing else. Overall, the new arrangement will give EMC's shareholders a 53% economic interest in VMware compared to the 81% interest they currently hold.Simply put, if you are a current EMC shareholder and continue to hold your shares until the time of the merger, you will get $24.05 in cash and .111 shares of the new Class V stock that is tied to the value of VMware. At the moment, with VMware shares selling at $59, EMC shareholders will get a tracking stock that is notionally worth over $6.50/share, so they will get about $30.50 in value for shares that are currently selling for $27.51. Since it appears that there is little risk at this point that the merger between Dell and EMC will not be consummated; that seems a pretty good return for a straightforward arbitrage."
"An Attractive ""Tracking Stock"" That Is Too Overly Discounted","Oct. 15, 2016 10:40 AM ET","""Government exists to protect us from each other. Where government has gone beyond its limits is in deciding to protect us from ourselves."" - Ronald ReaganI am happy to announce I will soon launch a third SA feed called the Traders Forum. I am bringing in a good friend to help write & run this thread that will concentrate on identifying more short term opportunities than the names I write on via my own handle, the Biotech Forum and The Insiders Forum. He has 15 years experience on Wall Street and a different writing style than my own. That feed will be up soon. In the meantime, I plan to post these ideas to my real-time followers. Please feel free to provide any feedback.The Case for Purchasing DVMT (VMware Tracking Stock)DVMT is a tracking stock created from Dell's buyout of EMC. It is currently trading at a 35.6% discount to the VMware common stock (NYSE:VMW) which it is supposed to ""track"". The reasons for this deep discount are both situation and market specific. The situation specific reasons, although in some instances concerning, are likely overblown. The market specific reasons should likely abate in the coming weeks creating a trading opportunity in DVMT.DVMT (Dell Technologies Inc.) is a tracking stock created by Dell (actually its subsidiary Denali) as a means of financing its buyout of EMC. A straight forward spin-off of EMC's 81% stake in VMware would have resulted in a massive tax bill for Dell/Denali. As a result, a ""tracking"" stock was created. Each share represents an ""economic interest"" in one common share of VMW. VMware provides virtualization and cloud infrastructure solutions in the United States and abroad.As a result of the EMC purchase and the subsequent tracking stock creation, the breakdown of outstanding VMware shares is as follows:Total Shares Outstanding: approx. 423 millionOutstanding Float : 19% (approx. 81 million)Dell/Denali Shares : 28% (approx. 119 million)Tracking Stock (NYSE:DVMT): 53% (approx. 223 million)VMW currently trades at $73.06. DVMT currently trades at $47.06, or a 35.6% discount.The reasons for this very steep discount are both situation and market specific. The situation specific actuators are as follows:1. The DVMT stock (essentially) has no voting rights.2. The DVMT stock is not guaranteed to receive a dividend.3. Should Denali go bust, Denali VMW shares would go to the creditors, not the owners of the tracking stock .4. Denali can revise the DVMT ""economic interest"" definition.Even though the tracking stock has no voting power (and only 4% of the voting rights at Denali), this is typical of most stocks of this ilk and one of the reasons that tracking stocks generally trade a 10% to 15% discount to its target.Note: One thing that seems to continue to work in this market is buying attractive small & mid-cap stocks insiders are buying. The 15 stock Insiders Forum portfolio continues to deliver blistering performance. This offering was launched in late June aims to build, modify and maintain a 15 stock optimized portfolio of attractive small & mid-cap stocks insiders are currently buying across numerous industries including biotech. We just completed the initial 15 stock portfolio last week and we will continue to make modifications going forward as more attractive risk/reward opportunities present themselves.As of the market close yesterday, the portfolio as a whole is up 19.39% compared to a slight loss of .09% our benchmark the Russell 2000 has produced. Insiders obviously are still finding bargains in what I consider at least a slightly ""overbought"" market. We are still giving away two-week free trials to this new service that has delivered stellar returns to date.VMware does not presently pay a dividend so this is essentially a non-issue at this point; however, with over $8.6 billion in cash and massive free cash flow, the possibility does exist that a dividend could be in VMware's future. With that said, it is equally (or more) likely that VMW would use the money to acquire operating assets or buyback shares. Either way, a dividend would likely be small and have a relatively small impact on the tracking share's relationship with the target.Item number three is a real concern as Dell/Denali took on a massive amount of debt to acquire EMC. As a result, Denali's debt presently incurs a high yield (or junk) rating. Its debt to cash flow is approximately six. However, EMC is expected to kick off enough cash to pay down the debt at a pace that Denali anticipates an investment grade rating on its debt sometime over the next two years.There are other odd stipulations in the tracking stock verbiage, such as Denali having the ability to alter the definition of ""economic interest"". Although they are of some concern, the chances of them happening are likely remote.The market reasons for DVMT's steep discount to VMW are as follows:1. Many of the EMC shareholders who received DVMT tracking stock were not interested in holding those shares, resulting in selling pressure.2. Creating the tracking stock essentially added approximately 175% to the float. Combine this dynamic with the fact that many of the initial tracking share recipients weren't interested in keeping their shares and an environment for artificial selling pressure exists.3. There has been some artificial selling pressure on the shares of VMW as arbs have shorted the common and purchased the tracking in the hopes that the spread will narrow over time.The market dynamics should start to abate as DVMT's trading volume - since the stock came free to trade in early September - is approximately 2/3rds of the outstanding float, giving unwilling owners the chance to disgorge themselves of the tracking shares. Also, the short pressure on VMW should dry up as the shares have become difficult and expensive (nearly 5%) to borrow.Given that VMware is expected to earn $4.30 in 2016, that translates into an 11x's multiple on the tracking stock for a company that has close to $20 a share in cash, is the market leader in the extremely hot hyper-converged storage space, and executed a solid second quarter. For reasons detailed above, I would expect the spread between the DVMT and VMW to narrow over time, making DVMT the better vehicle to achieve above average returns. VMW is expected to report earnings (.80 vs .72) on October 26.Given the above, DVMT in my opinion deserves investment consideration on Monday and I plan to pick up a few shares to establish an initial position.Thank You & Happy HuntingBret JensenFounder, Biotech Forum & Insiders ForumDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in DVMT over the next 72 hours."
VMware: An Unheralded Story Of Market Dominance In IT's Hottest Area,Jul.21.16,"VMware (NYSE:VMW) reported the results of its Q2 operations on July 18, 2016. I recently wrote an article regarding VMW's outlook within the context of the just approved deal through which Dell is acquiring EMC (EMC). Most of that article was centered on the alternatives facing investors in terms of acquiring EMC with the expectation of receiving .11 shares of a VMW tracking stock. It presents a very low cost way of acquiring VMW shares at the expense of tying up some capital at zero return for the next couple of months until the merger is finalized.I commented at that point that I did not see that there were any huge benefits for VMW in the new structure. So far, as this writer is concerned, anything that the Dell relationship adds to the picture will be lagniappe. In this last conference call, CEO Pat Gelsinger said that the Dell relationship is seeing some traction and that there were a number of high profile wins in which Dell had resold VMW solutions. It is a nice straw, but straw is all it is, as the overall numbers for the quarter were just a modest beat. The case to own VMW shares ought to have very little to do with the potential benefits that the company might reap from the Dell relationship in the wake of the merger.This article will focus on the company's operating results and the upside surprise the company printed. The shares appreciated by 9% yesterday. There is more than a bit of healthy skepticism regarding the shares. No analyst raised their rating and the average rating below the midpoint of buy/hold is quite modest and less than the average, although many raised their price target modestly. There have been no upgrades since last October and that one was a real outlier in a sea of downgrades."
Vocera: It's Worse Than We Thought; Fake Tech Company Faces Impending Smackdown,Jun.17.16,"I. Introduction & Expanded ThesisIn our initial report on April 5, 2016 (the ""Initial Report""), we provided substantial evidence to support our initial fundamental claims about Vocera Communications (NYSE:VCRA) and its management team. An analyst response to the Initial Report was published on April 6, 2016, yet it is noted that they avoided responding to any core fundamental arguments. We review these initial fundamental claims in Section IX of this report.Each piece of incremental due diligence we have obtained subsequent to our Initial Report both corroborates and increases our conviction that Vocera has over 60% near-term downside (long-term price target of $0). VCRA's technology and competitive position is far worse than we thought. User complaints about VCRA's device continue to this day. These are some of the many reasons VCRA continues to report losses each and every quarter. We believe VCRA's losses will continue. The rest of the report will outline why.In Section III, our new diligence outlines why VCRA has struggled to generate profits. VCRA relies on non-proprietary off-the-shelf components to a far larger degree than any of its competitors. This system is a loosely-engineered mix of inputs are reminiscent of computer network design from the 1990s. In other words, it is akin to selling VHS in a world that has Blu-ray DVDs. VCRA has a limited ability to control costs, as it is merely an assembler that adds minimal value to its end product. This explains why margin has been so difficult to come by - and why VCRA's competitive position is so weak."
Townsquare Media - An Obvious Yet Obscure Investment,Dec. 9.16,"Townsquare Media (NYSE:TSQ) is a small media company focused on local radio and local events. The stock is trading for an exceptionally high free cash flow yield while the majority owners are investors like Oaktree Capital and Michael Dell. Because Oaktree is a private equity investor, it has all the incentives to drive the share price higher and to cash out at a reasonable valuation.Why is the stock mispriced by the market?The company was founded after the financial crisis and is the only radio IPO in U.S. equity markets in over 10 years. Therefore, I conclude that the space is overlooked and less efficient than other areas of the U.S. equity markets.Looking at the company's market cap of less than $200 million and a complicated share structure makes an investment in shares of TSQ even more unattractive for most investors.Lastly the IPO, two years ago, has clearly failed. Today's share price of $9.65 is under the IPO price of $11.In my mind, these are perfect conditions to find a mispriced investment opportunity.Business DescriptionThe company has two segments: local marketing solutions and entertainment.The local marketing segment includes all 390 radio stations and more than 325 local websites of the company. The segment makes money by airing advertisements of local and national businesses and selling digital marketing solutions to over 10,000 small and medium-sized businesses.In the entertainment segment, the company makes money by organizing around 550 live music and lifestyle events for consumers as well as selling promotion and advertising products to local and national advertisers. Most assets of the segment were acquired last year with the takeover of NAME (North American Midway Entertainment).Business QualityContrary to popular belief, content and scale are, for the most part, not ""king"" in the media space. It is, in fact, easier to find good businesses the farther one gets away from content production and the more one focuses on a specific customer."
Initial Thoughts On Nutanix,Dec. 6.16,"Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) is a recent IPO and listed on the Nasdaq on September 30, 2016. NTNX price action has been very volatile since it started trading. NTNX is an early leader in the fast-growing Hyper Converged Infrastructure (HCI) market. Gartner is bullish on this space and mentioned in the 2016 Magic Quadrant for Integrated Systems, ""Twenty percent of mission-critical applications currently deployed on three-tier IT infrastructure will transition to HCISs by 2020.""Today we will focus on the HCI market where Nutanix competes and not the Converged Infrastructure market.If we break down the three tiers in detail, these are Servers, Storage and Virtualization. NTNX's S1, page 5 mentioned the following statistics on the three-tier infrastructure:The x86 server market, which according to Gartner, is expected to be $44.9 billion in 2016.The storage systems markets, which according to IDC, is expected to be $43.7 billion in 2016.The virtualization software market, which according to Gartner, is expected to be $4.4 billion in 2016.Based on the Gartner 20% prediction, it's fair to say $16 billion of spend will likely be disrupted and at risk. This doesn't mean the HCI market will be worth $16 billion as customers would require a lower cost of ownership to transition to the new technology.Companies at risk - ServerThe server market is dominated by HP, Dell and IBM (NYSE:IBM), which own over 50% of the market. A weak server market is nothing new for these players as they all face fierce competition from the original design manufacturer (ODM) targeting hyper scale customers directly. Expect these players to closely monitor the HCI market and introduce their own solutions over time. In the case of Dell, they have an OEM relationship with NTNX.Companies at risk - StorageEMC, which recently merged with Dell to create Dell Technologies is the worldwide leader. HP, NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and IBM also feature in the top 5. Clearly, DELL, HP and IBM will see a threat from the HCI market on both their Server and Storage businesses. EMC and NTAP will be looking very carefully at the HCI market. EMC has already hedged its bets with the introduction of VxRail in Feb 2016, a direct competitor to Nutanix."
Who Will Win This $9 Billion Game Of Chicken?,Oct.25.16,"Welcome to the Chicken issue of M&A DailyOracleThe Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) tender offer for NetSuite (NYSE:N) expires on Friday, November 4. There is an $8.89 arb spread on the $109 offer. There are no regulatory or financing constraints to holders getting paid within the next two weeks. The buyer indicated that the offer will not be raised or extended. The largest unaffiliated shareholder, T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) opposes the deal.Who, if anyone, will blink? NetSuite's weak quarter make it decreasingly likely that Oracle's Larry Ellison will blink first. As for T. Rowe, they might not either. They opposed the Dell LBO and intended to vote against it (their shares were mistakenly voted for it, so perhaps they will tender to Oracle by accident). But with no available alternative to realize more value than the current deal, both NetSuite and T. Rowe holders will quickly regret it.If you are interested in game theory including the game of chicken, then I highly recommend buying and reading The Essential Herman Kahn: In Defense of Thinking. Kahn is widely misunderstood and not widely enough read. His solution to chicken? Get into the car drunk, making sure that your opponent sees you toss the empty whiskey bottle out the window. Then as soon as the car reaches speed, toss your steering wheel out the window too. It works every time, or so T. Rowe is gambling.JPThe definitive merger agreement was filed for the American Midstream (NYSE:AMID) acquisition of JP (NYSE:JPEP).MerchantsThe definitive merger agreement was filed for the Community (NYSE:CBU) acquisition of Merchants (NASDAQ:MBVT)."
AMD: A Takeover Target?,Sep. 6.16,"A major attraction of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NYSE:AMD) for a possible acquirer is the long term licence it holds to use the Intel x86 instruction set. A larger cap company could use the acquisition of AMD to assault the de facto monopolies that Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) holds in server, notebook and desktop markets. Also the stock is near its cycle lows, presenting reduced risk.Likely Acquirer An ARM Licensee Aspiring To x86This logic evokes the possibility that Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM), Broadcom Ltd. (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Oracle Corp. (NASDAQ:ORCL) may be prospective suitors. The most likely profile of any aspiring acquirer would be an ARM licensee seeking to develop into x86 processors. To establish the necessary financial perspective, Qualcomm has a market cap of $93.36 billion, Broadcom $68.47 billion, and Oracle $170.06 billion. By comparison, the market cap of AMD is just $5.97 billion.However, any takeover attempt will in likelihood need to overcome a challenge from Intel seeking to block the acquisition and contest the transferability of the x86 licence. This is probable even though Intel were defeated by AMD in court on this issue relative to the GlobalFoundries spin off, and were required to pay AMD a $1.26 billion fine as a result.The M&A legal team of a prospective acquirer will have done their due diligence on that issue prior to any bid being made, implying that the bidder believes it may be overcome. Any bid, of course, will represent a boon for shareholders if AMD's stock price spikes higher."
Micron Technology Is In Play,Jul.25.16,"Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has done a lot of shareholder unfriendly things in the past. But last Friday's filing of a poison pill ""rights offering"" takes the cake. The document bears the date of July 20, 2016. But the time stamp on the SEC's EDGAR server says it wasn't accepted by them until ""2016-07-22 17:16:12."" Why post something on Friday after the market close? Why, to lose it for publication and speculation in the weekend financial press. Predictably, Micron was rallying strongly in the Monday pre-market, and as this is written, the stock is trading at $14.16, up 7.8% on the day.What is a rights offering? There are lots of good ideas around. Here is one. Essentially, shareholders are given the right to purchase additional securities at a bargain rate once any shareholder goes over a set threshold. In classic anti-takeover scenarios, this level is typically at 20% of the outstanding shares. This particular rights offering, with a trigger of 4.9% and with its language on Section 382 of the IRS code, is styled as a rights offering to prevent a change of control that would jeopardize the company's Net Operating Loss Carryforwards.And indeed, the company does have billions of NOLs as the most recent 10-K details on page 84:"
Open Text: Creating Growth The Old-Fashioned Way - Buying It,Sep.13.16,"Open Text and the law of unintended consequencesNo, it isn't the title of some Harry Potter tale. In fact, given how fond I usually am of obscure references, this one is almost pathetically straightforward. But that in the midst of the long and weighty observations that have been made about the implications regarding the integration of EMC and Dell, one of the less obvious expectations would have to be that the need for both cash and for focus on the part of the new Dell entity could have a massive impact on the Enterprise Content Management Space (ECM).Yesterday it was announced that Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) was acquiring the ECM division of EMC/Dell - primarily Documentum. The transaction as described below, even factoring in a likely capital raise, will lead to significant positive EPS estimate revisions by most analysts. Two banks that cover the name have already raised their ratings. I have written several articles regarding the name for SA. I have liked the name before and still believe that it offers investors significant positive alpha and as far as these things go, it is somewhat less volatile than the growthier names in the enterprise IT sector.Open Text shares have been a strong performer YTD and are up 35% over that period compared to the appreciation of the IGV of 6.5%. The shares were up 9% yesterday in the wake of the announcement and also in the wake of upgrades from two covering analysts, Dundee and BMO. (Open Text is headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario, and its shares are listed both in Toronto and on Nasdaq and it reports in USD and follows US GAAP in its earnings presentation. As a result of its Canadian headquarters, it is followed disproportionately by Canadian origin brokerages. It has adequate coverage from American brokerages as well.)"
A Closer Look At SunPower,Sep.29.16,"In December 2015, the conference in Paris created a historic moment when 195 countries came to an agreement on climate change. All of the countries agreed to lower their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to help stave off the most drastic effects of climate change. Then, in the middle of December 2015, Congress extended the ITC and solar stocks soared. Now US solar customers are not in a hurry to take advantage of the ITC. Especially Chinese solar companies that seem to have forgotten about the 2012 oversupply and have aggressively expanded their production capacity, thus creating another oversupply. So now investor enthusiasm about the ITC extension has waned, and investors are concerned about the industry challenges. So, most solar stocks are down more than 50% compared to last December and SunPower Corporation's (NASDAQ:SPWR) stock is leading the decline and is down almost 75%. SunPower's power plant business is facing challenges and recently the company has lowered its full-year guidance.There are some short-term industry concerns, but solar is here to stay and the long-term global solar demand is strong. SunPower is a well-managed company. So, we believe it is worth considering for the long term.Industry ChallengesIn the last few years, Chinese players have been aggressively expanding their production capacity. So, there are concerns about a supply glut forming and right now that is the biggest concern facing the industry. If there is an oversupply, the price will fall further and margins will decline. Many Chinese players are also expecting lower ASP in the second half of 2016. During the price decline, customers might be delaying the purchase to take advantage of the falling prices. Declining module prices will also have an impact on the project pricing. Recently, SunPower has sold power plant projects without any profit. Although the company has blamed that on other challenges facing the power plant project business, the declining module prices might have also contributed to it. A few years ago, the industry faced a very brutal oversupply situation. However, this time the demand is much stronger and the lower prices will likely increase the demand further. In addition, recently some of the Chinese players such as Canadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) and JA Solar (NASDAQ:JASO) have mentioned that they are putting a break on their production capacity. Even First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) has decided to cut the production and improve its profitability. Eventually, the oversupply situation will force out some of the weaker players, lead to industry consolidation, and will create a better environment for the stronger players. SunPower is one of the stronger companies in the industry."
VMware: Why Owning EMC May Be A Better Strategy,Jul.19.16,"Some BackgroundWe wrote an article back in September of 2015, Numerous Reasons to Buy EMC, and this July we wrote another article, EMC: The Merger and Its Future, Adding Shareholder Value. Based on some of the comments that were generated, we thought it would be useful for our readers to provide some insight regarding VMware (NYSE:VMW). Back on October 12, 2015, when the merger agreement was announced that Dell would acquire EMC (NYSE:EMC), which VMW is a subsidiary of, VMW opened at $73.90 and closed at $72.27. The following day VMW opened at $70.86 and closed at $69.31. Needless to say, the market was not enthusiastic about the merger from the VMW perspective. Even today, one could say that the deal has placed a damper on VMW with its price around $61.09.What is VMW to the Merger?VMW is what most would refer to as the crown jewel of the merger. In general, VMW brings its cloud and virtualization software and services to a growing market. In short, it takes the physical aspects of the enterprise servers located at data centers and allows them to be configured virtually. By doing so, it allows customers efficiencies and capabilities that are just not possible under the old restricted physical scheme. It is in a couple of words a ""game changer."" As way of some examples, it reduces the footprint of the data center, meaning less enterprise servers and thus lower costs. With less servers, you save on the amount of power needed and thus, less costs. Plus, a room of servers generates a very large amount of heat that then needs to be cooled to prevent the servers from overheating and reducing their life cycles. IT administrators can easily configure the servers based on demand driven capacity and virtualization offers many features that increase the server's uptime compared to the physical scheme. By Dell buying EMC, it gets both VMW plus EMC at a discount. If you look at it from one standpoint, rather than buying VMW at say $74 or even $61 per share, you can buy both VMW and EMC for only $24 or $25 per share when we first recommended EMC as a buy back in September of 2015."

Nvidia's Strategy For Desktop And Mobile Markets,Jun. 9.16,"During the last days, lots of rumors and information about Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) consumer strategy have been released on the web. In particular, there are news about the high/enthusiast end and the low end of the desktop consumer market and the high end of the mobile consumer market.Source: DEVIANTARTIt looks like Nvidia, as AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), wants to exploit better the market changes, betting more on the mobile market that is adsorbing the desktop solutions.While last month there had been a rumor stating that Nvidia would probably release the GTX 1060 (in substitution of the GTX 960) during the following fall, the idea of a market anticipation is becoming more and more real.Titan/GTX 1080 TiStarting from the enthusiast end, there are some leaked specifications (link, link) about the upcoming Titan and GTX 1080 Ti: these video cards are expected to implement the GP102 GPU, which is likely to employ a full FP32 unit series.The GPU GP102 will probably show 3840 CUDA cores (only FP32 units), providing a very massive computational power. But what has amazed me is that this chip is rumored to meet the GTX 1080 2xSLI performance, roughly 50% more than a single GTX 1080 (average performance). This means that the GP102 must be capable of more than 13 TFLOPS (FP32) of computational power, achievable if it will use the same boost clock of the GTX 1080 (1,733 MHz). This would be really astonishing, but still possible if we consider the lower complexity (lack of FP64 units), the better yields and the process refinement."

If one is interested in studying the criteria, here they are (paraphrased):Market cap > $5.3 billionAdequate liquidity and reasonable priceFor U.S. companies who file annual 10-K reports and earn at least 50% of their revenues from the United StatesListed on the major exchangesProper governance structurePublic float is at least 50%Proper sector classificationFinancial ViabilityPositive earnings for the last 12 monthsPositive earnings for the most recent quarterClean balance sheetsBefore I dive into my favorite Bullpen Stock, it is worth noting that investing in an index is not as passive as one might think. This is a fairly rigorous methodology, and is certainly shades toward financially strong companies that can generate a profit.You Should Buy VMware Inc.VMware (NYSE: VMW) is a subsidiary of Dell/EMC 2 left over from their merger which was initiated in 2015. It focuses on virtualization software, solutions and related support for IT infrastructure. One of its main products is the VMware vSphere which is the platform for the VMware vCloud Suite, as it competes in the cutthroat cloud services industry. This puts it in direct competition with tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Specifically, the company lists Software-Define Data Center, Hybrid Cloud Computing, and End-User Computing as their major product groups. Almost half of the company's revenue comes from three companies: Arrow Electronics, Tech Data Corporation, and Ingram Micro. All of their revenue stem from either licensing or services."
"Dell Technologies, The Largest Private Tech Company, Opens Its Books",Apr.28.17,"A remarkable amount of information has emerged in recent weeks about Dell Technologies (NYSE:DVMT), which rightly claims to be the world's largest privately-held technology company. The company was formed by the acquisition last September of EMC, a leading enterprise storage company, by Dell, Inc., a leading PC and server company. And Dell, in turn, was itself was taken private in 2013 in a leveraged buyout by Michael Dell, MSD Partners and Silver Lake Partners.With these transactions, two major tech players may well have passed from the public view afforded through SEC filings, earnings calls and analyst meetings. Yet circumstances arising out of the acquisition require the merged entity to file quarterly and annual results with the SEC, even as a private company. Not only has it issued a significant amount of publicly-traded debt, it is associated with two tracking stocks.Given these circumstances, we can analyze these otherwise private businesses. In recent weeks, Dell Technologies has reported its fourth quarter and full-year results, filed its first 10-K, and held both its year-end earnings conference call and its first analyst meeting as a merged company. Through these events, and the fiscal third quarter earnings report and conference call, the company has shared a significant amount of information about its structure and finances. First we will review the transaction itself as it was announced and ultimately achieved. Then we will review the constituent businesses of Dell Technologies before we conclude with a review of its first full quarter as a merged entity.The TransactionAnnounced October 12th, 2015, Dell's acquisition of EMC was complicated from the start by the need to capitalize EMC's interest in its publicly traded subsidiary, VMware (NYSE:VMW). The deal was structured as follows: Each EMC share was to generate payment of $24.05 in cash and 0.111 shares of a newly created tracking stock. As part of the financing of the transaction, Dell parent Denali Holding, Inc. issued $23.250 billion in senior notes, partially funding the mezzanine needed to conclude the deal. A new class of shares (Class V) was created for the tracking stock, which was intended to track the performance of VMware. Class V shares correspond on a one-for-one basis to EMC's shares in VMware."

Good morning and thanks for joining us. With me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Sweet; our President of Infrastructure Solutions Group, David Goulden; and joining us from Europe is our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson.On this call, we will focus primarily on Q4 results. We will provide more details on our strategy, integration efforts and capital structure at our Investor Meeting on April 5. For more details, please see the Events section of our Web-site at investors.delltechnologies.com.We posted our fourth quarter press release and Web-deck on our Web-site and Q4 results will be filed on Form 10-K tomorrow. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective. In addition, fiscal 2017 had an extra week, which was incorporated into the Company's Q4 resultsNow I would like to highlight key changes to our financial statements due to the EMC merger and the announced divestitures. As mentioned last quarter, we are reporting EMC and VMware on the Dell Technologies fiscal year. VMware Inc. has now transitioned and will report their standalone financial results on the basis of Dell Technologies fiscal year, which started on February 4, 2017 and will end on February 2, 2018. Operationally, this transition will help align our combined financial goals and go-to-market approach.Due to the recent divestitures of Dell Services, Dell Software Group and the Dell EMC Enterprise Content Division, these businesses were reported as discontinued operations in Q4 results. In prior quarters, all assets and liabilities of these businesses were reclassified into the held-for-sale asset and liability categories on the balance sheet. On the income statement, the financial results of these businesses were reclassified out of the activity from continuing operations and listed separately in the category for discontinued operations. For more information, please refer to our SEC filings.Our Q4 non-GAAP operating income excludes approximately $3.5 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are non-cash and relate to purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. Please note that due to the EMC merger and to a lesser extent the Dell go-private transaction, there will continue to be significant bridging items between our GAAP and our non-GAAP results for the next few years, although the impact will decline in each subsequent quarter. Please refer to Slide 3 in the Web-deck for additional detail on the non-cash adjustments and the supplemental slides beginning on Slide 17, as well as our SEC filings for more details on our non-GAAP adjustments."

The Motorcycle's Place In Globalization,"Mar. 7, 2017 12:38 PM ET","Financial, regulatory, and economic issues all dynamically relate. Sometimes the flows of information can have different implications: for example, discussion on globalization does not tend to cite poor financial advice that pours across online borders, or the struggles of companies such as Dell computers that have outsourced Indian call centers. While there are unfortunate or objectionable issues, several can be peripheral to a hot topic.There is an ongoing matter that few seem to be taking on amid a near-chorus of academics in support of free trade. Talk is of a 100% tariff on European small motorcycles, meaning with engine sizes from 51 to 500cc. If you are not familiar with the actual product, something 50cc is probably a scooter or moped; a highly-fuel efficient means of transport that could be fun to own, and is easy to park, but can be unsafe in all but sunny weather. A 500cc engine goes in a motorcycle for most intents and purposes; it might cost under $100 per year to insure and obtain 50 miles per gallon, although its acceleration could be insufficient if a passenger is aboard.Specific Two-Wheeled VehiclesThe $8,999 Piaggio (OTCPK:PIAGF) MP3 500 Business ABS shown below might not be applicable because it has three wheels, but the $6,399 price of the BV 350 ABS would increase:According to the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA), other affected manufacturers include Aprilia, Beta, BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY), Ducati (OTCPK:AUDVF), Fantic, Gas Gas, Husqvarna, KTM, Montesa, Scorpa, Sherco, TM and Vespa. Scorpa is a French company. Gas Gas is Spanish. Sherco is French and Spanish. Husqvarna is German. Montesa is a Spanish subsidiary of Honda (NYSE:HMC)."

Comparing Dell And HP’s Cases,"Aug. 30, 2017 11:59 AM ET","Why is Dell’s Return on Sales more than double that of HP? Because of its strategic choices about R&D and SG&A.Dell’s ROS (Return on Sales) at 6.39% is more than double that of HP at 2.77%.This is not because Dell is charging customers a higher markup over its cost of goods sold. Dell’s COGS/sales ratio is higher than HP’s in fact. This suggests that Dell is pricing its products aggressively- that is, they are not being cheap.However, Dell spends far less on SG&A expenses and on R&D than its rival, HP. This reflects Dell’s choices about where it is spending its money and about its strategies.Because Dell sells direct, it does not have a big sales forces; hence its SG&A expenses are much lower than HP’s. In addition, Dell has decided not to spend heavily on R&D primarily because it sees itself as being a commodity business. In Dell’s view, R&D is something that its suppliers, such as Intel and Microsoft undertake.Why the difference in the Return on Invested Capital?Now let’s have a look at the difference in capital turnover (or return on invested capital). Here, the difference is striking. Dell generates $12.07 of sales for every dollar of capital invested. However, HP makes just $2.14 of sales for every dollar invested. This difference drives most of the difference in ROIC.Why is Dell so much more efficient than HP in Return on invested capital? There are two reasons:1) Dell undertakes only final assembly with everything else being outsourced to suppliers. Consequently, it has to invest less in property, plant and equipment (PP&E) than HP.  2) Dell is efficient at managing its inventory, which is why its working capital to sales ratio is so much lower than HP’s. This is because Dell sells direct. It can build to order, and it does not have to fill a retail channel with inventory. Moreover, it takes order information received over its website, and through telephone sales, and transmits that instantaneously to suppliers located throughout the world, who then adjust their own production schedules accordingly.Dell’s Overall Strategy is reflected in inventoryDell coordinates the entire process so that parts arrive at Dell’s factories just when they are required and not before. There they are quickly assembled into machines and then shipped out. As a result, Dell turns over its inventory much more rapidly than HP does – 88.81 times a year in 2005, compared to just 9.5 times a year at HP.Comparison of Working Capital NeedsDell’s working capital requirements are reduced even further because many of its customers pay by credit card, and those cards are charged when a machine leaves Dell’s factory, which is long before Dell has to pay its suppliers, enabling Dell to use this money to finance its day-to-day operations. In contrast, due to its lower inventory turnover, HP probably has to pay its suppliers before it receives money from the sale of machines, which raises the companys’ need for working capital.Despite all these differences resulting in profitability, why is HP’s stock price outperforming Dell? Because of its business integrated services. This predicts that HP’s ROIC will eventually expand while Dell’s ROIC will contract.Despite Dell’s superior profitability, in 2005 and 2006, HP’s stock price outperformed that of Dell. The reason: Dell’s profit growth stalled in 2005 and 2006., whereas HP’s was accelerating, suggesting that down the road, Dell’s ROIC will contract while HP’s will expand. HP was gaining ground on Dell because it could offer business integrated services, which went beyond supplying computer hardware, to embrace designing and installing entire corporate information systems, including software."
