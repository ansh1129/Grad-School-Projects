How Healthy Is Hewlett-Packard's Financial Condition?,Apr. 9.13,"Before selecting a stock, there are a number of things that you need to consider in order to ensure that you are buying the stock of a high-quality company whose shares are poised to grow in value over time. Some of these concerns include what the company does, its competitive advantages, valuation, dividend payouts and sustainability, and earnings consistency.Another important thing that you need to consider is the financial condition of the company in question. You want to know if the company is able to continue paying its bills, and how much debt it carries. The balance sheet is one of the most effective tools that you can use to evaluate a company's financial condition. In this article, I will discuss the balance sheet of Hewlett-Packard HPQ, in order to get some clues as to how well this company is doing.I will go through the balance sheet, reviewing the most important items, in order to assess Hewlett-Packard's financial condition. The information that I am using for this article comes from HP's website here. Note that this article is not a comprehensive review as to whether Hewlett-Packard should be bought or sold, but rather, just an important piece of the puzzle when doing the proper due diligence.This article might be a bit too basic for some and too long-winded for others, but I hope that some of you can derive benefit from it.BackgroundHewlett-Packard is a leading global provider of products, technologies, software, solutions, and services to consumers, as well as businesses of all sizes. They also serve the government, healthcare, and education sectors. HP's business is divided into seven segments. They are Personal Systems, Printing, Enterprise Group, Enterprise Services, Software, HP Financial Services, and Corporate Investments.The company's Personal Systems segment accounts for 29% of HP's revenue. This segment offers commercial and personal PCs, workstations, calculators, software, and support for consumers and businesses. The Printing segment is responsible for approximately 20% of the company's revenue and offers printer hardware, inkjet printers, LaserJet printers, supplies, media, printer software, and scanning devices. The Enterprise Group segment accounts for 17% of Hewlett-Packard's revenue and includes servers, storage, networking, and technological services. The Enterprise Services segment contributes 28% of the company's revenue and offers technology consulting, outsourcing, and support across infrastructure, applications, and business process domains. The Software segment accounts for 3% of revenue and includes IT management, information management, and security solutions for businesses of all sizes. HP Financial Services offers leasing, financing, and financial asset management services for large enterprise customers. Corporate Investments include numerous business incubation projects of the company, and accounts for less than 1% of sales."
Hewlett-Packard Company: Ratio Analysis,Mar. 4.13,"I have been investigating some large cap tech stocks and I am going to discuss those that offer a good return on investment for a value investor. My analysis here is based on the ratios in the financial statements of the Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) over the last 5 years.The HP earnings report came out less than two weeks ago in what was a big week for large cap tech earnings releases with an earnings report announcement from Dell Inc. (NASDAQ:DELL) as well.These are the two long time darlings of the PC business and they went at it for as long as 12 years. Sadly, they both caught up late to the wave of the future - tablets and smart phones. And this has affected bottom lines. Nonetheless, HP has won the battle for now with Meg Whitman coming out on top during the earnings call as opposed to the lackluster performance by Dell management during their earnings call.The truth was that Whitman had the numbers to back her up as opposed to the declining revenues (down 8% year over year) and 19% drop in non-GAAP earnings over the year that Dell had. For HP, its revenues of $28.4B and diluted per share earnings of $0.82 (non-GAAP) beat analyst expectations and HP stock soared 12%.Price Action:Source: DailyFinanceHP stock is on a rebound now after it underperformed the S&P 500 in 2012; as you can see from the chart above it is well over the 100-day MA (moving average) of $15ish. The stock was hovering at a 9-year low after Whitman's speech at the firm's analyst day in October. The stock price declined from $17.13 to $15.94 and at this point I rightly picked it as a bargain stock despite the fact that HP has been on a long-term down trend.Ratios:Price RatiosYearBook ValueGrowthTangible Book ValueGrowthP/BP/E2012 Q4$11.950.25%-$6.118.67%1.39N/A2012 Q3$11.61-28.47%-$6.69-1.36%1.06N/A2012 Q2$16.23-23.04%-$6.6016.98%0.967.672012 Q1$21.095.71%-$7.955.92%1.278.292011$19.955.17%-$8.45-351.87%1.318.022010$18.977.05%-$1.87-206.56%2.4111.582009$17.727.79%-$0.61-6000%3.0516.702008$16.446.93%-$0.0199.5%2.3211.33"
Hewlett-Packard Reports Solid Earnings But Issues Still Remain,May.23.13,"Reporting earnings yesterday, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) beat consensus by $0.06, although year-over-year net revenues fell by 10%. This beating of EPS was ""driven by better-than-expected performance in the enterprise services and printing departments."" Although this was the case, revenues for all major business segments decreased compared to the same period last year. These segments include personal systems, enterprise group, software, HP financial services, and the already mentioned printing and enterprise services.The biggest decline in revenue was a 20% decrease in the personal systems segment where demand for Windows PCs has continued to decrease as a result of the expansion of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) market share. This has forced HP to move away from Windows product to the point where CEO Meg Whitman gives lip service to all non-Windows products. Below you can see the how revenues are distributed in the personal systems segment and how they have been declining every quarter. Notebooks have the biggest percentage of revenues and these are mostly non-Windows products, such as the Chromebook and the Slate 7.Desktop revenues are down 19% and units sold are also down 18% year over year. This is a major factor to consider when explaining the net revenue decrease from one year to another. Another business segment that took a tumble this quarter for Hewlett-Packard was printing which had -12% year-over-year revenues.One key statistic that interested us is the 23% year-over-year decrease in long term debt. Although to the naked eye this might look positive, we believe that a company in the position that HP is currently in should keep debt steady or actually increase it. This signifies that investments are being made to move away from their current products that are not doing too well as can be seen with the decrease in revenues in all business segments. One positive that we did see from this quarters' earnings was the great increase in cash flow from operations when comparing to one year ago. Yet some of this decrease comes from less debt payments."
Meg Whitman Owns HP Now,Apr. 5.13,"If you buy the company known as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) today, you're getting yourself a Whitman sampler.Meg Whitman may or may not be a great turnaround CEO, but she's a great corporate infighter, and now the Queen of all she surveys. That much was made clear yesterday as Ray Lane, the former Oracle president who had been chairman of her board, resigned from that position.The reason given was shareholders' anger over the acquisition of Autonomy by then-CEO Leo Apotheker. That decision was approved by the HP board. Meg Whitman was on that HP board.But somehow she skates from that decision, as she has managed to deflect blame for the company's troubles on others throughout her tenure as CEO.Since Whitman became CEO in September 2011, HP stock has gone both up and down. But it's actually little changed from where it was when she started. The company has not grown at all, and gone through almost $15 billion in losses, many of them blamed on past acquisitions. The last quarter, ending in January, saw 4% of revenue flow through to the bottom line.Whitman has no new exciting products on offer, just a statement of intent regarding cloud computing that could have been written by a telecom company, and which matches those companies' strategies. The PC niche continues to circle the drain, there is no HP phone, the HP tablets are not competitive, printers are dying.But she promises great things to come in two or three years.What Whitman has succeeded in doing is stopping the rot. The company is no worse off now than it was a year and a half ago. The only shareholder gain I can see, assuming you're happy with a 2.37% dividend that the last quarter's earnings could barely pay, would be a sale to a larger, more stable operator. IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) could both afford to make a run at HP right now.So, for that matter, could Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which is worth more than five times what HP is, be interested? That would be interesting.Of course, Microsoft is just as lacking in vision as HP is. But at least HP shareholders would have a better currency to throw around, and they'd be rid of Whitman. By buying HP, Microsoft would more than double its sales, it would gain control of what's left of its ecosystem, and it might get a second look from the market."
"If You Invested $10,000 5 Years Ago ...","Apr. 18, 2013 10:16 AM ET","The Dow 30 is often thought of as a collection of the most stable blue-chip companies in the world. As such, they tend to be the companies most widely invested in by investors who are in it for the long haul.I am a firm believer in carefully examining a company's past performance, in order to see how they have created value for their shareholders in the past, both in increased share price and increased dividend payouts over time. Particularly, I am interested in how companies have ""weathered the storm"" during the tough times.I think we can all agree that the past six years (since late 2007) have been a pretty rough time to be an investor in stocks. In examining the Dow components, I got to thinking how investors who bought and held some of these companies through the tough times made out. So, I back tested all 30 stocks, assuming an investment of $10,000 made exactly five years ago. I also assumed that all dividends were reinvested in additional shares. Some of the results are to be expected, and some were downright surprising. Here are the results, in order, and then some comments on the list:(Click to enlarge)As you can see, there is a huge difference between the high performers and low performers. One interesting note is that all but the lowest 8 are worth more now than they were in late 2007.So what do we do now? One thing not to do now is assume that the laggards are ""cheap"", simply because they are less expensive than they were five years ago. Take Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) for instance. It isn't cheap, it's diluted. General Electric (NYSE:GE) had its hands in subprime mortgages, so a lot of the value it had five years ago wasn't real.However, there are some bargains to be had. Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) is in the middle of re-inventing itself. If it can start producing innovative new products the way it used to, HP is a real bargain at these levels. The company has said it plans to turn itself around by 2014. Plus, you get paid a 3.67% dividend in the meantime, just for waiting."
BlackBerry Vs. Apple: Which Is A Winning Bet For 2013?,Mar.30.13,"IntroductionIn an earlier article we discussed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ), BlackBerry (BBRY), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Looking at the market fundamentals and base expectations on future investments of these companies, we concluded that Apple was the best bet. However, some investors commented the article strongly believed that BlackBerry would be an absolute winner in the Apple vs. BlackBerry war. In this article, I would like to make a fair suggestion on this point and to pick a winner in the Apple vs. BlackBerry war. Will Apple regain its lost glory?Deep Finance ExpertiseBefore reaching any conclusion, let's analyze key statistics for each company. Here I'm going to use the stock valuation model to find out which is the best bet. The stock valuation model rates stocks from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best using a system of advanced mathematics to determine a stock's expected risk and return. I am using different fundamental and technical factors in order to rank a stock.Indicators for ValuationAppleBlackBerryEnterprise Value393.94B5.59BP/E10.0N/APEG Ratio0.55N/APrice/Sales2.630.62Price/Book3.410.82Enterprise Value/Revenue2.390.44Enterprise Value/EBITDA6.653.60Dividend Yield (%)2.34N/ABeta1.041.641 Month Stock Returns (%)2.4613.13Year to Date Stock Returns (%)-12.7025.611 Year Stock Returns (%)-21.369.153 Year Stock Returns (%)105.3-80.2352-Week Change (%)-22.506.20S&P500 52-Week Change (%)11.4411.4452-Week High705.0718.3252-Week Low419.006.2250-Day Moving Average448.6714.46200-Day Moving Average546.8811.36ROE (%)38.41-8.67ROA (%)24.94-6.35Data from Morningstar and Financial Visualizations on March 28, 2013The most important thing to look for before buying any stock is its ""Intrinsic value"". AAPL has an intrinsic value of $724 per share. Therefore, it is undervalued compared to its price of about $442 per share, giving an upside potential of more than 60%. However at the same time, BBRY has an intrinsic value of $15.28 per share. Therefore, it is fairly valued compared to its price of about $14.4 per share."
"Dude, You're Not Getting DELL...Or AUTO",Mar.18.13,"(At Least Not At These Prices)Despite differences in scale and profile, two recently announced deals, Dell Inc. (NASDAQ:DELL) and AutoInfo, Inc. (OTC:AUTO), have something in common; they are both bold attempts to transfer value from current shareholders to management-led buyout groups. These are not takeunders in the traditional sense, in that they are not priced at a discount to the market price; however, they are priced well below the target's standalone intrinsic value. Both offers require significant bumps in price in order to avoid massive, voluntary wealth transfers away from current shareholders.The leveraged buyout of DELL was priced at $13.65, which is substantially less than what DELL is worth. Potential bidders such as Blackstone Group LP (NYSE:BX), Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE:HPQ) and Lenovo Group Ltd. were not given an opportunity to bid on DELL at the same time as the buyout group. Concerns of shareholders such as Southeastern Asset Management Inc., T. Rowe Price Group Inc., and Carl Icahn were ignored. The buyout group believes that they can make a multiple of their money by simply leveraging up DELL's balance sheet. But of course DELL could do that on behalf of their own shareholders. They do not need to transfer the equity in order to enrich the equity holders."
Why I Like Intel And Other Stocks In The Semiconductor SOX Index,"Jan. 28, 2013 2:19 PM ET","While many investors prefer trading indexes and ETFs to avoid specific stock risk, many of us at Seeking Alpha are here with ideas on how to beat the indexes. One method I use is to follow the indexes, such as MY ARTICLES ABOUT SPY for the S&P500 index, then pick favorite stocks from the indexes when they are out of favor after correcting down to major support levels. As someone who designed semiconductors for 20 years with an ""engineer/scientist"" title in Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) R&D department, plus schooling and some work in process design, I like to trade the Semiconductor Index represented by the iShares Semiconductor exchange traded fund (NASDAQ:SOXX), as it is an area where I have experience that most financial analysts lack.The SOX index is on the verge of a technical breakout (see the dashed red line in the graph below). This could be a very bullish sign if we see high volume with rising prices. Currently, of the stocks I own in the SOX, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is the closest in price to the last time I added shares.As of January 24, 2013 according to ishares.com, the 10 largest components of the Semiconductor Index are Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Intel, Broadcom (BRCM), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Sandisk (SNDK), NXP Semiconductor (NASDAQ:NXPI), KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC) and Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX).

The Cyclical And Secular Risks Of The PC Industry,"Jan. 8, 2013 6:13 PM ET","The PC industry is affected by both cyclical trends and secular shifts. Affects on the PC industry funnels though all sub-sectors of the PC industry, including PC manufacturers like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), semiconductors like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advance Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and hard-drive makers like Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NYSE:WDC). This article will look at the cyclical risks (average 3-4 years PC replacement cycle, product upgrade cycles) and secular risks (mobile smartphones and tablets replacing desktops) of investing in the PC industry, and its affects on the various companies within its sub-sectors.Cyclical versus secularWhat does cyclical and secular mean exactly? Broadly speaking, just remember cyclical means short-term and secular means long-term. Keep in mind that you can have both cyclical and secular trends co-exist within an industry.Cyclical means that the industry's growth will go through peaks and troughs. Each growing or declining phase is short-term, because eventually the other side of the equation will come around. For example, industrial or commodity-related industries are high cyclical industries, because they are heavily tied to overall spurts and slowdowns of the economy. Also, think about durable goods such as automobiles, TVs, and desktops/laptops (versus non-durable goods such as food, health and beauty, cleaning products, etc.). Durable goods are typically cyclical, because they have long replacement life cycles (average lives of cars 8-9 years, TVs 6-7 years, computers 3-4 years). If there was a big spike in demand in a given year (peak), then it would take multiple years of slower growth in-between (trough), before the buyers from year one bought replacement products (peak). Non-durable goods companies, such as Proctor and Gamble (NYSE:PG) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), typically are not cyclical because their products have short-shelf life and require you to make purchases regularly (well, besides commodities where you can have significant seasonal and cyclical spikes)."
Why Apple Will Repeat History And Plunge Into The Abyss: Time To Call It Quits,May.28.13,"I know, I will not make any friends writing something negative about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), especially with that headline. It sounds dramatic to say the least and I am starting already to hear you say that a giant such as Apple, which is one of the best money machines in American history, can't go bankrupt no matter how much times the prolific company experiences rough times.After all, everybody likes Apple for its awesome products. In fact, we share a strong emotion towards this success story, how it changed our lives with its revolutionary products and so on. However, after a remarkable beginning, Apple hasn't been very good until Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1996 to save the company from bankruptcy. Yes, bankruptcy.(Click to enlarge)Source: EcchFirst, I will go back in time and make a recap of Apple history. By doing this exercise, the readers will have a better understanding of how the Apple empire has been built and why it will fall ... again. Then, I will discuss the company's recent financial results and what makes Apple so special. Then, I will explain the reasons from which I believe Apple will decline in the next few years, doomed by its past success.The Beginnings Of A New EraThe Fathers of Apple, Steven Wozniak and Steven Jobs were friends, back from their high school days. They were both interested in electronics and kept in touch after graduation. Then, dropping out of school from Reed College and UC Berkeley, respectively by 1975, they got a job in the electronics field. Wozniak got a job for Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) while Jobs ended up working for Atari.Wozniak's Apple I Circuit-Board"
What's All The Ruckus About Ruckus Wireless?,Feb.18.13,"Ruckus Wireless (NYSE:RKUS) went public at $15/share on November 15th last year, only to drop 18% to $12.25 when the closing bell rang that very same day. That was then. Earlier this week, it crossed the tape at $26.50 after a dizzying ride to the upside, only to come crashing down to $19 at the market close on Friday. The equity sold off because of some cautionary comments by CEO Selina Lo during Tuesday's Q4 conference call.There is a lot of impulse buying when IPO's hit the tape, and Ruckus Wireless is no exception. Investors get an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a company with disruptive technology, and the stock usually runs. With the stock at $26.50, and a forward P/E Ratio of 147, Ruckus just got ahead of itself. The security is currently in correction mode.It should be noted that in mid January, market pundit Jim Cramer showcased the company on his television program Mad Money, but cautioned that the stock was expensive at $21/share. His endorsement may have moved the equity despite his warning. A brief business description is provided by Seeking Alpha Editor Miriam Metzinger in her Mad Money recap:Ruckus Wireless is revolutionizing wifi, and is making interference-resistant systems and antennae to ensure there is no interruption in Wi-Fi service. The company has strong exposure to the enterprise space, and allows companies to install fewer Wi-Fi points, because the signal is so effective.Although Ruckus Wireless has more than 21,700 enterprise clients worldwide, the company is credited with developing the industry's first adaptive Wi-Fi solution for service providers. Some of their large telecom clients include Time Warner Cable (TWC), Towerstream (OTCQB:TWER), British Sky Broadcasting (BSYBY), Japan's KDDI, Axtel, Oi, and Global Reach. A highly diversified and global business, Ruckus operates research and development centers in Sunnyvale, California; Shenzen, China; Bangalore, India; Tel Aviv, Israel; and Taipei, Taiwan.Because of the innovation from their R&D department in regards to the telecom carriers, Ruckus may have leapfrogged over competitors Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HP), and Aruba Networks (NASDAQ:ARUN). These advances in technology can have a short shelf life, especially with the deep pockets of Ruckus rivals. It is no coincidence that Cisco acquired networking company Meraki two days after the Ruckus IPO."
Are Kiplinger's Top 25 Funds Any Better Than A Comparable ETF? Large-Cap Edition (Part 2),"Apr. 24, 2013 10:32 AM ET","This month, Kiplinger provided their annual list of Kiplinger's 25. I wanted to do a comparison of those funds with either their benchmark ETFs or ETFs in similar families (i.e., large-cap value). Comparisons include:Performance over one, three, five, and 10 years (when available)P/E and P/BVTop 10 Holdings and their percentage of holdingsHistorical theoretical growth of $10,000 over timeIn Part 1 of this series, I covered the two large-cap value funds that Kiplinger listed, Artisan Value (MUTF:ARTLX) and Vanguard Dividend Income (MUTF:VDIGX), and compared them to the iShares Russell 1000 Value (NYSEARCA:IWD) and the iShares S&P 500 Value (NYSEARCA:IVE) ETFs. Kiplinger actually categorized their five large funds into one family, comparing them to the S&P 500. However, I wanted to go a step further and therefore broke up value and blend. For this article, I would like to focus on the two large-cap blend funds listed and their comparable ETFs.Large-Cap Blend FundsDodge & Cox Stock (MUTF:DODGX) has a goal of long-term growth as well as income, with a secondary objective of achieving reasonable current income. Their strategy is to be fairly diversified while choosing undervalued individual stocks that have long-term room for growth. As of March 31, 2013, the fund's top 10 holdings include Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HP), Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC), Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Sanofi (NYSE:SNY), Time Warner, Inc. (TWC), Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK), Sprint Nextel (NYSE:S), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).Fidelity Contrafund (MUTF:FCNTX) seeks capital appreciation by investing in both growth and value funds. The fund is typically around 85%-90% domestic. This fund's top 10 holdings include Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple AAPL), Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A), Wells Fargo, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Disney (NYSE:DIS), Noble Energy (NYSE:NE), Visa (NYSE:V), Biogen Idec (NASDAQ:BIIB), and TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX).Mairs And Power Growth Fund (MUTF:MPGFX) is the final large cap fund listed in Kiplinger's Top 25. This smaller fund ($3 billion in holdings vs. $43 billion and $63 billion, respectively, for Dodge & Cox Stock and Fidelity Contrafund) is based in the Midwest and although location is not the only determining factor, Mairs and Power prefer to stick to what they know. Their top 10 holdings have an upper Midwest feel to them with several of the companies headquartered there or that have a large operational presence there. The top 10 holdings are Valspar (VAL), 3M (NYSE:MMM), Target (NYSE:TGT), Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR), Honeywell International (NYSE:HON), Pentair Ltd. (NYSE:PNR), Ecolab (NYSE:ECL), H.B. Fuller (NYSE:FUL), and Toro (NYSE:TTC)."
Monotype Imaging Looks To Print Money,Mar.14.13,"Fonts and typefaces fall into that group of technologies that nobody thinks about unless/until they fail or don't look right. Monotype Imaging (NASDAQ:TYPE) makes sure that doesn't happen often, as it is a leading developer of text imaging software and solutions. Although the shares look reasonably valued today, more success in emerging end-market opportunities could lead to better-than-expected performance down the line.Legibility Is UnderratedOEMs use Monotype's technology in consumer products like printers, mobile handsets, and automobiles. These fonts are embedded in products like laser printers or phones and allow the devices to present clear, easy-to-read text in a variety of fonts. Monotype owns or licenses more than 13,000 typefaces, and as these are trademarked (not patented), Monotype effectively has a moat around them indefinitely.It's not just Monotype's library of typefaces that makes it an interesting OEM partner. The company's scaling technology produces real storage savings in comparison to storage-intensive bitmaps, and that's a key advantage for OEMs. It's also worth noting that scaling isn't as simple as it might sound - scaling Roman letters isn't that complicated, but compressing non-Western scripts like Chinese or Sanskrit without losing legibility is another matter.Moving From Printers To New DevicesSix years ago, Monotype generated about 70% of its revenue from printer OEMs like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Lexmark (NYSE:LXK), and Canon (NYSE:CAJ). In the intervening years, there have been some hard times for the major printer manufacturers. Even so, I think investors may not realize that overall printer shipments haven't evaporated - a number of other printer manufacturers (most of them located in Asia) have increased their unit share, and given that Monotype's royalties are unit-based, that's kept the business in relatively good shape.All told, the printer market is probably worth about $200 million or so today, with Monotype holding about 30% share. While there are ongoing opportunities from products like page description language (PDL) and print drivers, there will be competition from companies like Software Imaging and regional specialists (companies focused on fonts/typefaces for particular languages or language groups). Though some analysts believe this could still be a high single-digit growth market (and Monotype hasn't historically seen much price pressure), I'm more inclined to assume a lower growth outlook in the low-to-mid single digits."
A Different Way Of Looking At Microsoft's Valuation,Feb.11.13,"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was one of the worst performing tech stocks in 2012. Its stock was down 21 bps in 2012, and on a dividend adjusted basis, was only up 262 bps. The strength of this company lies in its diverse product lines. It supports five operating segments and a corporate segment. These segments should be valued separately, especially with all of the recent talks about company break-ups. This is not to say that MSFT should break up into separate parts, but is a way for investors to see what each segment is really worth to MSFT. The five segments it operates in are: Windows Division, Server & Tools, Online Services, Microsoft Business, and Entertainment and Devices. One way to try to value each segment is on a P/S basis.Windows DivisionThis segment used to be one of MSFT's bread and butter. Its products consist of Windows 7's operating system, Windows Live, and PC hardware products (Source: 10-K). The segment's sales and operating profit margin (OPM) are shown below (Source: Capital IQ):MSFT competes against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in this segment. Both of these competitors have gained competitive advantages against the company, as there is a social and corporate trend away from typical MSFT operating systems. For this method, I used management's guidance and a regression analysis to forecast sales for each segment. For the multiples used, I used the average of the segment's group. GOOG was left out of this segment due to its much higher valuation, which is inconceivable for MSFT going down the road, and the higher similarity with valuation to AAPL's iOS system. The valuations are shown below (Source: Capital IQ):"
3D Printing: Improving Margins Lowers Material Costs,"Apr. 11, 2013 1:24 PM ET","Intro3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) along with its main competitor Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) currently own 13.3% of the global market share for their industry, however they're the only two major players with a concentration in the market positioned to take advantage of this booming industry.(Click to enlarge)While some see the companies trading at a premium and potential growth slowing, there is a key element I believe many investors are overlooking what could be a hidden catalyst for both companies.ThesisA common theme amongst all major players in this industry is their gross margins. Both 3D Systems, Stratasys and now ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) have all approached the 50% gross margin level, but the increase in margins seems to have slowed slightly over the last several reporting periods. The key catalysts for both companies is competition in materials. In my opinion, the introduction of new players to the market combined with the notion that no one company controls more than 10% of the global market share is actually a very positive sign and I believe it will take these stocks to the next level. Material Sales are the key. As the industry demand for printers grows, so does the demand for materials. It's no different than the dawn of the digital printers we're all familiar with. Let's face it, a company like Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) revenue from printing never made much from the device sales. The key was the ink replacement. As more and more devices came on the market that used ink-jet technology, the demand for ink grew at a much faster rate than costs as so many new competitors offered different alternatives. In my opinion, the same will happen with 3D printing. To see how this plays out, let's take a look at the current margins."
"After Interviewing More Industry Insiders, I Am Even More Bearish On ServiceNow",Jan.15.13,"In my previous article on ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), I described what I learned about the company and the IT Service Management (ITSM) industry. After interviewing industry insiders to write my first article, I interviewed more people to gain a deeper understanding of ServiceNow's situation. My latest interviews were with a former ServiceNow employee, a technology analyst for a hedge fund who says ServiceNow ""is his highest conviction short"", and Matt Selheimer, the VP of marketing for the innovative ITSM company ITinvolve. The hedge fund analyst is the only one out of the three who has a position in NOW. Thank you all for your help in giving me a better understanding of ServiceNow and the ITSM industry.Further evidence has confirmed that ServiceNow is on a downward trajectory. Its bread and butter ITSM business is falling behind in innovation and has much tougher competition than it used to, and its efforts to expand to other markets are not nearly as successful as was hoped. This should become apparent in the company's upcoming earnings call on January 30th, and in the proceeding two stock lockup period dates within the two weeks afterwards where I expect insiders to sell many shares. Savvy shareholders will not continue to hold this stock with a price/revenue multiple of 12+ and negative earnings once they realize that ServiceNow's growth is rapidly slowing down.Single Tenant Vs. Multi Tenant ArchitectureServiceNow has many problems, but the biggest one is its single tenant architecture. ServiceNow has had this same model since its beginning in 2004, and hasn't changed it. While other ITSM companies are innovating and changing their models to multi-tenant, ServiceNow is stuck in its old way of operation.""The fact is that ServiceNow has stopped innovating in the ITSM market,"" says Matt Selheimer, from ITinvolve.Think about the dollars being sucked into supporting its single tenant model that could have been used for application innovation instead. Sure, ServiceNow's product has gotten incrementally better since 2004, but it isn't innovating in the ITSM space. They really have simply been filling in product gaps relative to their longer-established peers."
Why Apple Is Still A Buy Despite Its New Industry Classification,Feb. 8.13,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), interestingly enough, suffers from a couple problems, none of which are all that bad to have. One is its new industry classification. Its $400 billion plus market cap puts it into a unique category; a 'new' industry that includes mega-cap stocks. Something strange happens when stocks hit a market-cap above say $200 billion; they stop trading in line with their industry and generally trade at depressed multiples.The other fundamental issue for Apple is its cash. A problem that a number of companies would love to have. It's such a problem that billionaire investor and hedge fund manager David Einhorn is suing the company in hopes of forcing the company to put its cash to work for shareholders. Einhorn explains Apple's inability to spend its cash as a mental issue…It has sort of a mentality of a depression. In other words, people who have gone through traumas ... and Apple has gone through a couple of traumas in its history, they sometimes feel like they can never have enough cash.It can be argued that the depreciation in the stock has resulted in part from the lack of capital returned to Apple's shareholders. Apple has over $136 billion in cash and available-for-sale securities on its balance sheet. It needs to find ways to effectively use those assets. Returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends or stock buy-backs is a good start. In lieu of dividends and stock buy-backs, Apple can also implement an aggressive acquisition strategy with all its cash. Apple can acquire technology and talent to make its competitive advantages durable in its ultra-competitive industry. Either way, shareholders need to see some tangible effects of an increasing horde of cash.Interestingly, Steve Jobs, before his passing, consulted with Warren Buffett on what to do with all of Apple's cash. Warren Buffet's reasons for investing in IBM (NYSE:IBM) can be good reasons for Apple to implement a more liberal dividend and share buyback plan. Although IBM has only grown its revenues a little over 2% per year on average for the last 10 years, its earnings per share (NYSEARCA:EPS) has grown close to 12% per year over the same time frame. The reason for the disparity is the effectiveness of IBM's financial engineering - stock buy-backs and dividends. IBM rewards its shareholders handsomely, so the shareholders stick with the company. When the stock declines, the buy-back policy effectively buys more shares and causes a larger upside for long-term shareholders when the stock normalizes. In the case of Apple, if many investors agreed that its stock was undervalued at $700, they will surely agree that it is undervalued at $500. Therefore, a buy-back program could be more advantageous than ever at this point with the drop in price of Apple's stock."
Intel: The Other Side Of The Coin,Mar.25.13,"Fellow SA contributor Ashraf Eassa recently wrote a great article on Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as a stock that could double in four years. Ashraf is a great SA contributor and much more knowledgeable within the tech sector than I am, as shown by his top rankings and substantive, in-depth articles. For Intel, Ashraf makes a compelling bull's case, including pros of Intel such as a) cheap valuation multiple, b) Intel market cap is now about the same as foundry Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and, c) potential overblown mobile concerns. I too have looked into Intel in the past few months, and most of these pros I also agree with. However, just like all coins have two sides, all stocks have pros and cons. In this article, I would like to highlight some of the potential cons of Intel, which have caused me to be a bit ""gun shy"" in picking up some shares. In the end, I still may buy some Intel shares (if pros outweigh the cons), but it's always helpful to highlight as much of all the risks before taking a new position in a stock.Competitive Industry DynamicsThe $300 billion Semiconductor industry can be broadly separated into two product categories: Integrated Circuits or IC (complex, many transistors) and Discrete or Non-IC (a few transistors). Within Integrated Circuits (which is 80% of the market), it can be further divided into: Analog, Micro-Devices, Memory and Logic.Intel competes in Micro-Devices and Logic. Micro-Devices can be further broken down into Microprocessors (MPU), Microcontroller (MCU) and Digital Signal Processor. Intel dominates within in Microprocessors, with +80% market share.While Intel may dominate within the specific segment of Microprocessors (MPU), within the context of the entire semiconductor industry, Intel is not nearly as dominant with only 16% market share."

Using Free Cash Flow To Compare Company Valuations,"Feb. 17, 2013 4:12 PM ET","Most GAAP financial statements rely on accrual accounting which includes many peculiarities such as depreciation and amortization. The reason is that it helps match income and expenses within the reporting period. For example, even though a piece of equipment might be purchased with cash, if it has a useful life of seven years, cash-based accounting would record a big hit in the quarter the equipment was purchased, while accrual accounting would depreciate it over the expected useful life. This can obscure the true ability of a business to generate cash available for owners. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP metric that can help back out some of these items to help reconcile the differences between accrual and cash-based accounting. Because it is non-GAAP, FCF is not reported on the SEC filings such as the income statement. It can be computed by taking the statement of cash flows and making some adjustments for depreciation and amortization. I have previously written on FCF in the reinsurance industry in this article.Another way of looking at FCF is that it represents the dollars available to management to deploy where most needed. It can be re-allocated back to investing in the business, to pay down debt, or to investors to fund share repurchases or dividends. More importantly, it indicates that the business itself is generating these dollars, giving the company flexibility in not having to tap the capital markets or sell off parts of its business. However, it is the ratio of price to FCF (P/FCF) that tells you how much the investor must pay for that dollar of FCF. It helps normalize it for comparison across other companies, just in the way that the more familiar price to earnings (P/E) ratio helps for comparing profits.I thought it might be a useful exercise to compare the free cash flow of five widely-held stocks of mature companies. Since most investors may not be used to comparing price to free cash flow (P/FCF), I also included the more popular price to earnings (P/E) metric, along with another of my favorite ratios, price to book value (P/B)."
An In-Depth Analysis Of Cisco Systems,Feb.10.13,"Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the world's leading provider of data networking equipments and software. Its products include switches, routers, access equipment, and network-management software that allow data communication among dispersed computer networks. The company has also entered newer markets, such as video conferencing, web-based collaboration and data center servers.IntroductionI don't believe that anyone should argue against the idea that the Internet will continue to grow for many years to come. Cisco Systems is the world's largest supplier of high performance Internet networking systems and solutions.1st Quarter PerformanceThe first quarter of Cisco's fiscal year ended on October 27, 2012. Revenue for the quarter was up 6% from the first quarter of the previous fiscal year. The company kept cost increases in check due to lower restructuring charges, and operating expenses were slightly down during the quarter. Reported earnings were up 18%. A modest decrease in share count helped bring earnings per share to $0.48 versus the estimated $0.46 per share.As expected, Asia was the biggest revenue growth center; overall growth was 10.4% outpacing North America's 6.6% while sales were down 0.1% in EMEA. The U.S. growth was impressive given that Cisco's biggest client, the U.S. Government, slowed purchases by shifting a significant proportion of Cisco's business to the private sector.Overall revenue distribution in the Q1'13:Its wireless segment contributed just 4% to revenue, but its 38% growth in the quarter from last year means that Wi-Fi will play an important role in the company's future. Cisco's service revenues posted double digit 12% growth to $2.6 billion. The company's gross margins were 66% from Service and 60% from Products. Almost 80% of Cisco's revenues come from 'Products' with 'switching' equipments, forming 30% of the total revenues."
5 Dividend Comeback Stock Picks For 2013,"Jan. 2, 2013 1:17 PM ET","This article will discuss five stocks that I believe will come back in 2013 with price increases. I also own shares of all five companies so I find these stocks suitable for my stock portfolio. There are some key general attributes that I see in these stocks that make them appealing to me. They are as follows:All five of these companies pay a dividend.All five of these companies have seen significant stock price drops over the last year and/or few years.All of these companies are very well known and are among the leaders in their respective industries.All of these companies provide substantial opportunities to generate income for an income investor based on their dividends and/or covered call choices.As an investor, my goal is to generate income via dividends, interest, and from covered calls. I recently read an article in the Wall Street Journal on Saturday/Sunday December 29-30, 2012 (THE INTELLIGENT INVESTOR by Jason Zweig) titled ""At Long Last, Could the Dividend Revolution Be Here?"" In this article, the author noted that companies in the S&P 500 will pay out regular cash dividends of $281 billion which is predicted by S&P Dow Jones Indices. This is a 17% increase from 2011 and is 13% above the previous record in 2008. To me, this solidifies the fact that dividends are the trend and companies now more than ever will pay out as much in dividends as they can. For these particular five companies highlighted here, I believe the market has priced in risks that the dividends may be cut from here on out and/or that they will continue to produce sub-par earnings. For all five of these companies, I believe that this fear is overdone, and that the stock prices have come down too far.The first company that I think will come back in 2013 is Best Buy (NYSE:BBY). As of December 28, 2012, its stock price closed at $11.29. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has been absolutely decimated, as shown in the following chart."
BlackBerry Could Be This Year's Winner,Apr.12.13,"The past couple of years have not been very good for BlackBerry (BBRY), the Canadian mobile phone and tablet maker. The company's products fell out of favor as names like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) started to dominate the space. The company's PlayBook tablet didn't gain traction and revenues started to fall off a cliff. Shares that traded for more than $140 in 2008 fell to just $6 and change in 2012.Part of the reason for the stock's fall was the launch of BlackBerry 10, which faced delay after delay. With the product launch being pushed further back, the company was forced to rely on sales of older phones that were just not competitive in the space. Well, the company finally launched those phones earlier this year, and they sold about a million of them in their fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in February.Now that the BlackBerry 10 launch has come and gone, it's time to review this name again. Today, I'll explain why I think this company is set up for a decent future, and why that means that this beaten down stock could prove to be one of this year's biggest winners.Results are finally starting to improve:As we waited and waited for BlackBerry 10 to finally launch, the company's revenues continued to fall. As you can see from the chart below, the company's revenues plunged from $5.17 billion in Q3 of fiscal 2012 (which ended in November 2011) to just $2.68 billion in the recently reported quarter. However, current estimates call for those revenues to start rising again this quarter, as BlackBerry 10 continues to gain traction and hit new markets. The current estimate for $3.34 billion in quarterly revenues would represent a 25% sequential rise in revenues. This would be BlackBerry's highest revenue quarter in over a year, and I've put that estimate in the chart here."
"Stock Buybacks: The Good, The Bad And The Ugly","Feb. 25, 2013 3:41 PM ET","IntroductionCompanies that buy back stock do so for different reasons with varying success. However there should be only one reason for companies to buy back their own shares: to create shareholder value. Like investors, companies buying back their own stock must heed the most essential axiom of investing: buy low and sell high. Unfortunately, like most investors who pathologically buy high and sell low, companies engaged in repurchasing their own stock often buy high. While they don't often sell low unless they need to raise capital, the fact that they bought high leaves them in a position where they do not have the capital to buy low.A company that is in a position to buy back its own stock because it has excess cash should desire its company's share price to decline, as it can buy back more shares at lower prices, which benefits long-term stock holders. The lower a company's stock price, the more beneficial a share repurchase program becomes relative to the company's other means of employing its excess capital. In effect, a company looking to repurchase its own stock should consider itself to be short its own shares.Yet this line of thinking contradicts the psychology of managements, who view excess capital as a reason in itself to repurchase shares. Worse, managers are often long stock options, and share repurchase programs become a means by which to unload these options at a higher price in order to make short-term profits.In this article I identify three reasons, or categories of reasons, that company's buy back their own stock: the ""good,"" the ""bad"" and the ""ugly.""1--The GoodThe only reason a company should buy back its own stock, assuming it is able to, is that its management perceives value in its shares at the price they trade at in the marketplace. Such buybacks are aimed at creating shareholder value, and as a result one often finds that the share repurchases are extremely well timed when evaluated several years later.Sturm, Ruger and Company (NYSE:RGR) is an example of this. When I was listening to its quarterly conference call a year or so ago, Michael Fifer, the CEO, said that the company will buy back stock only at valuations that are below the level at which an investor would consider buying shares on the market. While this sounds vague, the company's track record speaks for itself. Sturm, Ruger and Company bought back stock in 2008, when the company's shares traded at under $10, and again in 2010, when the company's shares traded between $10 and $20. Now that the stock is trading well over $40 (over $50 at the present time) the company is not buying back any stock. This pattern gives me enormous confidence in RGR management's ability to recognize the value of the company, and in its commitment to long-term shareholders."
Dogging The Dow: Examining The 'Dogs Of The Dow' Strategy,"Jan. 3, 2013 3:25 AM ET","I am sure that many readers are familiar with the ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy. The strategy has been in use since 1972 and has been a proven success, with an average yield of over 14% per year, compared to an average yield by the Dow overall of over 11%. The results this year aren't quite so good, with the Dogs up by 5.7%, while the Dow's 30 stocks as a whole are up 11%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.3%. The results for the Dogs are based on the ""traditional"" strategy of investing $10,000, divided equally among each of the ten Dogs. (The figures do not include dividends.) The table below shows the results for the 2012 Dogs:The success of the ""Dogs"" strategy is well established. The strategy was ""invented"" in 1972, and over 40 years it has, on average, outperformed the Dow by about 300 BPS. Even more impressive is the strategy based on the five lowest-priced Dogs (alternatively called the ""Pups of the Dow,"" the ""Small Dogs of the Dow"" or the ""Flying Five""): they have averaged better than 20% yield, or nearly 900 BPS over the Dow. This year, the Pups managed a yield of 6.7% - somewhat less than the Dow.I do have a question, however, that has been nagging at me ever since I took a close look at the Dogs of the Dow and the companies that make up the Dow 30. Given that the Dow Jones is very selective about the companies included in its group of industrial companies, how would those companies hold up to an analysis by a set of criteria intended to identify well-run companies? This would, of course, take a lot of time, so focusing on the Dogs of the Dow seemed like a reasonable starting point. I walked away from this initial encounter a little bit wiser about the ""Dogs"" strategy."
Why Price/Sales Is A Dangerous Valuation Metric,"Mar. 24, 2013 1:50 AM ET","When it comes to predicting stock prices, we all want convenient, easy-to-use metrics that will give us the answer to our question: Can I make money in this stock? Unfortunately, like many things in life, simple and quick short-cuts can lead us to the wrong conclusions. It's been a little over a year since I attempted to debunk one such valuation tool, the PEG Ratio, which I called ""silly"" (perhaps a bit too sensational!). That article, as old as it is, still gets hundreds of views a week, suggesting to me that these discussions of how to value stocks are of interest.Today, I want to tackle another popular metric, known as ""Price/Sales"" (P/S). To calculate the value, and here is the simple part, all you need to do is divide the market cap (price of stock times number of shares outstanding) by the trailing sales (typically the last four quarters). The result is always a positive number. You can apply this to an individual stock or even to the whole market. The S&P 500, for instance, currently trades at 1.4X its trailing sales. This is pretty much the middle of the road for the past two decades, with a range of 0.7 (early 2009) to 2.3 (2000).While there are many circumstances that are appropriate for using sales, like when there are no earnings, it can't be used without understanding how to use it properly. The bottom line is that you can't make money buying low P/S stocks (or shorting high P/S stocks) blindly.What's Wrong with P/S?There are three elements that are totally omitted from the analysis when one focuses solely on the P/S ratio:MarginsGrowth RatesBalance SheetThe first objection to using P/S in absolute terms is that it fails to incorporate profit margins. Basic investment theory tells us that companies are ultimately valued on their earnings or the cash flow to their shareholders over time, discounted back to the current value. If a company has really high sales but never earns a dime, it's likely to be a poor investment in the long run. Still, without sales, you can't have earnings, so sales are important to watch. There are several different layers between earnings (which fuel dividends) and sales, and one can compare these to sales by looking at various ""profit margins"":"
A Complete Financial Analysis Of Apple,Jan.24.13,"With the recent quarterly release this week, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock price plummeted down over 10% in a day. Partly due to panic among investors and partly due to negative opinion by analysts, Apple suffered a huge blowback in its market worth. But even among this, it was heard from Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York- ""You have Apple and technology on the one side and the rest of the market on the other side.""In my opinion, there's a lot more to Apple than a simple quarterly release. As Nick Summers wrote in a Businessweek article:""Even if its days of hyper growth are over, Apple remains an astonishingly profitable company.""So let's dig deeper into this.Industry AnalysisWith the release of iPhone 5 and strong ties with Verizon (US market share of 31.9%) and AT&T (US market share of 35.4%), Apple's share in the smartphone market has shown remarkable rise in the recent quarter. As per a study conducted by Kantar Worldpanel ComTech:""The iPhone accounted for 53.3 percent of smartphone purchases during the twelve week period ended November 25. That's up from just 35.8 percent a year ago. Android, on the other hand, is down to 41.9 percent from 52.8 percent a year ago.In Europe, it's not as great for Apple. It's getting pummeled by Android which has 61 percent of the market to the iPhone's 25.3 percent.""Apart from the US market, Apple is not doing so badly globally either. 61% of the total revenue (MRQ) was derived from international sales, as per the latest quarterly report. Apple's iPhone reportedly hold 5.5% share of all mobile phones in Q3FY2012. Total 428 million units were sold during that period, while smartphone sales increased by 47%."
The Weekly Dow: 5 Cheapest Price-to-Book Stocks,Apr.13.13,"This is the second edition of the weekly series called The Weekly Dow (for last week's article on the Top 5 Dividend Plays, click here). This week, we will look at the 5 cheapest Price-to-Book multiple stocks in the Dow Index Industrials Index (NYSEARCA:DIA). By the way, please reference my prior article on the pros and cons of looking at book value, specifically as it applies to bank and insurance stocks.The 5 Cheapest P/B StocksAs of April 9, 2013, the 5 cheapest P/B stocks in the Dow are Alcoa (NYSE:AA) at 0.7x, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) at 0.9x, JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) at 1.2x, Travelers (NYSE:TRV) at 1.3x and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) at 1.7x.Note that 3 of these stocks (BAC, JPM and TRV) are bank and insurance stocks. Note that bank stocks and insurance stocks are levered, and the financial assets that are held on their balance sheet can significantly change in value. For example, during the financial crisis in 2007-2008, the values of some of the mortgage products and complex derivatives held by the banks (CMBS, RMBS, sub-prime loans, credit default swaps, etc.) were eventually discovered to be worth just a fraction of what they were recorded as on the bank's balance sheet. As a result, the banks had to write-off losses on these investments, which significantly lowered the bank's book values. Back then, if you believed the book values of the banks at that time, you would have been burned badly.Fast forward to 2013 and the bank's balance sheets are significantly stronger. Furthermore, for calculating P/B multiples for JPM and BAC, I used tangible book value, which removes goodwill and intangibles and therefore is a more conservative book value to look at. Nevertheless, the challenge (and risk) of how to accurately value the financial assets held by banks still remain."
HP May Have To Buy Out 3D Printing Companies At A 25%-110% Premium,Nov.19.13,"Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) plans on entering into the 3D printer market by mid-2014. The 3D printing space is rapidly emerging, and there's plenty of opportunity for further growth.Becoming a 3D printing supplier will take Hewlett-Packard far too long to break into without buying out smaller competitors. The timing for 2014 probably comes from the expiring patents of certain 3D printing technologies giving Hewlett-Packard a better entry point into the market.There seems to be further upside to owning stocks in some of the more established 3D printing equities. Because of this, I'm thinking we should all stay aboard the 3D printing boat. After all, the trend is your friend.Let's establish some background informationCredit Suisse has an accurate estimate of where 3D printing as an industry is likely to be. By 2020, the amount of revenues will be $11 billion from 3D printing, according to Credit Suisse. This is a rapidly growing market.Of course, the systems by themselves represent a very small percentage of cost, what is likely to cost more, is the amount spent on service and direct parts (basically add-on services after the fact). This repeat business should certainly appeal to Hewlett-Packard as it generates a great amount of revenue from servicing computers for companies.Source: Hewlett-PackardIt seems that Hewlett-Packard continues to struggle to generate any business across all of its main segments. In fact, the only segment that actually grew revenue was the software side of its business. The revenue growth was relatively muted at 1% year-over-year, hence the need for Hewlett-Packard to explore new markets such as 3D printing."
Dell And HP Beat Apple On PC Market Share Growth,Oct.18.13,"According to a recent report from research firm IDC, for the first time in recent memory, both Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) beat Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in terms of quarter market share growth. Where Apple lost 11.2%, Dell saw market share tick up by 2.3%, while HP added 3.5%. While there are plenty of explanations for this apparent shift in growth, and I am certainly not suggesting that Apple is ""in trouble,"" the news could be a good sign for the beleaguered PC makers.DELL data by YChartsIn the video below, I discuss various statistics included in the IDC report and what they could mean for the PC industry, and specifically for Dell and HP. While one quarter does not make a trend, if these two companies can get some positive traction, their beaten down stocks might suddenly become quite interesting. As things stand, they remain speculative, but are definitely worth watching.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Comparing IBM's Hardware Segment With Its Competitors,Jun.11.13,"The systems and technology segment generates a substantial portion, 17%, of International Business Machines' (NYSE:IBM) total revenue. The performance of the hardware segment has been a drag on the company's consolidated performance. In this report, IBM's hardware segment's performance will be compared with competitors Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ), and Dell Inc. (NASDAQ:DELL). Is IBM's poor performance company specific, or is the hardware industry going through a period of declining revenue? How does IBM's performance compare to competitors?In the first section, the components of the hardware segments of the companies will be covered. The second section covers the historic performance of the hardware segments. The final section discusses the historic performance of the hardware segments.The recent performance of the hardware segments were poor, generally. I don't think there will be much improvement in the current fiscal year. That said, IBM's performance was in-line with its peers while Dell led the pack.Defining The Hardware SegmentsIBM's systems and technology segments is comprised of its systems, storage, and microelectronics businesses.

IBM Has A Cash Flow Problem,Nov.10.13,"Many long-term investors have followed Warren Buffett into IBM (NYSE:IBM) on the ""buyback thesis."" In essence, while IBM has been struggling to grow revenues and profits, it has been aggressively buying back shares, thereby pushing up earning per share and the share price. It is in this vein that some actually cheered the drop following IBM's most recent quarter as it could repurchase a higher number of shares for the same amount of money. While I understand the logic in this thesis, I would not be a buyer of IBM here.First, underlying business fundamentals matter. Rarely do companies in decline prove to be strong investments. Since 2008, IBM has been unable to grow revenue, and revenue has declined in six consecutive quarters. Importantly, during the last five years, IBM has spent over $17 billion on acquisitions. In other words, it has a negative organic growth rate as competitors like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), SAP (NYSE:SAP), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) have taken share. CIOs have plenty of cloud and business service companies to choose from; it is no longer IBM and no one else. At some point, IBM needs to begin growing again if it is going to sustain cash flows.While the company has been pivoting towards service, hardware is still a significant part of its business, and the company reported a truly stunning 40% drop in China hardware sales with sales in the emerging market down 22% overall in its most recent quarter. These trends have all been getting progressively worse. IBM is a company that has truly lost its mojo. The quarter lacked any signs of a turnaround, and I expect 2014 to bring negative year over year growth.I believe a reason for this has been the company's dogmatic focus on its five year EPS roadmap. When companies focus on hitting near term earnings target, they often will push off investment or focus on financial engineering to deliver good short-term results with disastrous long-term consequences. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) under Mark Hurd is a good example of this. In no sector is this truer than in technology where heavy investment is required to maintain a competitive advantage. IBM would be better off throwing out its guidance, focus on the core business, and reposition the company for growth in the future. Instead, management continues to stick to its plan of pulling various levers, namely buybacks, to boost EPS while the business is on fire."
Memo To Intel Bulls: You People Are Dead Wrong,Sep.10.13,"On October 26, 1999, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) were both added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average as component stocks. This event arguably marked the apex of the PC Revolution as a driver of the technology economy. Accounting for splits, Intel then traded for $27.53 per share, while also operating with 8.7 million shares of common stock outstanding on its balance sheet. Heading into Q4 1999, Intel executives managed a corporation carrying $240 billion in market capitalization. On September 6, 2013, Intel stock closed out the trading session at $22.67, after claiming 5 million shares of common stock outstanding within its latest Q3 2013 financial report. This recent stock market performance calculates out to roughly $110 billion in Intel market capitalization. In fourteen years, the size of Intel's business has literally been slashed in half.Intel management decisions to return larger amounts of capital back to investors, in the form of dividends and stock buybacks have done nothing for shareholder growth. Over the past twenty-four months, Intel has shifted its focus towards aggressive research and development spending, in order to finally establish a beachhead within a mobile chip market dominated by the ARM - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) alliance. Intel bulls are now arguing their case on two fronts. Firstly, the Intel bulls reason that extraordinary R&D spending is artificially depressing net income. Secondly, Intel cheerleaders assume R&D spending to be an up-front investment that will automatically materialize into future growth. Time, however, will prove that R&D spending at Intel is no panacea for growth, because the corporation now operates out of desperation. The situation is similar to a middling NFL franchise throwing money at a fee agent bust - in misguided hopes of exciting fans. Intel is still a strong sell.Intel R&D Spending By The NumbersBe advised that Intel fiscal years generally parallel calendar years. In 1999, during the halcyon days of the PC Revolution, Intel closed out the year with $7.3 billion in net income on $29.4 billion in revenue. Intel had grown net income by 20.5% over the prior year - to cap off a decade that began with a relatively meager $650 million in profits. Between 1997 and 1999, Intel spent 9.8% of annual revenue upon research and development, on average. This R&D allocation was largely in line with the rest of Intel's 1990's growth decade. At most, Intel spent a shade more than 13% of revenue in 1990 and 1992."
Why IBM's Success Will Continue,Jun.11.13,"For decades, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been praised as a technology bellwether and a superb innovator. Recently, however, the stock has lagged the broader averages, rising only 5-6% over the past year while the S&P gained 24% during the same period. This underperformance may be an opportunity to gain exposure to this tested industry leader, and more broadly, the technology sector as a whole. IBM has a long history of strong performance through good times and bad, and this dominance doesn't look to be ending any time soon.IBM is an information technology, or IT, company that generates income by helping its clients solve business challenges and become more efficient. They use their hardware, software, and financing to help clients cut costs and generate revenue. IBM is a dominant innovator, with nearly 67,000 patents secured since 1993. In fact, Big Blue has been the top recipient of patents for 20 consecutive years, and in 2012 it received 6,478 new patents. This outpaced the combined patents for Accenture (NYSE:ACN), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) during the same year. This impressive statistic shows that IBM knows how to create products that continue to generate excitement and, more importantly, a constant revenue stream for the company.IBM's competent management team has steered the company through a variety of challenging situations and has continued to create shareholder value. Ginni Rometty, the current Chairwoman and CEO, is a veteran of the company, having been with IBM for 32 years. Rometty has been listed on Fortune magazine's ""50 Most Powerful Women in Business"" for 8 consecutive years, garnering the #1 spot in 2012. Before taking the position of CEO, Rometty held the title of Senior Vice President and Group Executive for Sales, Marketing, and Strategy. This rise through the ranks of IBM shows that Rometty has the experience needed to keep the company on the cutting edge of the IT industry. Having taken the CEO position in January of 2012, however, Rometty needs more time before her true leadership abilities are shown. Until then, her prior record at IBM means that Rometty is ready for her role at the helm of the company."
Does The Dogs Of The Dow Strategy Really Outperform The Market?,"Oct. 1, 2013 12:43 PM ET","In one of my latest articles, a retired Merrill Lynch Financial Consultant who used to recommend to his clients the ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy asked me, in a very detailed comment, to run a back-test of this strategy in comparison to the market benchmarks and to my own strategies. Since I think many investors are familiar with the ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy, I will show in this article the last fourteen years return of the strategy. I used the Portfolio123's powerful screener to perform the back-test, since Portfolio123's database starts at the beginning of 1999. The back-tests' results are from that date.Dogs of the DowThe ""Dogs of the Dow"" is an investing strategy, popularized by Michael B. O'Higgins in 1991, that consists of buying the ten Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks with the highest dividend yield at the beginning of the year. The portfolio should be adjusted at the beginning of each year to include the ten highest yielding stocks.The table below presents the ""Dogs of the Dow"" at the beginning of 2013.TickerNameIndustrySector(NYSE:T) AT&T Inc Diversified Telecommunication Services Telecommunication Services(NYSE:VZ)Verizon Communications IncDiversified Telecommunication Services Telecommunication Services(NASDAQ:INTC)Intel CorpSemiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment Information Technology(NYSE:MRK)Merck & Co Inc.

Dividends are included in the price data, therefore they are accounted for in the back-test. The theoretical return is calculated in comparison to the benchmarks (Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500), considering 0.25% slippage for each trade and 1.5% annual carry cost (broker cost). The back-tests results are shown in the charts and the tables below."
Lexmark International: Why Is A Printer Company Trying To Reduce Print?,Jun. 3.13,"Lexmark International (NYSE:LXK) is transforming its business model from a hardware-centric company to a solutions provider. Lexmark's history is rooted in providing printing solutions. However, in this digital world where content has been named ""king,"" Lexmark's future is taking wing to solve information challenges by not just providing, but synergistically combining, output management, content management and process management.The technological advancements in the printing industry changed business. In 1959, Xerox (NYSE:XRX) first produced photocopiers. In 1975, IBM (NYSE:IBM) introduced high-speed laser printers to business. By 1984, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) supplied households with a laser model. In 1989 and Canon (NYSE:CAJ) brought color laser printing.When businesses adopted the Internet in the early '90s, it introduced the ability to exchange information electronically, dramatically impacting traditional printing and paper-based communication. Although the elapsed time to exchange information was greatly decreased, users were routinely frustrated with incompatible file formats. Factor in nothing short of an explosion of data as the floodgates opened. That explosion led businesses to grapple with the distinction between ""data"" and ""information."" Characteristics such as the quality, validity, legality or currency of data, information or content was, still can be, and often should be questioned. Significant investments are being made by 73% of CEOs to extract value from their companies' data.In 1999, the Uniform Electronics Transactions Act (UETA) established the legal equivalence of electronic records as viable forms of agreement. During the '90s, businesses quickly found their workflow processes and storage systems were not effective or efficient for handling both paper and electronic records. Automation was necessary. The scanning, electronic storage, classification and retrieval of paper documents became a priority. Software known as Document Management Systems or Electronic Document Management met the needs while also providing automated workflow, change history tracking and secure access."
The 50 Best Performing S&P 500 Stocks in 2013,"Jun. 7, 2013 3:19 PM ET","As of 2 PM today, the average stock in the S&P 500 is up 16.94% so far in 2013. And nearly all stocks in the index are up on the year. Of the 500 members, 453 of them are in the green this year, while just 47 are in the red.Below is a list of the 50 best performing stocks in the S&P 500 year to date. As shown, two stocks -- Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) -- are up more than 100%.

Apple is actually down 16.98% YTD, ranking it as the 7th WORST stock in the index on the year."
"The New 'Intel Inside', Himax Technologies",Aug.14.13,"A fundamental shift has occurred in tech over the last decade. We used to be focused on processing power, ram and hard-drive size in relation to our devices. Instead of trying to work out which computer manufacturer would do best, it was easier to pick between Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro (NASDAQ:AMD) or SanDisk (SNDK). Hence all the ""Intel inside"" ads.The shift has obviously been to mobile. No arguments there. The smartphone wars are raging among Nokia NOK), Motorola/Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and many others, not forgetting the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) role. We all understand that switching to mobile has its limitations and as such are willing to put up with less physical storage and use the cloud instead. The one component which has become all important is Display. Previously, if you wanted better display you went and bought a bigger monitor. Screen size and quality became more important with laptops, but with the shift to smartphones, it is almost the entire device. With the advent of Google Glass, it is going to be even more significant.In this new world, there is one manufacturer who stands head and shoulders above the rest. The new equivalent to Intel, Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX). I have been long for a very long time, in fact almost 400% up from my starting position at $1.58 and still holding.Normally I would be taking my profits, but feel that would be like selling Apple in 2006 for $70 a share. So let's look at the reasons why.Like Intel before them they are in almost everything. Here is a list of some of their customers: SONY (NYSE:SNE), Sharp (OTCPK:SHCAY), HP (NYSE:HPQ), Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), Acer, Samsung, Motorola, Google, Nokia, Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI), Epson (OTCPK:SEKEY), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and many, many more. Take a look at the company's most recent fact sheet released in May of this year.As early as 2009 - 2010, they had recognized there would be a slowdown in high-end devices especially in China. By forming new partnership agreements with tier 1, tier 2 and white box manufacturers, Himax was able to grow into the slump. 2009 is important in many ways: Innolux, the world's third largest panel manufacturer, owns 15% of Himax. In 2009, Himax was extremely dependent on Innolux with 68% of revenues coming from that single customer. Take a look at the table below."
Clark And Mills' 'Masterminding The Deal',"Aug. 27, 2013 7:23 PM ET","After a lengthy hiatus M&A seems to be back in fashion. So it's time to take another look at the often rocky road that companies face when they contemplate acquiring or merging with another company. (Historical data show that ""two-thirds or more of takeovers reduce the value of the acquiring company."") Masterminding the Deal: Breakthroughs in M&A Strategy and Analysis by Peter J. Clark and Roger W. Mills (Kogan Page, 2013) is both a guidebook for corporate boards and executives and a research tool for investors.The first step to M&A success is to get the merger valuation methodology right. The authors describe four methods: event studies, total shareholder return, value gap, and incremental value effect. None of these is a standalone guarantor of success; in fact, the authors recommend combining the last two discounted cash flow methods.Value gap ""reflects the commonsense notion that for a merger to be successful, post-merger improvements in the combined company -- synergies -- must exceed the [acquisition purchase premium] paid by the acquirer to secure control of that target."" (p. 92) As the poster child for what not to do, Hewlett-Packard paid stratospheric premiums for each of its three major acquisitions (3Par, Palm, and Autonomy) when Leo Apotheker was CEO.Incremental value effect looks to the discounted cash flow-based ""valuation of the two principals (acquirer and acquiree) on a standalone basis and combined, including consideration of both realizable synergies and a purchase premium adjustment in the latter."" (p. 108)In their attempt to assess why some mergers succeed while most fail, the authors offer a ranking scheme by merger type. The most successful deals are made by bottom trawlers (87%-92%). Then, in decreasing order of success, come bolt-ons, line extension equivalents, consolidation mature, multiple core related complementary, consolidation-emerging, single core related complementary, lynchpin strategic, and speculative strategic (15%-20%). Speculative strategic deals, which prompt ""a collective financial market response of 'Is this a joke?' have included the NatWest/Gleacher deal, Coca-Cola's purchase of film producer Columbia Pictures, AOL/Time Warner, eBay/Skype, and nearly every deal attempted by former Vivendi Universal chief executive officer Jean-Marie Messier.""

25 Top Cash-Rich S&P 500 Non-Financial Companies,"Jun. 2, 2013 4:50 AM ET","Large U.S. companies hold billions of dollars in cash and cash-equivalents on their balance sheets. The largest of these 83 companies hold over $1.46 Trillion off-shore beyond the reach of the U.S. government according to a report by Bloomberg in March this year. Companies are hoarding such huge piles of cash overseas since they do not want to pay taxes if repatriated back home.They also hold high amounts cash and equivalents in the U.S., as they are unable to invest them in productive ways.While it would be better for all stakeholders if they put this cash hoard to work by building factories and expanding locally and globally, nowadays management and the boards that are supposed to monitor them in many firms are incompetent, selfish and lazy. They would rather waste shareholder wealth on share buybacks, acquisitions or simply help themselves by dipping into the cookie jar with outrageous pay packages, bonuses, stock options and other legally-allowed compensation schemes.The table below lists the Top 25 S&P 500 Non-Financial Companies by Cash & Short-Term Investments held on their balance sheets:S.No. Company Ticker Dividend Yield as of May 31, 2013 Cash ($Mil.) as of May 15, 2013 Sector1 General Electric GE 3.23% 79,390 Industrials2 Microsoft MSFT 2.68% 74,483 Technology3 Google GOOG N/A 50,098 Technology4 Cisco CSCO 2.89% 46,376 Technology5 Amgen AMGN 1.78% 42,075 Health Care6 Apple AAPL 2.74% 39,137 Technology7 Oracle ORCL 0.70% 33,407 Technology8 Pfizer PFE 3.31% 32,708 Health Care9 Ford F 2.70% 32,010 Discretionary10 Johnson & Johnson JNJ 3.04% 21,089 Health Care11 WellPoint WLP 1.95% 20,857 Health Care12 Chevron CVX 3.19% 19,048 Energy13 Coca-Cola KO 2.65% 18,428 Staples14 Intel INTC 3.75% 17,073 Technology15 Merck MRK 3.65% 16,141 Health Care16 UnitedHealth UNH 1.37% 16,088 Health Care17 Abbott Labs ABT 1.48% 15.174 Health Care18 QUALCOMM QCOM 2.18% 13,493 Technology19 Hewlett-Packard HPQ 2.36% 13,012 Technology20 Dell DELL 2.40% 12,777 Technology21 IBM IBM 1.85% 11,993 Technology22 Boeing BA 1.83% 11,853 Industrials23 Freeport-McMoRan FCX 4.11% 9,595 Materials24 Humana HUM 1.37% 9,539 Health Care25 eBay EBAY N/A 9,402 Technology"
Our Favorite Tech ETF: A Low-Cost Way To Tap Into Mobile-Computing Growth,Nov.11.13,"By Robert GoldsboroughAs the U.S. stock market has continued its climb in 2013, investors in large- and mid-cap U.S. technology stocks might wonder whether there's much more runway left. Certain technology subsectors, such as Internet and semiconductors, have done very well, while some tech players, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM, have underperformed both the sector and the broader market.The bull case for the U.S. technology sector revolves around companies that have lagged the broader market but are expected to benefit nicely from continued strong growth in mobile computing, such as Apple, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Broadcom (BRCM). These firms all possess structural competitive advantages, economic moats, reasonable valuations, and exposure to mobile computing. Further gains in the tech sector likely will come from companies benefiting from mobile computing, such as these firms.For investors interested in technology, we recommend Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT). The fund offers an inexpensive way to tap into some of the best parts of the U.S. tech sector, such as its continual growth, its ""moaty"" aspects, and its growing income potential, while at the same time providing a certain stability for investors.As a sector-specific exchange-traded fund, VGT should be viewed as a tactical investment, suitable only for the satellite portion of a diversified portfolio. Over the past five years, VGT had a volatility of return of 20.7% compared with 18.0% for the S&P 500 Index.VGT holds mostly large, well-established technology firms and holds a large number of stocks (414). It does have a top-heavy aspect to it, with its top-10 holdings making up a significant 53.5% of the portfolio. At the same time, VGT has a very high-quality portfolio--wide-moat and narrow-moat firms account for about 51.5% and 31% of the portfolio, respectively, meaning that Morningstar's equity analysts believe that more than 82% of VGT's assets are invested in firms with sustainable competitive advantages."
Monotype Imaging: Has This Bull Had Its Run?,Sep.19.13,"Monotype Imaging (TYPE) has a collection of approximately 150,000 font products that include its own as well as third party owned fonts. Additionally, the company provides printer drivers, page description language, interpreters, and color imaging solutions to OEMs.Monotype Imaging registered a growth of over 75% in the last twelve months. We are bullish on the stock from a long-term perspective because of its strong fundamentals. Monotype Imaging has two segments - OEM and creative professional. The creative professional segment is the fundamental driver of the company's future growth. It has registered a robust revenue growth of 50.75% in the last twelve months due to the large number of fonts it offers and the number of languages it supports.Bullish on Creative ProfessionalThe growth in the creative professional segment remains the most compelling growth driver for Monotype Imaging. This segment registered a robust revenue growth of 64% year over year in 2012. The growth story continued in the first half of 2013, and the segment has delivered revenue of $29.99 million in the first half of 2013, a year over year growth of 29%.The creative professional segment of Monotype Imaging has a catalog of approximately 30,000 fonts, which support more than 40 Latin and non-Latin languages. These fonts are licensed to end users for electronic and print applications. About 67% of the business in this segment is generated by e-commerce websites. The growth drivers for this segment are increasing website development, growth in advertising spending, and the desire of corporates to make their websites look great.Web font business growthThe answer to the reason for continuous growth in the creative professional segment is the utility of web fonts that Monotype Imaging offers. When a consumer buys an electronic device, say, a mobile, laptop, smartphone, or a desktop, the only fonts that the user sees on that device are those that the device manufacturer has licensed. So, if he is looking at content from a source that uses a licensed font that his device manufacturer hasn't licensed, his device will switch to a different font licensed by the manufacturer. The content provider does not want this to happen, so he limits his font choices to the most commonly licensed fonts in order to maintain the original fonts across various platforms."
Absolute Software A Low Volatility Alternative To LoJack,Oct.29.13,"A number of insightful pieces from Seeking Alpha (see here and here) might explain a recent spike in shares of LoJack (NASDAQ:LOJN). But going forward, it should be expected that LoJack will continue move with significant volatility: the company is small, with a market capitalization of $85M, and is speculated to be a takeover target. Investors interested in an endpoint security and management software but not wishing to be exposed to as much stock price volatility should look at Absolute Software (OTCPK:ALSWF) instead. Not only is Absolute Software bigger by market cap ($313M), but the company is flush with $62.9M in cash, has a declining volatility in its share price (55% in 2012 compared to 69% in 2011), and is growing sales. LoJack, by contrast, has $14.8M in debt and $23.8M in cash.Absolute Software's shares may be benefiting from the attention given to LoJack, but still offers an asymmetrical reward relative to a lowered risk profile. It will be reasoned that the prospects are improving more dramatically than the market realizes. A restructuring in operations is lowering the impact of unforeseen headwinds. This sets a floor at its current share price.Company OverviewAbsolute Software offers Computrace, a theft management tool that gives customers a response system for missing devices. To be a leader in device management, the company marketed itself as providing ""Many Devices; One Solution."" In fiscal 2012, sales rose 12% to $88.7M, helped by an expansion to markets ranging from government, healthcare, and corporate.Growth StrategyStronger growth ahead would make Absolute Software an appealing investment. Absolute Software is boosting its sales and marketing unit to grow revenue and to take advantage of the growth in mobile devices. Considering OEM partners represents the primary sales channel, investments in marketing and sales will likely be effective. The company has a moat in device management. It is the only company that couples device management with cross-platform management for PC, Apple, Android, and Windows Phone systems."
"Samsung And Microsoft Have Winning Strategies, Apple Has Some Strategic Decisions To Make","Nov. 25, 2013 7:20 AM ET","The hot spots for growth in smart connected devices are smartphones and tablets. No surprise there.Geographically, the bulk of the growth will take place in emerging markets, and in particular in China and India. No surprise there, again.The theory of the case for a while has been that the opportunity for smartphone suppliers has been to convert feature phone users to smartphones and in particular for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) now that it has purchased the handset business of Nokia with its massive worldwide share of feature phones. Microsoft has placed a lot of emphasis on Europe and emerging markets for its Lumia line of Windows OS smartphones, the latest of which were launched in Abu Dhabi rather than New York.

"Western Digital Corporation - Best-In-Class, Misunderstood And Undervalued?",Nov.13.13,"In my last post, I outlined at a high level an investment case for Western Digital Corporation (NYSE:WDC). I continue to believe that it remains undervalued despite a 69% rally in its share price over the last 12 months, as both the business itself and the industry in which it operates is misunderstood by investors generally. I believe a conservative estimate of the intrinsic value of the business is between $21 billion - $25 billion, compared to its present market capitalisation of approx. $16.9 billion, representing upside of between 23% - 52%. In this post, I set out a detailed fundamental business and valuation analysis for WDC, which I believe justifies my estimate of intrinsic value.1. Executive SummaryWestern Digital Corporation (""WDC"" or the ""Company"") is currently priced at approx. $71 per share in the market, giving a total equity value for the business of approx. $16.9 billion.I conservatively estimate intrinsic value for the entire Company to be in the range of $21 billion - $25 billion, or $86 - $106 per share, based on a detailed fundamental analysis of the business, its industry, management and future prospects.My investment approach for equities is to acquire fractional ownership in businesses at a price that affords me a satisfactory margin of safety to mitigate against error, imprecision, bad luck or the vicissitudes of the stock market. I therefore look to pay prices that approximate no more than two-thirds of a conservative estimate of intrinsic value for an entire business or company.On this basis, my analysis leads me to conclude that WDC is a Buy at $63 or less per share, being a 33% discount to the mid-point of my estimated range for intrinsic value, of $23 billion. I believe that buying into the business at this price level should afford me a satisfactory margin of safety.2. Investment Thesis & CatalystsDespite the significant rise in its share price over the last 12 months, WDC remains undervalued in the market versus a conservative estimate of its intrinsic value. This undervaluation is attributable to a misunderstanding of both the Company and the data storage industry by investors. Essentially, WDC has suffered from a double-fear of obsolescence:"
Commtouch: An Obvious Acquisition Target,Dec.27.13,"(Editors' Note: This article covers a stock that is trading at less than $1 per share and/or has less than a $100 million market cap. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.)Commtouch: an obvious acquisition targetCommtouch (CTCH) is a small Israeli company which provides email security, virus protection, and URL filtering solutions. The company has been public since the late 1990's, originally providing Web-based email service, then moving on to email security in early 2000's, and finally to a full-suit security solution in last two years. Seeking Alpha's Helix Investment Research has already provided good coverage on Commtouch, explaining why next year revenue and net income should improve. I have no intention to repeat the analysis and valuation thesis with which I generally agree. Instead, I want to look at the value of this micro-cap company to much larger ""cloud"" players, who could buy Commtouch for pocket change, but realize tremendous value for their businesses. As an excellent acquisition target, it deserves a significant premium to its ""intrinsic value."" Having a small shareholder base with a strong insider control and low institutional ownership, I expect Commtouch to hold out for a truly premium price of at least 80% above its current trading price.Commtouch has a unique ""private label"" business model (or ""white label"" in their lingo). Instead of marketing a ""Commtouch"" suite of products which would have to compete head-to-head with security giants such as Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC), they sell their services exclusively through third parties, many of which are anti-virus companies themselves (such as McAfee and WebSense). When one uses Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Gmail, the email anti-virus is integrated with Commtouch Software Development Kit (SDK) - a set of software libraries which becomes integrated into Gmail software. Today, Commtouch estimates that 25% of all email vendors are using its products.Commtouch is very relevant and valuable for two reasons: its strong intellectual property, protected by patents, and its ""network effect"" of being able to collect security threat information from a large installed base. It's important to be first to get information on ever-changing Internet Protocol addresses ((IPs)) used to send spam email or new URLs which may lead to malware."
GM Leads Gem Dogs Airing 30% October Upside And Zero Dividends,"Oct. 22, 2013 1:54 PM ET","Ten of 15 Gems Index members from Barron's tallied by Yahoo Finance as of market closing prices October 18 were compared with analyst mean target gain results one year hence.

Dollar Cost Averaging: Viable For Individual Stock Portfolios?,"Aug. 20, 2013 3:53 PM ET","Like many working people, my company offers a retirement plan, which most of us know as a 401(k) plan. I get paid every two weeks and the money that I contribute to my 401(k) is invested for me by the plan administrator into a number of different mutual funds that I can select from. In addition to my own contributions, the company provides a contribution known as ""the company matching funds."" I have worked for this particular company for the last seven years. One thing that I pay attention to is the amount of my own money that I've contributed to the 401(k) plan, separate from the money that the company has added to my investments and separate from any gain or loss that my investments have had.While we can spend a lot of time arguing the quality of the mutual funds in my program, suffice it to say I've done fairly well relative to my own investment and how much the plan is worth today. In the past, I had a tendency to look at my quarterly statements and fret over the ups and downs of my portfolio value. However, when I started looking at the reality of my own money set aside relative to the overall portfolio value at any given time, I found that my worries were lessened.An investment like a 401(k) uses a strategy known as ""dollar cost averaging."" What that means is that you are putting money into the market on a schedule, without any regard for how the market is doing at any point in time. Sometimes the market is down and your money is purchasing more shares than those times when the market is up and you are purchasing fewer shares with the same dollar amount. Over time, you will purchase funds at a number of different price points and you should find yourself with a cost basis that is favorable to your investment.Many dividend growth investors use a variance of this dollar cost average strategy in their individual stock portfolios. Many DG investors will often say that they welcome a pullback in the market, because they can purchase a given stock at a lower price, with a corresponding higher yield point. If the DG investor owns Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), for example, with an initial cost point of $43 a share, then a pullback in KO's price to, say, $35 a share (for the point of illustration) would allow them to purchase additional shares of KO with a lowering of their cost basis and an increase in their combined yield point."
Intel IDF Report Day 2 And The Outlook For 2014 Earnings,Sep.11.13,"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) did not stop making itself felt at the International Developers' Forum (IDF) in San Francisco when it announced that it was shipping 22nm Silvermont processors already, would be shipping 14nm processors by year-end and had a clear path to 10 nm and 7nm processes targeted for 2015 and 2017, respectively. These are dramatic advances compared to the 90 nm process of 2003, for example. With each iteration, chip costs go down, power goes up and device reliability improves. Couple that with Intel's revolutionary voltage control on the chip, and power consumption goes down (read: battery life increases).Intel is targeting smart devices with Silvermont, a market where it has had little representation until now. That seems certain to change, with over 100 tablets and a handful of smart phones today sporting the ""Intel Inside"" logo. Sales of these units will be important to Intel's lagging ""Other Intel Architecture"" segment, which in 2012 had revenues of only $4.4 billion and showed an operating loss of $1.3 billion. I believe Intel has a shot at substantial improvement in 2014 with revenues as high as $7 or $8 billion (based on the addition of 80 to 100 million devices with Intel Inside at $40 content per device), which should be enough to bring the segment to a profit rather than a loss.The decline in the personal computer business has been challenging for Intel, which in 2012 had revenues of $34.3 billion in this segment, a 3% decline from 2011.In 2013, this decline is continuing. Intel is combating the decline with its Haswell and Silvermont processors aimed at PCs from desktop to ultra book to 2 in 1 devices and has augmented the processor advances with its innovative vPro Technology specifications for business computers than include solid state hard drives; wireless display; no password log on to virtual private networks (VPNs) and indoor location based services. Intel announced at IDF 70 devices meeting this specification that should hit the market in early 2014."
How Are WisdomTree's Dividend ETFs Doing?,Aug.15.13,"In an article published in April 2012, I examined three WisdomTree dividend ETFs. WisdomTree recently introduced two new dividend ETFs, so it is a good time to look at them plus revisit the older ones.WisdomTree has devoted a good deal of attention to dividend ETFs. Jeremy Siegel, well-known to many dividend investors, was and still is featured on WisdomTree's home page as ""Senior Investment Strategy Advisor.""This year I counted 24 funds (up from 20 last year) that have either ""dividend"" or ""equity income"" in their names, or are in income-intensive sectors such as real estate or utilities.These are the two new dividend funds that I will examine here:U.S Dividend Growth Fund (NASDAQ:DGRW)U.S. Smallcap Dividend Growth Fund (NASDAQ:DGRS)In addition, I will revisit these three WisdomTree funds that I reported on last year:Total Dividend Fund (NYSEARCA:DTD)Equity Income Fund (NYSEARCA:DHS)Dividend ex-Financials Fund (NYSEARCA:DTN)Two New Dividend Funds from WisdomTreeWisdomTree U.S. Dividend Growth FundWebsite: Click here to see the fund's website.Date Introduced: May 22, 2013Net Assets: $44.4 Million12-Month Yield: NA.

The index is created separately, and then the fund attempts to track it.DGRW's underlying index is the WisdomTree U.S. Dividend Growth Index. This is a fundamentally weighted index that consists of dividend-paying U.S. common stocks with growth characteristics. It contains 300 companies with the ""best combined rank of growth and quality factors,"" specifically (1) long-term earnings growth expectations, (2) return on equity, and (3) return on assets. All stocks have market caps of at least $2 billion. Companies projected to pay more dividends are more heavily weighted. The index is reconstituted (""rebalanced"") once per year, and at that time, the maximum weight of any security is capped at 5% and sectors are capped at 20%."
Cisco And Oracle Now Have A New Competitor: AudioCodes,Nov. 6.13,"AudioCodes (NASDAQ:AUDC) reported earnings last week that beat Oppenheimer analyst's street high estimates of $34.8 million (revenues) and $0.03 (NYSEARCA:EPS) with $35 million and $0.04 respectively. It guided revenues higher to $36 million on stronger backlog numbers in its core networking businesses. I not only listened to the AudioCodes conference call, but listened in on Interactive Intelligence Group's (NASDAQ:ININ) conference call and BroadSoft Corp's (BSFT) conference call and the takeaway from both companies with regards to AudioCodes is that AudioCodes has built a brilliant strategy as I see it benefiting from its partnerships with the hosted companies in the same way as it benefited from partnering with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) with its One Voice for Lync. AudioCodes is selling itself to the hosted companies as an alternative to the tech giants Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), in the same way as it sold itself to Microsoft with great success as a Cisco/Oracle replacement. I believe that in early 2014 as further hosting company partnerships are announced we will see it being loved by Wall Street's sell-side and buy-side which will result in a strong stock performance.Microsoft Lync:Microsoft is doing what it does best in the Lync space, capturing Enterprises new business in the unified communications (UC) space. In Q3, 2013 AudioCodes grew its Lync business by 10% quarter over quarter and its growing by 25% year over year. More importantly, the backlog and new programs lined up during late Q3 and early Q4 will make 2014 a much stronger year than 2013.AudioCodes' initial strategy with Microsoft was to position itself as an alternative to Cisco Systems, Acme Packet (which was later acquired by Oracle) and Sonus Networks (SONS). AudioCodes put itself forward as a small company that could partner with Microsoft and provide it with the pieces it was missing in order to deliver a complete end to end Lync solution to Enterprises. Microsoft embraced AudioCodes' One Voice for Microsoft Lync and the results have been telling with ""Lync Voice leading in enterprise shipments""."

Sonus And AudioCodes: Your 1-2 Punch For Potential Takeovers,Jun. 5.13,"Last week, the session border controller (SBC) pure play Sonus Networks (SONS) met with Jefferies & Co. The analyst subsequently upgraded the shares to outperform sending Sonus' shares up over 30% in 3 days of trading. Also, last week, AudioCodes (NASDAQ:AUDC) announced that it released a new SBC with increased sessions to broaden its offering from 800 sessions to 10,000 sessions in 2013 and to greater than 10,000 sessions in 2014, a significant revenue driver for it. In addition, AudioCodes released its new software for cloud and hosted environments which services the Carrier space something it has never done before. This now makes it a direct competitor to Sonus, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) (via Acme Packet acquisition) in the Carrier space. The SBC enterprise market is estimated to be worth $1 billion by 2016 while the SBC carrier market is estimated to be $1 billion plus. Recently, Oracle cleverly swooped in to acquire Acme Packet at 6.5 times sales and now Sonus and AudioCodes are positioned to be taken out next.Here are the reasons to own Sonus and AudioCodes at what I believe are deep discounts to their intrinsic value:Sonus Networks:· Empire Capital management, a technology driven hedge fund, has acquired 15% of the shares over the past 12 months. When funds go over 10% it is a sign of confidence and indicates that a tremendous amount of homework has been assigned to the investment.· Fidelity Management has now increased its investment in Sonus over the past two quarters from about 1 million shares to over 9 million shares. Speculation is that it will increase its position to 20 - 27 million shares.· Sonus is referred to as the pure play of the publicly traded companies in the SBC market.· Sonus acquired Network Equipment Technologies (NET) (a weaker competitor of AudioCodes) in 2012 in order to participate in the enterprise SBC and unified communications (UC) markets helping it grow its total available market (TAM).· 2014 Revenues (estimate): $300 million. Revenues will see 11% growth over 2013."
Hewlett-Packard: The Tablet Market Is Bigger Than 3-D Printing,Mar.21.14,"I do not doubt that Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) has the resources and technology to become a dominant force in the 3-D printing industry. The recent report revealed HP has resolved two major issues that can help the company compete with industry leaders 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS).Meg Whitman said HP are coming up with 3-D printers that offer faster printing speed and better finish print quality. These claims are still hearsay evidence that HP can really make an immediate impact in the 3-D printing industry this year.The scheduled June announcement is just that - a public unveiling of the company's 3-D ambitions and prototype 3-D printer which won't be ready for mass-market distribution. It is therefore bad for investors to buy HPQ now just because of the latest rumor about its second attempt at conquering the 3-D printing market.3-D Printing Is Still A Baby, 2-D Is Making MoneyI own some DDD shares but due to the brouhaha over the Autonomy deal, it is very unlikely that current HPQ shareholders will accept a merger or buyout deals involving high P/S companies like 3-D Systems or SSYS. This reality doesn't change my mind that HP can have a faster entry in the 3-D printing industry if it takes over a major player.For the short-term, HP benefits little from going head-to-head with the many companies already fighting over the small pie that 3-D printing market currently presents. Additive manufacturing needs more years to become as lucrative as the tablet market is right now."
2 Problems With Hewlett-Packard's Turnaround,Feb.22.14,"Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) turnaround remains intact. On Thursday afternoon, the company reported Q4 results that beat analyst estimates and own previous guidance:· First quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.90, up 10% from the prior-year period, versus the previously provided outlook of $0.82 to $0.86 per share· First quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.74, up 17% from the prior-year period, versus the previously provided outlook of $0.60 to $0.64 per share· First quarter net revenue of $28.2 billion, down 1% from the prior-year period and flat on a constant currency basis· First quarter cash flow from operations of $3.0 billion, up 17% from the prior-year period· Returned $843 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter· Improved operating company net cash position by $1.6 billion, the eighth consecutive quarterly improvement of over $1 billionBut there are two problems with the company's turnaround: The first problem is that it is uneven, concentrated in two segments, Personal Systems and Enterprise Group. Other segments and most notably Enterprise Services and Software continued to decline:Personal Systems revenue was up 4% year over year with a 3.3% operating margin. Commercial revenue increased 8% and Consumer revenue declined 3%. Total units were up 6% with Desktops units down 3% and Notebooks units up 5%.Printing revenue was down 2% year over year with a 16.8% operating margin. Total hardware units were up 5% with Commercial hardware units up 6% and Consumer hardware units up 4%. Supplies revenue was down 3%.Enterprise Group revenue was up 1% year over year with a 14.4% operating margin.

The business delivered an operating margin of 11.6%.Corporate Investments revenue increased due to the sale of a portfolio of mobile computing intellectual property."
Hewlett-Packard Company Bonds: Measuring The Cost Of A Brand Name,Feb.21.14,"In this note we analyze the current levels and past history of default probabilities for Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ), which we last reviewed on July 16, 2013. The company releases earnings after the market close today. We compare those default probabilities to credit spreads on 366 bond trades on 21 fixed rate non-call senior bond issues of Hewlett-Packard Company on February 19, 2014. These trades represented a notional principal amount of $94.7 million. We make a careful comparison of the reward to risk ratio for Hewlett-Packard versus all other bonds traded in the U.S. corporate bond market on February 19.Conclusion: Hewlett-Packard Company has managed a dramatic 0.15% drop across the board reduction in annualized default risk since our July 16, 2013 report. Over a ten year cumulative period, this means there is 0.81% lower chance of a company bankruptcy than there was on July 16. We believe that the majority of analysts would rank Hewlett-Packard Company as an investment grade credit. The bad news is that the iconic nature of the HP ""brand"" has driven the credit spread to default probability ratio for the company to below average levels. Investors earn 4 to 6 times more in credit spread than the default probability on Hewlett-Packard Company. This is only half the level earned at the 10.34 median ratio on 369 bond trades for more than $5 million in the U.S. fixed rate senior debt market on February 19. This differential measures the cost of a ""brand name.""The AnalysisInstitutional investors around the world are required to prove to their audit committees, senior management, and regulators that their investments are in fact ""investment grade."" For many investors, ""investment grade"" is an internal definition; for many banks and insurance companies, ""investment grade"" is also defined by regulators. We consider whether or not a reasonable U.S. bank investor would judge Hewlett-Packard Company to be ""investment grade"" under the June 13, 2012 rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. The default probabilities used are described in detail in the daily default probability analysis posted by Kamakura Corporation. The full text of the Dodd-Frank legislation as it concerns the definition of ""investment grade"" is summarized at the end of our analysis of Citigroup (NYSE:C) bonds published December 9, 2013."
HP Is Bouncing Back With Diversification,Jan.24.14,"Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) is a technology company operating in the industry of diverse computer systems. It is involved in a wide range of operations and is a global provider of products, technology, software, solutions and services to consumers, SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) and large enterprises.Hewlett-Packard generated around 49% of its revenue from Printing and Personal Systems during 2013. ESSN, Services, Software and Financial Services made up around 25%, 20%, 3% and 3% of the revenue respectively, in the same period. This indicates that a substantial amount of revenue comes through printing and personal computers.Market PerformanceShares of HP are listed on the NYSE. In 2013, valuations grew steadily by 79% with little downward fluctuations. The prevailing reason behind this performance is the consistent EPS performance of the company. HP consistently beat analyst estimates in 2013. An increase in dividends by 10% during the year also helped HP to win the investor's confidence. The table below summarizes the revenue and EPS position of the company.TrendsRevenue in billions ($)Oct 2012Oct 2013Oct 2014(E)Oct 2015(E)Revenue120.4112.3109.1108.4EPS2.95*3.563.673.78*Adjusted for non -recurring expensesThe table indicates that revenues are shrinking and are expected to shrink further in the future. The most obvious reason is the decline in PC growth, which in turn affected the printing demand and resulted in the declined revenues. However, the point to note here is that EPS is improving year on year. This can mean two things. Firstly, the company's revenue mix is shifting towards high margin businesses and secondly it is managing its OPEX and other expenses effectively. HP's plan to lay off 27000 workers by the end of 2014 points towards its cost reduction strategy. The operating margin of printing has increased from around 12% to 18% in the past two years. All these factors contributed towards the strong EPS performance of the company. We believe that the improving EPS performance, combined with dividend increases, is reflected in the valuations growth of the company."
Hewlett-Packard Remains An Attractive Investment,May.27.14,"Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) has been suffering from the declining use of the technology it excels at creating. But it is something considered as a norm in the technological sector that every technology sooner or later meets obsolescence. Unfortunately, Hewlett-Packard has not been able to find or create new and outstanding technology that can bring back the days of glory for the company. This article will analyze the company's recent quarterly performance to derive a justified conclusion for investors.Financial PerformanceHewlett-Packard Company reported its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2014, revealing a mixed picture of the company's performance during the quarter. The company missed analysts' expectations by $110 million in terms of revenues, but managed to report EPS in line with the consensus estimates of analysts. It earned an EPS of $0.88 on revenues of $27.3 billion. Revenues for the quarter fell 1% year-over-year, and were flat on a constant currency basis.Segregating the company's performance by segment shows that Hewlett-Packard generates 94% of its revenues from its 4 segments: Printing, Personal Systems, Enterprise Group, and Enterprise Services, while the remaining 6% of revenues are attributable to the Software and HP Financial Services business units."
Hewlett-Packard: Gaining Strength With The Market,Apr.23.14,"Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) has been fighting the decline in revenue for the past eight consecutive quarters. The company extracts money from a number of segments that are indicated in the graph below. Printing and personal systems were grouped together by the company, wherein this group alone accounts for 50% of the company's revenues. Take a look at the following charts/graphs to discern the segment- and geography-wise distribution of the net revenues of the company.Source: First Quarter Earnings Release PresentationThe aggregate revenue of the company has declined by 7% YoY, compared to a 5% decline last year. Top line growth remained stagnant for a few years, before it started trending downwards. Year-end figures indicated that all segments showed negative performance, with a decline in sales in personal systems (-10%) and enterprise services (-8%) being the most significant. The results released at the end of the first quarter of 2014 eased up the pressure across some segments. Although Personal Systems has edged up, Enterprise Services continues to show negative performance. Take a look at the following table to see the performance of each segment throughout the latest quarter."
Will 3D Systems Fall Prey To The Competition?,Jan.29.14,"3D printing technology has gathered a lot of steam in the past few years. Investors who had invested in companies such as 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) earlier are now sitting on big gains. 3D Systems has seen terrific growth in the past, but will it continue doing well with competition from Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ)?With growing competition and bigger players venturing into 3D printing, it seems like the honeymoon period for 3D Systems is over. Although the market for 3D printing is predicted to be worth $8.41 billion by 2020, it seems like 3D Systems is running out of fuel due to the following reasons.Increased competition2014 will witness the expiry of various patents related to 3D printing. This will give birth to various new 3D printer manufacturers and Hewlett-Packard is one of them. The expiry of patents means new companies save on royalty costs and research and development for innovating new 3D printers.One can certainly see tough competition, as every company wants to have a bigger bite of the 3D printing market. Hewlett-Packard is one of the companies looking to establish its hold in 3D printing in 2014.HP is a known brand among customers globally, and has an established marketing network. HP is all set to embrace the 3D printing business and is planning to launch 3D printers which are more cost effective with higher speed. These features will give HP an advantage over 3D systems.The main area of HP's interest is industrial, where speed is an important factor for productivity and HP would be favored over 3D Systems. 3D Systems has a slight advantage in the home consumer segment as it has a few models targeting the consumer market. But 3D Systems needs to be aware of the fact that various Chinese manufacturers are also stepping in and stiff competition is on its way in the consumer market.In addition, HP has a global marketing network which is much bigger than 3D Systems, which should give it a huge advantage when it launches its own products."
Apple: Yes To The iBuild 3-D Printer,May.22.14,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) quit making traditional printers a long time ago. However, Tim Cook is allegedly building an all-in-one 3D printer. This rumor is from 3D Printer World's article. Trip Chowdhry, co-founder and Managing Director of Global Equities Research said Apple's entry in 3D printers is highly likely. Chowdhry theorizes that Android powerhouse Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) will unveil an all-in-one 3D printer during the upcoming June Google I/O conference.Chowdhry explains Google's entry in additive manufacturing is a preemptive strike against Apple which it believes is planning or already working secretly on a 3D printer product. I am invested in both Google and Apple. However, I firmly believe that the iPhone maker will find more success selling high-priced 3D printers and additive materials.Apple Will Find It Easier To Sell 3D PrintersThis is not to disparage the capability of Google's marketing team but Apple really enjoys a CULT-LIKE FOLLOWING for its computers and smartphones. An additive manufacturing printer and the materials for using it are expensive. Most of Apple's diehard customers are certified members of the middle-class, affluent, or good-salaried citizens.Apple outgrew the market cap of Google because it was very effective in making repeat sales of high-priced products to a loyal group of customers. Yes, Google can come up with a cheap high-quality consumer 3D printer for $399 and yet Apple will most probably sell 10x more 3D printers with price tags of $999 or higher. Apple's $799 iPhone 5S handily outsold the $349 Google Nexus 5."
Gigamon: High-Growth Value Stock And Likely Takeover Candidate,May. 8.14,"Gigamon (NYSE:GIMO) is a network visibility, monitoring and security vendor that went public in 2013, and is still fairly undiscovered and unfamiliar to investors. It is not your typical IPO company as it has developed market leading technologies, has been profitable for several years, and is growing its top line at 25%-35% YoY.The company has grown top line in excess of 30% over the past several years, and this growth is expected to continue at 25%-35% given the company's nascent 7% penetration rate of its TAM. This future growth will come from underpenetrated enterprise markets including Fortune 1000 companies, international expansion, further penetration into the service provider market, and expansion into security offerings. The company's TAM (total addressable market) is estimated between $2 and $3 billion growing at double digits annually driven by cloud and big data, as well as the rapid transition from 1G Ethernet connections to 10G, 40G and 100G connections.Gigamon is a likely strategic M&A candidate given its technology and reasonable valuation. Among potential suitors are traditional switch and routing companies (Cisco, Brocade, and Juniper) as well as Oracle, IBM, Hewlett Packard, Dell, Riverbed, F5 Networks with Oracle, and Cisco making the most strategic sense.Oracle has made acquisitions of complementary technologies by buying session-border controller specialist Acme Packet and network optimization specialist Tekelec at premiums of 8 and 10 times their revenues, respectively. Gigamon's leading technology and products would bolster Oracle's fledgling network tools solutions and its hardware business (formerly Sun) in its effort to further diversify into enterprise network and service provider markets. Oracle needs Gigamon to solidify its data center, cloud and big data offerings as the industry transitions from 1G to 10G, 40G and 100G Ethernet connections. For Cisco, Gigamon's technology will be value adding to its switching and data center offerings. And Cisco has to cherish Gigamon's 75%-77% gross margins and targeted operating margins of 23%-28%. For both Riverbed and F5 Networks, acquisition of Gigamon would make strategic sense in terms of technology and addressable markets. For example, Riverbed acquired network performance specialist Opnet for 6 times revenues and already closely partners with Gigamon. It may also consider acquiring Gigamon to fend off the acquisition proposal by an activist investor Elliott Management."
Neonode: 6 Reasons To Buy This $6 Stock,Apr.22.14,"The market had its sixth straight day of gains today. As ""Risk-On"" investors come back into the market, I am allocating a little more of my ""dry powder"" to small cap stocks that took a hit in the sell-off that commenced at the beginning of March.One of these is a small touch sensor tech company called Neonode Inc. (NASDAQ:NEON). I took a small position in this tech play this morning.Company Overview:Neonode develops and licenses the next generation of optical multisensing touch solutions for some of the world's largest consumer brands, including Sony (NYSE:SNE), Volvo (OTCPK:VOLVY), Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS), Kobo, Oregon Scientific, Alpine (OTCPK:AELEF), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company has been public since 1992, and has a market capitalization just north of $200 million. The stock sells for just under $6 a share6 reasons NEON is worth more than $6 a share:Neonode has been working with Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) since late in 2012. The first Hewlett-Packard printers are launching with Neonode's touchscreen technology. This is a huge relationship. as the company sells over 40 million printers a year, and this technology will be incorporated into myriad models. Neonode's technology will also be featured in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) CarPlay product.Earnings are at the start of a powerful ramp-up. The company lost 37 cents a share in FY2013, but the current consensus calls for Neonode to post a loss of just about a dime a share in FY2014. In FY2015, current projections call for the company to make about 70 cents a share in profit.Revenues are expected to skyrocket over the next few years as well. The company posted revenues of less than $4 million in FY2013. Sales are expected to more than triple this year to over $13 million on the back of new project launches. Over $70 million in revenues are penciled in using the current consensus for FY2015.An insider made two purchases of totaling some $200K over the past month. These were the first insider buys since September 2012. The stock more than doubled over the next year after those previous insider purchases.The company has net cash on its balance sheet, is priced at just over 8x projected FY2015 EPS, and has 16 patents, with another 78 pending.The stock is significantly under the price targets placed on it by various analysts. Only three analysts cover the stock, but they have price targets ranging from $11.25 to $14 a share on NEON."
A Moat Full Of Immortal Dinosaurs,Apr.22.14,"Warren Buffett (who actually introduced the concept of ""moat"" into business analysis) says: ""In business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats.""Many of the moats that protect businesses from their competitors are made of brand power, large scale and/or permanent cost advantages or intellectual property.With IBM (NYSE:IBM) as one of the largest investments in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) stock portfolio, we can be quite confident that Buffett saw a nice moat around Big Blue's business. However, during the 2013 Berkshire shareholder meeting Buffett said:I don't understand the moat around IBM as much as around Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). I have some understanding of it, but would have more conviction about the moat around Coke or Wrigley or Heinz than IBM, but I feel good enough about IBM that I put money in it, and nothing precludes Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM both being successful. In fact, I hope both are. We have enough conviction about IBM's position. I like their financial position. Odds are good. I don't feel the same degree of conviction about that than BNSF railroad. I can't think of anything going wrong with BNSF. I can think of some things wrong with IBM.Many investors interpreted this statement as an admission that Buffett was losing confidence. While I don't believe that a few bad quarters would change Buffett's ideas on IBM (remember that it took him several quarters just to build his position), it is certainly important to understand as much as possible about IBM's moat in order to be able to spot in time an eventual deterioration.So what is IBM's moat made of?"
Buy Petrobras: Why This $10 Oil Stock Bargain Could Once Again Be Trading For $50 In 6 Years,Mar.19.14,"Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) was created in 1953, and it is one of the largest oil companies in the world. About 35% of this company is owned by foreigners, around 19% is owned by investors in Brazil, and about 46% is owned by the Brazilian Government.Petrobras shares have been making new 52-week lows recently in what appears to be a perfect storm of negative sentiment. Investors have been dumping emerging market stocks, and in particular, Brazilian stocks over concerns about Federal Reserve tapering. Investors have also been selling stocks that are in the cross hairs of the ""slowing"" economy in China. Since China is a major consumer of commodities and oil, and because Brazil is a leading producer of these types of natural resources, this has pushed down many Brazilian stocks, including Petrobras. Take a look at the chart below to see how much the market has punished this stock in recent weeks:Petrobras is clearly in the cross hairs of extremely negative sentiment towards Brazil, emerging markets, and China (consumption concerns). However, this is creating an amazing buying opportunity for contrarian and longer-term investors. This wave of negative thinking is creating bargains in the stock market and investors who can think beyond the ""herd"" mentality, could be in for major long-term gains. Psychology plays a huge part in stock investing and you have to have a strong mind in order to avoid buying hot stocks at the euphoric highs and selling bargain priced stocks which are trading at the lows. About a year or two ago, French oil giant Total (NYSE:TOT) was in the cross hairs of extremely negative sentiment towards Europe. This took the share price down to about $40 and it gave contrarian investors a great buying opportunity since the stock now trades for about $64. Right now, the ""herd"" is busy chasing momentum stocks like Plug Power, Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG), an alternative energy company. Plug Power shares have surged from a 52-week low of about 15 cents and recently traded for about $11 per share, which is more than what Petrobras trades at. Never mind that Plug power has posted losses and has limited revenues of about $25 million for last year, it is a hot stock and investors want this ""winner""."

Google Or Apple: Which Is The Better Long Term Bet?,May.16.14,"It seems that over the past several years Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) / (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continue to play the game anything you can do I can do better. Both tech giants have their own way about building and developing their own brand, but as an investor the question of which one is the better investment is something that is always a bit allusive. Below we will examine both firms' fundamentals, products, pipeline, sales growth, and overall long term potential to try and come to an answer on which is the better stock to own.AppleApple announced during its blockbuster second quarter earnings announcement that it planned to split its stock by 7:1 effective June 9th. This split at today's market price ($590) would have the ""new"" stock price start trading at $84.28 per share. This news comes just a few months after Google split its own stock in what I would consider to be a very creative ""stock split"". The firm issued class C shares in a 1:1 exchange for the existing A shares. This move effectively cut Google A shares in half or created a 2:1 split.Apple's stock split should have a net positive effect on the stock. For starters it will make the stock more attractive to retail investors simply because of the effective purchase price being cheaper. Second, it will make the stock more attractive for larger and mid-sized funds to pick up and have as a part of their portfolio. Thirdly, given that the effective price will be less I think there is a good chance that Apple could be added to Dow Jones Industrial Average index. At its new price the weighting would not dramatically affect the Dow's daily price movements on down days for Apple."
Valeant: Poor Earnings Quality Masked By Acquisition Related Pro-Forma Reporting,May.21.14,"BackgroundAccounting shenanigans are as old as financial reporting, but have lost favor among corporate managers as the potential penalties in the post-Enron world are more severe. The presence of an active community of short-sellers that seek to sniff out these tricks, and the emergence of databases where queries can easily be run to see if receivables, inventory or PP&E are rising more than they normally would has also helped reduce the incidence of accounting fraud. But changing times lead to new innovations, and CEOs have discovered that the surest way to goose up one's stock is to exclude an ever-increasing amount of expenses and present pro-forma or non-GAAP numbers. Investors have apparently resigned themselves to ignoring such recurring and operational expenses like stock-based compensation, non-cash interest (due to convertible accretion), transaction expenses, restructuring charges and amortization of financing fees. Low interest rates have helped companies make acquisitions and easily present them as accretive by accelerating expenses and treating the charge as non-recurring. This was a technique perfected by Tyco in days gone by, but today's ardent practitioners are doing even better by layering on an additional element - the ignoring of intangible amortization after buying companies with patents and product rights that have a definite life. This practice is particularly rampant in the pharmaceutical space, with Valeant (NYSE:VRX) and Actavis (NASDAQ:ACT) being the main players employing it.To simplify things, imagine a company with a patent that generates $20 of revenue per year, has associated costs of $10 and has five more years to expiration. The undiscounted value of these cash flows is $50. Simple logic would tell you that buying this company for $50 does not create any value. The GAAP accounting after such an acquisition would show:"
"Is Apple, Google, And Samsung Getting Ready For Sensor Hubs In Their Ecosystems To Fuel Their Products And Stock Price?","Mar. 24, 2014 5:48 PM ET","I think a larger screen in the next generation iPhone is a foregone conclusion. I would like to first say that to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) credit, its products have stayed true to the four consumer favorites, they are easy to use because users don't have to read any instructions; and they always can count on something do with the product; they are mechanically strong; they are beautiful; and they are very dependable. However, I noticed there is a lot of discussion by engineers and investor analysts who are clearly overlooking the fueling possibilities that Apple's Ecosystem provides. This is the thing that a lot of pundits writing about Apple's doom and gloom are missing. Once you are are user of Apple's ecosystem, it's hard to leave.: Source Apples EcosystemApple's iTunes store is an important part of the Ecosystem design in the years to come. In February, 2013, Apple reported 25B downloads from more than 315 million customers using Apple devices. The software to hardware interface is easy to use and reliable. The ecosystem is more important than the hardware, as Apple learned in the 1980's when competitors ate its lunch by being able to clone hardware. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is learning that it's not easy to develop an ecosystem or applications that can compete with Apple. Apple's CEO Tim Cook needs to stick to Steve Jobs inspiring and oft quoted ""simplicity"" mantra:""That's been one of my mantras - focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.""Needless to say, Apple must keep the ecosystem Steve Jobs built simple. Investors learned when Apple introduced the iPhone 5S that Apple was getting hardware ready for some greater ecosystem advancements. How did we learn this from 5S? AAPL's 5S has a 64-bit application processor, which I believe will be used this year to better implement fingerprint security encryption technology, to make purchases from AAPL and other retailers very secure and trustworthy. The fingerprint technology is actually made possible by a tiny M7 co-processor chip from NXP Semiconductor (NASDAQ:NXPI):Source:My focus is on the introduction of AAPL's tiny M7 co-processor, which is really a sensor hub, and this is where the iPhone and Apple's products will get really interesting in the future. However, the M7 sensor hub will meet some stiff competition from Google, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), HTC (OTC:OTC:HTCKF), Kyocera (NYSE:KYO), Huawei, ZTE (OTCPK:OTCPK:ZTCOY) and Sony (NYSE:SNE) who are expected to adopt a new first-ever patent pending ultra low power in-system reprogrammable sensor hub chip manufactured by QUICKLOGIC (NASDAQ:QUIK) that I wrote about in a previous article. Sensor hubs are tiny and must consume less than 1% of battery power to be useful in small always-on devices. The M7 opens the door for a huge market in ""wearable"" devices and we will see mobile OEMs leverage their respective ecosystems using sensor hub technologies. AAPL's M7 positions the hardware in the middle of the sensor application and sensor fusion paradigm shift we are entering this year. Google's Android smartphones should also be able to leverage the fingerprint technology using the QUIK reprogrammable sensor hub that cleverly uses Complex Instruction Set Computing (OTC:CISC) Arithmetic Logic Unit technology. The coming wave of mobile smartphone, tablet and wearable devices will be able to use written applications to control the tiny sensor hub that continuously communicates with smartphones and other devices to perform functions that previously could only be imagined. OEM's want the flexibility to reprogram and open source software development for these sensor hubs because they continue to develop and improve powerful written functions for their ecosystems, as a means of making their products more desirable and productive for consumers.In the beginning, investors expect that the sensor hub, using finger print technology, will allow AAPL to establish a payment processing business and take away some business from PayPal. I believe we will see AAPL's simple ecosystem penetrate further into the television strategy started with Apple TV's hockey puck that some consumers use, in content delivery, which can make other industries vulnerable to AAPL's and other OEM mobile manufactures ecosystem reach. Shortly, I expect that these new sensor technologies will give more competition to companies traditionally in direct contact with consumers and their wallets, like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Sony, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Heck, I believe they might even be able to put a tiny electronic patch on your skin to monitor your vitals, and encroach on your doctors turf, by helping him better understand, monitor and treat your medical condition. The emerging Internet of Things (IOT) is based on the simplicity of the sensor technology being integrated into the ecosystem of mobile devices and other consumer electronic networks. The three Titans of mobile computing will be the first to market. AAPL, Google, and Samsung will be incorporating sensor hubs (co-processors) to manage the ecosystem they are now developing. Sensors make it simple, efficient and possible for smart communication devices to continue to be in contact with the ecosystem, even when the main applications processor is sleeping. We should see new products, applications and communications devices being developed in the very near future. Apple will lead the way, as the first mover with the M7 sensor hub and the 64-bit processor.Bottom Line AnalysisAt the end of 2013, AAPL closed the year with a staggering $170 billion in cash and long-term investments. AAPL's market cap is currently approximately $475 billion. APPL's ecosystem and mobile designs will continue to evolve with the M7 sensor hub designed to take AAPL's ecosystem to the next level with wearable devices and new functions that previously were not thought possible. APPL should be able to return to growth as the ecosystem built by Steve Jobs amazes consumers with advancements in sensor hub technologies and applications. I believe there are still some compelling reasons to be invested in AAPL's stock.Disclosure: I am long AAPL, QUIK, GOOG. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Volume Always Precedes Price,"Jan. 11, 2014 3:32 PM ET","This statement is one of the cardinal beliefs held by most technicians. It first came to my attention in the late 1970s when I read Joe Granville's book New Strategy of Daily Stock Market Timing for Maximum Profit, where he wrote ""stocks do not rise in price unless demand exceeds supply. Demand is measured in volume and thus volume must precede price.""In the early stages of my career, I did extensive testing of this concept and developed my own methods of interpreting the on-balance volume. It is the volume indicator in which I have the most confidence. Over the years, I have explored the OBV in more detail and last year discussed multiple time frame analysis of the OBV in The Best Volume Indicator.In that article, I discussed the long-term bottoming and topping formations in the OBV and why the relationship of the OBV to its 21-period weighted moving average can be so important. I touched on the bullish and bearish setups that I have often observed with the OBV, which is the focus of this week's trading lesson.Catching a major low in a stock or ETF is often difficult given the huge number of issues that are traded. I feel that tops are identified more frequently as after a long rally phase, a stock is often watched more closely. Therefore, changes in the volume and price patterns are noticed by more analysts.In many instances, the OBV will form a positive divergence at a major low but sometimes it does not. These divergences can be explained by a transition where the demand starts to gradually exceed supply as prices reach a low point. Negative divergences at a top are a result of the fact that fewer buyers (lower volume) are pushing prices higher.Click to EnlargeHewlett Packard Co. (HPQ) was one of the least-favored stocks for 2013, but turned out to be one of the winners. On the monthly chart of HPQ, I have included the OBV and volume under the candle chart along with what I call Aspray's OBV Trigger (AOT). It is a histogram plot of the spread between the OBV and its 21-period WMA.The AOT will often trigger a buy or sell signal by flipping above or below the zero line but it can also identify long-term divergences in the volume patterns that are not evident using the OBV.As HPQ was making its high in March 2010, the monthly OBV was also making a new high (see arrows). However, the OBV was closer to its WMA, causing the AOT to form lower highs, line b. At the end of June, the AOT first dropped below the zero line. It did reverse the following month, but then triggered a sell signal as it dropped sharply with August's high volume.In November, the long-term uptrend in the OBV, line a, was tested before HPQ managed a weak rebound over the next two months. This presented an excellent opportunity to get out of long positions or to sell short as the OBV just rallied back to its now declining WMA (line 1). The AOT never turned positive on the rally and turned lower the following month, giving advance warning of the break in the OBV trend line support, line b.The AOT hit its lowest level in September 2011 when HPQ traded down to $21.50. The final price low at $11.35 was not made until November of 2012. The OBV made a new low with prices but the AOT formed higher lows, line c, indicating that the selling pressure was not as strong as it was in 2011.The daily chart gives a different perspective of the November 2012 low when the daily volume spiked to over 154 millions shares as HPQ gapped to the downside, which in hindsight, was the final stage of the panic liquidation. Six days later, the daily OBV moved back above its WMA but soon pulled back to its WMA. The AOT was above the zero line and also corrected but stayed positive. The next day, it turned higher suggesting that the pullback was over.Click to EnlargeThe AOT peaked on December 12 as HPQ corrected for about two weeks, eventually dropping slightly below its 20-day EMA on December 28. On that day, the AOT dropped below zero but reversed to positive the following day, line 2.Those who went long before the close were rewarded as the following day, HPQ was up 5.4%.If you are looking to buy a stock or ETF on a pullback, this approach works most of the time. Just wait until the OBV has dropped back to or below its WMA, then watch, and if the stock is higher the next day or week, you can go long especially if the volume has increased. Alternatively, you could go long on a buy stop above a recent high.In early 2013, the AOT formed a longer-term divergence, line a, and by the end of January, had turned negative. This was the start of a 24-day correction, though surprisingly, there was only one daily close below the 20-day EMA. The volume in February was low, line b, and the OBV moved above and below its WMA.Then on February 21 ( line 3), the volume increased to 37 million from an average of 15 million the prior ten days. This moved the OBV out of its range, and the AOT rose to its best level in a month. HPQ closed up over 12% the following day.Click to EnlargeOne of the hottest stocks for a good part of 2013 was Tesla Motors (TSLA). Any news related to its cars quickly moved to the front page in the financial press. From a technical perspective, the volume surge the week of April 5 (line 1) was very bullish. The OBV moved above the February high, line a, as TSLA formed a doji, closing at $41.37. The AOT was clearly positive but still below its prior peak.The stock continued higher the following week, closing at $43.75 with both the OBV and AOT improving sharply, confirming the bullish outlook. From the weekly chart, there was little in the way of a pullback over the next seven months as TSLA made a high of $194.50 in early October.The OBV did confirm the highs, line b, but dropped below its WMA two weeks later. The AOT peaked in May and then formed divergences (line d) both in August and late September, just before the price highs. The week after the AOT turned negative it bounced back to slightly positive as the OBV moved barely above its flat WMA, line 2. A sell signal was confirmed two weeks later as the OBV support at line c, was broken. Despite the recent rally, the AOT has stayed negative.Click to EnlargeIn late 2013, the daily chart of Cablevision Systems (CVC) was a good example of a daily buy setup. The stock had been in a well-established downtrend from the August high of $20.16. The OBV was in a clear downtrend, line a, and was forming lower lows (line b). CVC formed three consecutive dojis in late November before the strong surge on November 21.The volume was the heaviest since February as the OBV moved above its WMA and the AOT had its highest reading since August. Three days later, the OBV broke through its downtrend (line a) but many probably thought they had missed their opportunity to buy.CVC had closed above its daily starc+ band and continued to test it for the next two days (point 2). This was a sign to wait as CVC was in a high-risk buy zone. Just four days later, CVC had corrected back to its 20-day EMA. The AOT bottomed eight days later, line 2, but did not drop below zero.The WMA of the OBV was clearly rising and the 20-day EMA was tested for three more days before CVC again turned sharply higher. It gained over 12% in the next two weeks. CVC has dropped five days from the highs with the AOT now negative.Click to EnlargeCray (CRAY) has been a stellar performer for the past two years as it was up 142% in 2012 and 72% in 2013. It is already up over 16% in 2014 as the weekly chart shows the strong close last week.The volume has been leading prices since 2012 as the AOT moved firmly back above zero in August of 2012, and the OBV broke through its resistance (line a) the following month. During the post election selloff in November, the AOT dropped below zero for one week before flipping back to positive (line 1).In early April of 2013, CRAY hit a high of $23.59 but then reversed to close the week lower and below the prior week's low. On a weekly chart, this is a sign of weakness that is almost always followed by a further decline. The OBV did form a slight negative divergence at the highs (blue line) but the AOT did not drop below zero until May.This plunge in May was in reaction to disappointing earnings as CRAY dropped to between the 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci retracement support levels calculated from the early 2012 lows. This area is typically a good buying zone in a correction. The AOT dropped below the zero line for two weeks before reversely sharply (line 2) as an HCD buy signal was generated.Less than three months later, CRAY was making another new high at $28.58. There was no clear divergence at the highs though the AOT did peak a week early. The AOT drifted lower for the next 12 weeks, finally dropping below the zero line for two weeks last November. The volume was strong the following week (line 3), and the OBV moved back above its WMA. Buyers had another chance in December as CRAY dropped below its 20-week EMA while the OBV just tested its WMA (point c).Of course, the AOT works in any market as long as they have adequate volume. The monthly analysis of the Spyder Trust (SPY) and PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) turned back to positive last July while it was positive all year for the SPDR Dow Industrials (DIA).Click to EnlargeThe PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) had a sharp selloff in the fall of 2012 as it peaked in mid-September along with Apple (AAPL). The QQQ triggered an LCD the week after the highs and the OBV formed a short-term negative divergence, line a.The AOT peaked in August and then formed lower highs, line b, and by early October dropped below the zero line. On the volume chart, the selling was quite heavy over the next four weeks as the OBV dropped well below its WMA. By late 2012, the OBV and the AOT had gradually improved as indicated by line c.In early February of 2013, the AOT moved above the zero line for two weeks before turning negative. The positive signal the following week (line 2) was supported by higher volume than the prior two weeks. The rally over the next nine weeks was gradual, though it picked up steam in early May.NEXT PAGE: The AOT On the Spyder Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY)Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
"An Onslaught Of High Performance, Low Cost Smartphones Spells Trouble For Apple",Feb.27.14,"The $25 smartphone has arrived and it is a pretty solid device. Spreadtrum Communications and Firefox introduced the device at Mobile World Conference and for markets where cost is a real barrier, it will be a popular option.While the device is not a threat to high end smartphone makers, it is a sign of the direction the smartphone world is heading - lower average selling prices (""ASPs""). Two forces will drive the trend - the end of subsidies and the introduction of fully featured lower cost smartphones with impressive performance.Subsidies for smartphones are on their way out and prepaid phones are replacing them on ""contract fee"" voice and data plans. NPD Group predicts that 5 out every 6 smartphones sold in emerging markets will be a prepaid device.Until recently and particularly in developed markets, high subsidies have prompted faster replacement rates for smartphones, boosting demand by shortening the upgrade cycle according to analysis by industry expert Roger Entner, the founder of Recon Analytics.That cycle seems to have run its course. The market share of unsubsidized prepaid smartphones is increasing rapidly according to research by NPD Group."
Infoblox Could Become Essential To Its Customers,Mar.19.14,"Infoblox (NYSE:BLOX) is a company that relies on growth to drive its stock price, and without active news generation the earnings reports are going to be the prime movers of the share price. A growth driven stock requires an understanding of its product offerings. There is not much information out there about what Infoblox does, so I decided to look at white papers and datasheets. I am not an engineer, but as an investor you only need a basic understanding of the technology and products. A poorly managed company with a great product is at least a buyout target, while a company with a pointless product will disappear eventually.I will start by looking at the products and services that make up Infoblox's primary business of network management and automation. Then I will consider the new security product line that the company hopes will become a major revenue driver in the future. This is followed by analysis of the most recent earnings call and the company's finances. Finally, I will discuss some ideas for managing an Infoblox investment.Network Complexity Requires New ToolsInfoblox offers products that can help network engineers see the entirety of the network, and automate the most basic tasks. Visibility is important for troubleshooting problems. Automation helps keep staff numbers lower and provides consistency.Infoblox allows an engineer to see all the devices on the network as a basic feature. The same appliance also allows the engineer to manage the network as a whole, or some assigned part thereof, from the terminal. The three basic functions that Infoblox helps manage is referred to as DDI, which is DNS, DHCP, and IP."
Quindell PLC: A Country Club Built On Quicksand,Apr.22.14,"SUMMARY42%-80% of Quindell's (OTC:QUPPF) profits are suspect, as we are unable to reconcile the whole with the sum of the parts.Quindell was little more than a country club until 2008/2009, yet QPP somehow began reporting Microsoft/Google-esque profit margins in 2010/2011.26%-43% of Quindell's 2009 and 2010 revenues came from ClickUs4.com, a subsidiary owned by CEO Robert Terry.41% of Quindell's 2011 revenues came from an undisclosed related party (controlled by a QPP executive).10+ acquisitions lack economic substance.

Intel's Economic Moat,Mar.15.14,"Intel's Economic MoatIt is hard to think of a firm that has a more compelling economic moat than Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).The source of this moat is straight-forward: There is literally no firm on the face of the earth that has Intel's technical capability in mass producing digital logic chips-the electronic brains that power laptops, desktops, and servers. Despite similar financial resources, Intel's largest manufacturing competitors Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Global Foundries, and TSMC (NYSE:TSM) are still consistently one generation behind its production capabilities thanks to its manufacturing prowess. In an industry that, in a very real sense, has reinvented itself once every 18 months for the last half century, Intel has had a largely uncontested first mover advantage twice every three years.INTC data by YChartsValuation Drivers: RevenuesIt is a testament to the strength of Intel's microprocessor franchise that it has been able to maintain the revenue growth it has throughout the demand shift toward mobile devices. It has emerging market demand for PCs and demand for cheap, general-purpose servers to thank for that revenue growth. It is interesting to note that Intel's processors were originally considered data center also-rans. That is, until someone realized relatively cheap Intel x86 ""boxes"" could be chained together to approximate the power and performance of specialty chips manufactured by IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) Sun segment. In a twist of Tech Karma, companies selling processors based on designs by ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) may now be trying to eat into Intel's server share in the way Intel originally ate into Sun's and Big Blue's."
EMC: Analyzing The Opportunity In The All-Flash Array Market,Jan.14.14,"Everyone wants a piece of flashEMC Corporation's (EMC) newly launched all-flash array XtremIO is gaining traction with Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, or VDI, projects. VDI hosts a desktop operating system, or OS, within a virtual server, eliminating installation of traditional OS in between. Previous VDI projects often failed because they were attempting to replicate pilot test results in actual production, but this is possible using XtremIO. Around 70% of the XtremIO deals involve VDI projects, and it will open up new opportunities for XtremIO.The demand of flash array storage is growing fast since traditional hard disk drives have failed to live up to the expectations of Big Data and Cloud storage. As a result, companies are now more inclined to use flash array in their data centers. The flash array market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 58.5% and reach $1.2 billion by 2015. Looking at this opportunity, different storage companies like NetApp (NTAP), Pure Storage, and Nimbus Data have decided to launch storage systems using flash technology. However, competition is not something new to EMC; it has competed with its peers successfully in the past. The competition is getting intense, as just a few days after EMC launched XtremIO, NetApp's also launched its new all-flash array storage system, EF550, along with its storage array E2700 and updated E5500 array. Through these launches, NetApp aims to target a wider audience with its E-series portfolio for those that want high speed from a flash solution.(Source: Permabit)Although, none of these companies have achieved a supreme position in flash array and each one has a competitive edge over the other in one way or another.XtremIO's advantage is its deduplication feature of ""always on,"" while NetApp allows customers the option to turn off deduplication since it affects the performance. However, the XtremIO array performance isn't impacted by deduplication, and it stores all the data in the DRAM. In comparison EMC, Nimbus uses significantly less DRAM, thus making it more cost effective, while supporting deduplication. Nimbus data boasts of its lower power consumption; it is ten times more power efficient than EMC's XtremIO."
"Who's Winning The Battle Of SaaS, CRM And ERP Among The Big 4","May 26, 2014 7:18 AM ET","The PlayersSoftware companies around the globe are racing to get a better foothold in the Software as a Service space with regards to both Enterprise Resource Planning and Customer Relation Management software.In the latest report from Gartner, the CRM area grew some 14% between 2012 and 2013, from $18 billion to $20.4 billion. Gartner also points out that 41% of CRM systems sold were based on SaaS and that growth in the ERP sector was better in 2013 than in 2012, at just under 4%.The interesting portion of this is that over 40% of these two sectors were sold as SaaS packages. Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is the dominant player in the CRM market, while SAP AG (NYSE: SAP) has been the dominant player in the ERP market.IMG Source: Forbes.comERP and CRM software companies are rapidly moving into the SaaS atmosphere, which also changes the revenue model for companies such as SAP, Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) and even Microsoft Corporation (NYSE: MSFT) who in the past have relied on perpetual licenses as well as annual maintenance fees.SaaS relies on annual subscriptions, which leads to recurring turnover with clients year over year. There are other players in this brutal competition for dominance and market share but for now let's just concentrate on the current state of these four companies.Where do they all stand and where are they going?Oracle Corporation had very little growth in the CRM space in 2013 at only 4%, but the company still retained third spot in the CRM space with at 10% of total market share.Oracle is also number two in the ERP market with just over 12% of the market but here again achieved little to no growth in 2013 in the ERP sector."
Deep Value In The S&P 500 Index,May.16.14,"By Alex BryanMost value index funds target the cheaper half of the market, which tends to sweep in a large helping of blend stocks that dilute their value tilts. In contrast, Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Value (NYSEARCA:RPV) targets the cheapest third of the S&P 500 Index and weights its holdings by the strength of their value characteristics. This style purity allows investors to add a value tilt to a diversified portfolio with a smaller investment in this fund than its peers would require.This approach has generated attractive returns. Over the trailing 10 years through April 2014, the fund's S&P 500 Pure Value Index benchmark outpaced the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 Value Index, which tracks the cheaper half of the S&P 500 Index, by 4.6% annualized. However, part of this performance gap may be due to differences in market capitalization. Because the pure value index does not weight its holdings by market cap, it tends to have a smaller-cap tilt. For instance, the average market cap of its holdings ($19.6 billion) is currently only a fraction of the corresponding figure for the S&P 500 Value Index ($70.1 billion). During the past decade, the S&P 500 Pure Value Index outpaced the Russell Midcap Value Index by a more modest, but still respectable, 1.2% annualized.Value stocks have historically outperformed their growth counterparts in nearly every market studied over long time horizons. Because of its deeper value tilt, RPV may be able to capture this premium more effectively than its peers. Its disciplined rebalancing approach also helps. When it rebalances annually in December, the fund increases its exposure to stocks that have become cheaper relative to their peers and trims its exposure to stocks that have become more expensive. These disciplined bets against the market may allow RPV to more effectively capture the mean reversion behind the value effect. However, they may also cause it to overweight stocks with deteriorating fundamentals, which can increase risk.The S&P 500 Pure Value Index was about 33% more volatile than the Russell Midcap Value Index over the past decade. It has also tended to underperform during market downturns. In 2008, it lagged the Russell Midcap Value and S&P 500 Value Indexes by 9.4% and 8.7%, respectively. However, this fund may be a suitable satellite holding for investors with a strong risk tolerance."
Apple: Yes To iBeats And Yes To Paid Music Streaming,May.10.14,"Many are confused, skeptical, and worried about Tim Cook's latest move of acquiring Beats By Dre. I can only say that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not overpaying for Dr. Dre's Beats Electronics. The $3.2 billion offer is just right for the world's biggest luxury headphone vendor. Beats Electronics was estimated to have hit $1 billion sales by 2012. By 2013, the headphone company was rumored to have achieved $1.4 billion in sales.3.2/1.4 = 2.29 P/SOn a Price/Sales basis, this deal is way cheaper and smarter than Facebook's $19 billion buyout of WhatsApp. WhatsApp's estimated 2013 revenue was only $400 million. Beats Electronics was valued $1 billion last year with private equity group Carlyle Group invested $500 million in the company.Premium Headphones, Premium Audio ProductsBeats By Dre is the iPhone of premium headphones. Tim Cook is buying a company that is greatly in line with Apple's high-end, high-margin business mantra. Beats Electronics, like Apple did with the iPhone, created a cult following for its luxury headphones. Beats By Dre is a social status icon that people are eager to own. Beats Electronics leveled-up the entire headphone industry by making $300 headphones a must-have accessory.Beats Electronics, founded in 2006 by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, reached a dominant 64% market share of the $100-and above- headphone sales in 2012. It's safe to assume that Beats By Dre will continue to enjoy its pole position in the headphone industry. Tim Cook won't be gambling $3.2 billion for Beats if he thinks HTC was right in selling its majority stake in the company.It wasn't because Beats Electronics is a hyped-up company selling a fad product. HTC was hemorrhaging losses so it had to sell its stake in Beats. Cook understands the future potential and synergy that Beats By Dre offers to Apple. The audio quality and distinctive sound of Beats Electronics can help Apple's current and future product line. It's not all about headphones/earphones."
T&T Capital Management Q1 Review,"May 15, 2014 7:00 AM ET","I’m pleased to report a strong 1st quarter start for T&T Capital Management (OTCQB:TTCM), with total account gains of 3.25% in the quarter, versus 1.81% for the S&P 500. Cumulatively from January 1, 2012, TTCM is now up 81.82% versus 55.57% for the S&P 500. It is very important to not pay too much attention to the performance of any one quarter, or any one year. We take a much longer-term perspective in our investments; the value of our investment proposition will only be adequately seen in a five year time horizon, which allows for a variety of market cycles. It is important to highlight this when our performance is significantly better than the market, to build the proper expectations that there will assuredly be periods of underperformance in the future.The key is buying securities of businesses that we know and understand, at deep discounts to their intrinsic value. We have little control over the timing of when the undervaluation will correct itself; by only buying securities that have a large margin of safety, we believe we are positioning ourselves to maximize growth at the least risk possible. At TTCM, we concern ourselves most with the risk of permanent losses of capital, as opposed to volatility risk, which we make far less effort to minimize because it is generally counterproductive to long-term investment returns to try and reduce it. We utilize strategies such as cash-secured puts and covered calls to generate income and reduce the risk in the portfolio. These options have been very profitable thus far in 2014 and because many are long-term in nature, we should benefit as time continues to elapse. Investors should take comfort that unlike being only long stock, by selling the cash-secured puts, we can often generate attractive returns even in a flat to slightly down market."
ARM Holdings Share Price Has Likely Peaked,Feb. 4.14,"ARM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:ARMH) ended 2013 in great shape. The stock had hit an all time high and ended the year at almost $55 a share and those investors smart enough to see its future in 2009 and had the foresight to buy some stock below $10 a share had netted over five times their money in a scant 4 years. We should all be so lucky.Since that time, ARM Holdings (""ARM"") stock has lost $9 a share or almost a fifth of its value. What went wrong?Part of the answer is the market beginning to recognize that smart connected device growth has pretty well run its course with most markets approaching maturity with big players like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) struggling to show profit growth in recent quarters. Part of it is simply that ARM is an expensive company with a market capitalization of $21 billion on sales of around $1 billion.Source: ARM Holdings Inc.ARM sees its future as tied not just to growth in smart connected devices but also to the Internet of Things (IOT), an area that it expects to show explosive growth in the next few years. ARM's December 18, 2013 presentation regarding the IoT opportunity is worth a read. ARM presented a forecast by IHS showing unit volumes of smart devices reaching 4.5 billion by 2017 with each device representing a potential application for an ARM Cortex-M processor. ARM also indicated that it expected to be able to supply a Cortex-M processor for less than $0.30."
Hewlett-Packard Future Prospects Post-Split,Oct.13.14,"Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) announced on October 6 that it would be splitting into two companies. One portion of the company will be devoted to PCs and printers, and the other portion will be focused on hardware and software production and services. Meg Whitman will become CEO of the hardware/software producer which will be known as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. The PC and printer business will become HP Inc. and will be headed by Dion Weisler, the executive vice president of the PC and printer side of HPQ. The split will create two roughly equally sized companies based on Q3 2014 revenues of $27.5 billion for the company, close to $14 billion in revenue for each segment.The split creates interesting possibilities for some of the projects at HPQ. Meg Whitman has been planning on formulating a 3D printing division at HPQ. Getting into 3D printing would mesh well with the HPQ current 2D printing model of supplying both printers and printing materials. The printing division brought in $5.6 billion over the last quarter, roughly 20% of the company's revenue. From a management standpoint, 3D printing looks like a natural extension of 2D printing that HPQ could use to supply printers and materials. In 2010, HPQ actually had an agreement with Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) to have HP-licensed 3D printers manufactured. These nearly $18,000 printers weren't exactly what the masses wanted, and the partnership dissolved in 2012. Later in 2013 it was speculated that HPQ would again enter the 3D printing arena, with a new commitment that could shake up the 3D printing world. Meg Whitman even announced in March of 2014 that the company would outline the 3D printing blueprint in June of 2014, and reveal new technology. However June has since come and gone without any such 3D printing announcement from HPQ. Martin Fink, the director of HP labs, later stated that HPQ would instead make a technology announcement on October 31 of 2014, the end of their fiscal year. It might seem there are some internal difficulties concerning the HPQ development of 3D printing, or that HPQ is being very secretive about progress."
It's Time To Sell Hewlett-Packard Bonds,Oct. 7.14,"On Monday, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) announced plans to separate into two publicly traded companies. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will have the enterprise technology infrastructure and software and services businesses. HP Inc. will have the personal systems and printing businesses. While equity investors debate the merits of splitting the company in two, debt investors are left with questions unanswered.In its press release (linked above), Hewlett-Packard didn't provide details on how it plans to divide up its debt and cash. Instead, it simply stated, ""Both companies will be well capitalized and expect to have investment grade credit ratings and capital structures optimized to reflect their distinct growth opportunities and cash flow profiles."" In other words, Hewlett-Packard provided no details on what the capital structures will look like.What we do know is perhaps best summarized in the Moody's Rating Action, placing Hewlett-Packard on review for a downgrade. In that release, Moody's Richard Lane noted, ""post-spin the remaining businesses will be smaller and less diverse and consequently will have a weaker business profile.""Despite Hewlett-Packard currently having a good liquidity profile, I think it's time to sell the company's bonds (not short the bonds, just sell long positions). The one exception is for bondholders with CUSIPs expiring before the end of next year. Those bonds are likely to mature and/or be paid off before the split occurs, or very shortly thereafter. At this time, the bonds are reacting as if there's been no news. Investors seem to be taking a wait-and-see attitude. And that gives other investors a great chance to sell. If you contemplate the potential upside left in the bonds versus the potential downside if Hewlett-Packard's debt and cash aren't allocated favorably for senior unsecured bondholders, it makes sense to sell now and move your money elsewhere."
How Hewlett-Packard Plans For The Future,Oct. 7.14,"Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ) deciding to split into two different ventures, HP Enterprise and HP Inc., comes as a great shock to the tech community. Long considered the biggest name in PC and printer sales, HP has been in a long decline as mobile devices, tablets, and cloud computing became the new world order for businesses and individuals. HP under former CEO Mark Hurd tried to keep up by acquiring companies like Compaq in the bet that HP's size and financial stability, in conjunction with buying smaller but similar companies, would keep costs under control and HP products competitive.Unfortunately, the acquisitions didn't prevent HP from continually losing sales, and has left current CEO Meg Whitman with the risky choice of splitting the company into two in an attempt to keep the brand name relevant. A risky move for a typically conservative businesswoman, Whitman's strategy signals the need to change course from the ""five year plan"" she had brought to the company in 2011, as well as recognition that under the current business model, HP will not be able to get back to their mid-90s heyday. By splitting the company into hardware (HP Inc) and software entities (HP Enterprises), each can do its own thing without pulling the other one down, a common issue of being too big.Why Whitman wants the EnterpriseWhitman's tenure as CEO of HP can be characterized as an attempt to be as forward thinking as possible in regard to the future of the company. She was brought on as a problem solver, and immediately went to work trying to reverse HP's fortunes. However, the expected turnaround point was supposed to come this year, but declining sales and loss of market share have stymied that. Splitting the company had to be done because the PC and printer unit, HP's bread and butter, were lagging, and the push into software and cloud computing was clearly the main focus of HP's future."

Emphasis is on company fundamentals and financial data rather than commentary.In the technology sector, bigger is not necessarily better. Rather, ingenuity and uniqueness can sometimes propel a smaller company forward in ways that make its larger competitors' jaws drop open.The Diversified Computer Systems industry teaches us precisely that, as we see a small but highly evolved tech rodent taking on a colossal but antiquated tech dinosaur and outperforming it remarkably. And it's all because of the rodent's place in the technology tree, on a branch called ""big data.""Just what is big data, anyway? Dictionary.com defines it as:Data sets, typically consisting of billions or trillions of records, that are so vast and complex that they require new and powerful computational resources to process.These new ""computational resources"" required to collect, store and process big data are very much in demand at the moment and will be so for years to come, as social media companies and online retailers (just to mention two communities) are continually amassing greater and greater collections of data on their members and shoppers, and are needy of fast and efficient ways of handling it all. Biotechnology companies, especially those dealing with human and animal genomes, are also in great need of such data-crunching technology.So when a small upstart like the third largest company in the Diversified Computer Systems industry - Cray Inc. (NASDAQ: CRAY) - comes up with equipment and software that is especially designed for bid data, you can be sure its stock will be in just as much demand as its products and services, as noted in the graph below."
Xplore Technologies: A Record Quarter Ahead And Why It Can Dominate The Rugged Tablet Market Long-Term,Dec.19.14,"IntroductionXplore Technologies (NASDAQ:XPLR) is engaged in the development, integration and the marketing of rugged tablet computer systems. XPLR's tablets are designed for commercial use and are able to withstand hazardous conditions, like extreme temperatures, driving rain, repeated vibrations or dirt and dust. Rugged tablet computer systems are continuing to become more and more important throughout various sectors and XPLR is already selling its products to the U.S. military and industry leaders in telecommunication, oil & gas, transportation and pharmaceutical. The following table depicts some key financials of XPLR.(Source: Quarterly Report - Q2FY2015)XPLR is currently a micro-cap with a valuation of $53 million and with great potential for growth. The business is financed solidly with a current ratio of 4.9, no debt and no preferred shares outstanding. Besides that, the majority of the assets on the balance sheet are current assets because XPLR is manufacturing its tablets through Wistron Corporation, their primary contract manufacturer located in Taiwan, which is a leading provider of computers and electronic components to some of the world's largest technology companies, including Dell and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ). Therefore, no investment in expensive manufacturing infrastructure is necessary and scaling production volume is not a problem."
IBM: Worth $260 Per Share,Jun. 3.14,"International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been in the doldrums lately. Now the stock is awfully cheap. It is time to see if it deserves its low valuation or if at its current price it is a screaming buy.IBM's stock valuation is rather similar to Deere & Company (NYSE:DE), which I recently wrote about. Both companies are in the midst of negative revenue growth and transitional times. Both are doing a good job of keeping earnings fairly strong despite their growth challenges. Both stocks are valued similarly. And both companies have been in existence for a very long time.In the case of DE, we can be pretty sure that demand will eventually pick up. IBM's case may be trickier to forecast.In this article, I will first look at IBM's valuation using common metrics, and I'll follow it up with a comparison to two of IBM's peers: Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ).Discounted Cash Flow [DCF] ValuationThe average estimate, as shown on Yahoo Finance, for IBM's next five years' EPS growth is 8.68%. Using that figure for five years, followed by 5% for the next 20 years, and plugging in a discount rate of 10% gives us a Fair Value price of $250.93.I feel that the five years' growth of 8.68% may be optimistic given IBM's current woes, so I'll run another calculation based on 7.5% in the next five years (all other inputs are the same). Re-running the calculation results in my conservative Fair Value of $239.13.The DCF Fair Value calculation is only as accurate as its inputs, so it is important to weigh the odds of IBM living up to the growth rates that I have assumed. With the conservative five-year estimate of 7.5%, I feel comfortable that IBM can reach that EPS growth. The figure is well under IBM's historical growth and 1% less than the average analyst estimate."
Intel: Big Winner In The War Between Chromebooks And Cheap Windows Notebooks,Oct.23.14,"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) sold 15 million tablets in Q3 2014. However, the company's mobile chip division posted another $1.04 billion in operating loss for Q3. While the management is promising significant reduction in contra revenue next year, x86 mobile chips will remain a money-losing enterprise. It is therefore welcome news that Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) decided to use an Intel Celeron N2840 for the latest version of its Chromebook 2. Previous versions of Samsung's Chromebooks used tARM-based Exynos processors. Samsung's decision to use an x86 processor is a long-term tailwind for Intel. Tablet sales growth is slowing down but Chromebooks are rapidly gaining popularity. Gartner estimated that tablet sales only grew 11% in Q3 2014, which is far lower than the 55% growth it posted in the same period last year. ABI Research says Chromebook sales grew 67% in Q3 2014. Gartner estimates that more than 5 million Chromebooks will be sold this year, more than 70% greater than the units sold last year. Yes, the tablet market is much bigger than Chromebooks right now. However, Intel is losing big money in its quest to sell 40 million tablet chips this year. Chromebook sales are therefore more beneficial to Intel than tablets are right now. Thanks to Intel's strong support, sub-$250 Chromebooks are now proliferating in the market. Samsung is selling the Intel-powered 11.6-inch Chromebook 2 for $249.99 - $50 cheaper than its previous Exynos-powered Chromebook 2.Cheaper Intel-Powered ChromebooksThe lower price tag of the Intel-powered Samsung Chromebook 2 might help the South Korean company regain its position as the world's top vendor of Chromebooks. Samsung posted 64.9% market share in Chromebook sales in 2013. However, low-priced Intel Celeron and Atom processors helped other OEMs come out with cheaper Chromebooks this year."
"IBM - Change Won't Happen Overnight, But Will In Due Time",Oct.24.14,"International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) announced their third-quarter 2014 earnings. It was disappointing since their revenues and earnings are declining. IBM is transitioning their business model to higher value added products and services. Before, their revenues primarily came from hardware sales, which were significantly lower margins businesses.I wouldn't classify IBM has a turnaround, but the business model is definitely changing. The world is changing and IBM has to constantly adapt due to the rapid advances in technology. Let's see what IBM is up to nowadays. IBM recently presented their strategy and financial model for 2014. This was on Sept. 8, 2014. I found it quite interesting.The New FocusIBM is focus on three areas in the market: data, cloud and engagement. Everything we do nowadays is very data dependent. Businesses rely on data to better interact with customers. Before, data was mined and stored. Now, it's being analyze and qualify to better improve processes.

Good examples of data as a competitive advantage are Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN) and Verisk Analytics (NASDAQ:VRSK). They have hoarded tremendous quantities of data.

That means I not only got Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), but I also got stuck with the likes of J.C. Penney and Emery Air Freight.And no, I haven't forgotten about the outrageous commissions that brokers charged back then. Erring on the side of ""Yikes!"" let's say each trade cost $100. That means my total investment on September 23, 1974 would have been $55,000.We now know that Polaroid and Kodak stock went on to be worthless. Other eventual losers included Sears and Schlitz. Still others, such as Gillette and Anheuser-Busch, changed materially through mergers or acquisitions.But here's the deal: There were some pretty nifty survivors, too.Defining The Nifty FiftyThe Nifty Fifty was not an actual index like the Dow Jones Industrials or the S&P 500; it was a moniker attached to a collection of major, publicly-traded corporations in the 1970s. The exact composition of the Nifty Fifty remains a little murky, but the Morgan Guaranty Trust list seems to be the most-quoted standard.Curiously, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), which I will discuss more later, wasn't on that list. It was part of a 50-stock group designated by Kidder Peabody, and some market historians actually prefer that version of the Nifty Fifty. (Ironically, neither Morgan Guaranty Trust nor Kidder Peabody exist today.)"
"Watch Out Apple, Xiaomi Is Coming To Each One Of Your Segments",Nov.17.14,"Chinese tech company Xiaomi is a rising star in the consumer electronics world, considered by many to be the next big thing out of China. In the last few years, many Chinese companies have stepped outside of mainland China and started threatening the world dominance of giant Western companies. A few examples include Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), which threatens Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the search market; Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which threatens Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the eCommerce market and PayPal (NASDAQ:EBAY) in the electronic payments market; Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), which threatens Dell, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the PC business; and the list goes on to almost every sector.In the consumer electronics, specifically the smartphone market, many Chinese companies have tried to threaten Apple's and Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) dominance, but couldn't quite make it. Lenovo, Huawei, ZTE (OTCPK:ZTCOF) and many others offered low-cost smartphones and tablets, but could not push Apple and Samsung from their leadership positions worldwide. Can Xiaomi's effort be more successful than other Chinese attempts? Should Apple and Samsung really be concerned about Xiaomi, or is it just a local phenomenon in China?Xiaomi was founded four years ago by Chinese tech entrepreneur Lei Jun as a smartphone vendor and released its first Android-based firmware named MIUI shortly after. In August 2011, Xiaomi launched its first smartphone, the Mi1, which was nicknamed the Chinese iPhone and received more than 300,000 pre-orders, making it an immediate success for the company. The Mi1's success was driven by its attractive low price, which offered the Chinese middle class the opportunity to own a high-end product at an affordable price. Following the Mi1's success, Xiaomi used the same pricing strategy for its next-generation smartphones and managed to replicate the Mi1's success, increasing the number of phones shipped every quarter."
A Look At The SSD Market: Where Do Seagate And Western Digital Stand?,Dec. 5.14,"Hard drive manufacturers Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NYSE:WDC) face an uphill battle in attempting to sustain sales of traditional rotating-disk drives in the coming years. Since the introduction of flash-based memory chips, there have been constant talks about how long it will be before hard disk drives eventually become obsolete. NAND-flash based storage, or solid state drives (SSD), have numerous advantages over rotating-disk drives, ranging from the sheer speed of read/write operations, low latency in data access, relatively low power consumption, as well as lighter and more durable drives with a greater resistance to mechanical shock. So why hasn't there been an industry-wide switch to solid state drives already?It all comes down to the price. Traditional storage drives currently cost around 7 to 8 cents per usable gigabyte, whereas even the best-priced SSDs cost over $0.40 per usable gigabyte. However, it is interesting to note that SSD prices have been falling drastically in the last few years as demand has picked up. Prices are likely to continue to drop in the coming years, thereby posing a major threat to hard drive makers such as Seagate and Western Digital. In this article we take a look at the presence of NAND-flash chip makers in the SSD market and how the drop in SSD prices could impact them.How Costly Are SSDs Really?In dollar terms, solid state drives are over 5 times more expensive than hard disk drives (HDD) on average, as mentioned earlier. However, there are two points of note here. First, SSD prices are falling at a significantly higher rate than HDDs. [1] Although this does not imply that SSDs could become cheaper than HDDs anytime soon, it should certainly make purchasing a solid state drive more justifiable. Secondly and more importantly, SSDs aren't all that expensive if the price per gigabyte per second is measured - a metric which could be a more comprehensive point of comparison of cost vs. performance. For calculating this metric, the cost to bandwidth ratio, or the sequential read speed (in gigabytes/second), is used against the price of the drive to arrive at price per GB per second."
3M: Increasing Earnings Through Consistent Innovation,Aug. 5.14,"When companies are first born out of an entrepreneur's dream, it is inherently part of the business to take risks. With nothing already established, entrepreneurs seek to innovate, take risks, and make game-changing products. But there are far too many companies that will find success in one niche and then be satisfied with their progress. The company will limit itself, discouraging risk taking and innovation in fear of deviating from what works. If 3M (NYSE: MMM) was one of these self-limiting companies, it would probably be just a small sandpaper products business out of Minnesota. Or maybe it would have shifted its focus to healthcare when that was the dominant segment in the early 2000s. But management at 3M has created a culture that encourages trying new things and expanding into unknown realms, which is the reason why it has become the massively successful industrial conglomerate it is today.A Quick Overview3M is one of the world's largest industrial conglomerates, with a market capitalization of over $90 billion. The company offers a diversified basket of products including adhesives, filtration products, surgical supplies, office supplies, security products, electronic displays, and much more. The division of revenues amongst segments is as follows (with -1.8% from ""Elimination of Dual Credit""):Industrial: 34.3%Safety and Graphics: 18.3%Electronics and Energy: 17.5%Health Care: 17.3%Consumer: 14.4%Game-Changing Company PolicyMany companies are limited by strict bureaucratic policies that punish failure and discourage risk taking. Employees are driven away from trying to be creative in an attempt to maintain their own reputation as well as the company's. 3M is on the opposite end of the spectrum. Back in 1948, the company introduced a policy called 15 Percent Time. It stated that employees were to dedicate 15% of their working time to working on individual projects. Additionally about $750,000 is given out as seed funding each year to employees that have come up with potentially profitable ideas. Seeing that time is money, 3M must've understood that they were essentially gambling 15% of their profits as well as their time by creating this policy, a risk most companies aren't willing to take. But over the long run, this initiative has paid off immensely. For example, a 3M employee named Art Fry spent his 15 Percent Time trying to create the best possible bookmark for his church hymnal. Few people would have expected that to turn into Post-it notes, one of the company's most globally recognized products. Is this to say that the 15 Percent Time is always used to come up with groundbreaking products? Of course not, but 3M embraces failure as the path to an eventual success. If you fail nine times and succeed on the tenth, you're still a success. Additionally, this policy draws some of the world's most talented scientists and engineers toward 3M, as they know that their creative ideas won't be suppressed. This has led to 3M continually growing and dominating hundreds, if not thousands, of much smaller companies that compete with them in numerous product markets. This idea of personal creative time has been emulated by other fantastic companies such as Google and Hewlett-Packard."
Apple's iPhone Sales Are Surging While Samsung's Sales Are Sinking,Oct.21.14,"Although we do not always agree with former hedge fund manager and CNBC stock market personality Jim Cramer, we agree with his conclusion that investors should own shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and not try to ""time trading in and out of it."" Furthermore, we believe investors should carefully accumulate shares of the company. Last year, Apple had a mediocre year financially and it had to deal with Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) being the golden boy of the investment community as well as the mobile technology marketplace. This year, Apple has seen its iPhone sales rates recover as consumers seemed to have forgiven its missteps with the iPhone 5 product. Between Apple getting its growth groove back and its willingness to reward shareholders' patience with dividends and share repurchases, it is no wonder why Apple's shares generated an 85% total return since bottoming out in April 2013. Meanwhile, Samsung is seeing its revenues and profits start to sag as the iPhone continues its dominance in the high-end smartphone segment while Chinese brands cut into its low-end business.Source: Apple's Supplemental Financial Report"
Intel: A Strong Buy For The Long-Term Investor,Jun.11.14,"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has recently been posting new 52-week highs. The small run-ups are not due to gimmicks but a gradual increase in investor confidence. Yes, Intel has been stuck for the last 10 years. However, this old dividend aristocrat dog is showing the world it can still learn new tricks.It is ruthlessly extending its proprietary x86 micro architecture to wearables, mobile gadgets, and micro mini computers.Source: MorningstarIntel's big operating losses on its mobile chip division make it look like a fumbling amateur. However, in my own assessment, the company is just being merciless in its quest of keeping its x86 kingdom safe. Contra revenue is a very effective tool to keep all Intel's competition bleed in lost sales and lower profit margins.We are in the 2nd half of 2014 and June has seen INTC breach new 52-week price points. Intel might finally break out of its tepid performance. $28.40 is just a small step away from $30."
FireEye And VMware: A Marriage Made For The Clouds,Aug.26.14,"Merger mania is upon us! Look around and you will find a lot of twitchy fingers among large-cap CEOs. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Coke (NYSE:KO) are only a few in the game of throwing big money at large acquisitions. As the lure of cheap returns from share buybacks fade, more organizations will be looking to spruce up their returns through inorganic growth with inflated stock currencies. As long as the S&P index keeps pushing higher, all these big players have no option but to act ever more dramatically.FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) has been on my radar for sometime and not always for the same reasons. Today, I am taking a different tact on this stock for a few key reasons:The stock has been massacred from unbelievable levels making its valuation more palatable.The company is burning through money quite rapidly and will end up diluting its shareholders, either through more debt or secondary stock offerings.VMware (NYSE:VMW) has shown the determination to vertically integrate its business model across the data center market.VMware has a strong balance sheet and will be increasingly aggressive in protecting its offerings by complementing it with additional services.Security is the hottest play in the networking industry today.HistoryVMW shook up the networking industry with the purchase of a well-known Silicon Valley startup, Nicira. Nicira was one of the pioneers of the Software Defined Network (SDN) bandwagon and though they were not doing terribly well at the time of the buyout, VMW stepped in and bought the company at an eye popping $1.05 billion valuation.Things began to heat up when VMW started getting a lot of pressure on its level on integration with the network ecosystem and they were not getting the quick turnaround from network equipment vendors to solve their data center automation requirements. At that point VMW decided to take on the challenge by buying out a network solution that best fit their requirements. It also enabled them to offer solutions that stood on its own in terms of automated deployment models and undercut the network equipment vendor's deployment model. This was achieved by enabling the SDN model where the physical network layer is bypassed using an overlay technology. The new model put very little requirements on the underlying physical network and empowered the data center managers to deploy and manage new servers and applications in the data center with minimal human intervention."
Update: Crossroads Sued By Quantum Corporation,Sep.30.14,"We have covered Crossroads Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CRDS) for a while now, including articles wherein we value the company at $20 per share and where we breakdown the bullish insider trading. As such, we feel it necessary to provide info surrounding the recent lawsuit against Crossroads.The SuitCrossroads Systems Inc. was sued recently by Quantum Corporation (NYSE:QTM) for Willful Patent Infringement. Quantum claims that Crossroads willfully infringed on United States Patent No. 6,766,412 (short-hand referred to as the '412 patent) filed by Quantum in July of 2004. They accuse StrongBox, Crossroads' main product, as having incorporated this technology.The PatentThe '412 patent deals with ""Data Storage Media Library with Scalable Throughput Rate for Data Routing and Protocol Conversion"", according to the filing. Essentially, what the patent claims is a digital storage unit that comprises of:A multiplicity of storage media slots with each storage slot specified for receiving a media unitA plurality of storage media units loaded in each of storage media slotsA plurality of data transfer devices embedded within each of the storage media unitsA plurality of interfacing devices for connecting the embedded system of multiple data transfer devices within multiple storage media units within multiple storage media slots within each digital storage systemA loader mechanism for selectively transferring data intra-systemStrongBoxThe product specifically under question is the StrongBox VSeries Library Solution. The StrongBox VSeries Library Solution combines the StrongBox network-attached storage (NAS) appliance with a StrongBox VSeries tape library.

Workday: The Risks And Opportunities,Dec. 2.14,"Since its public offering in 2012, Workday (NYSE:WDAY) stock climbed more than 100%, from its $50 beginning to the high of $115. Workday's growth was spurred by the belief in the strength of its enterprise resource planning software, which would allow the company to achieve rapid and sustained growth. Since its highest peak, the stock nearly halved in value, and is currently trading in the $79 range. There are a number of threats and opportunities for the company, however, and of course there is no certainty as to what the future might hold for its investors.New Apps Could Under-DeliverSo far, Workday has done exceptional job in building cloud-based enterprise resource planning software that integrates with its other offerings. Currently, the company is in the process of building new applications for managing the workplace, while pushing into completely new environment. The new application suite will be doing the task of supplying businesses with predictive data and recommendations for management, and would also be able to map out employee performance analysis, career path suggestions and more. While there is great potential for the new apps, if the company does not perform up to standard, the result could be a further decline for Workday's stock. There are also a number of competing companies in the same industry of predictive management solutions, which could make it difficult for Workday to stand out in the crowd.Missing Growth TargetsThe company's stock is currently price at 22.4 times trailing 12-month sales, with it being heavily dependent on revenue growth and expectations. While Workday did manage to build sales over the past couple of years, the total expenditures have also risen due to the acquisitions and expansion costs."
"Neonode: Strong Sell On Shell Games, Fraud Litigation And Hyping Obsolete Technology",Jun.18.14,"Neonode (NASDAQ:NEON) is a reverse merger that traded for $0.50 per share on the OTC market just a few years ago, that has gone bankrupt twice already. With promises of future revenue, 160 promotional press releases and questionable ties to an alleged paid stock promotion scandal, NEON now trades at an eye-popping ""bubble valuation"" of $153m, despite just $4.3m of trailing 12-month revenue, which is a -31% decline from 2011 revenue.Most importantly, Swedish court documents show NEON executive Chairman faces fraud allegations from profiting off of the sale of a shell company that went bankrupt and wiped the investors out. This, along with the multiple bankruptcies of Neonode in the past paints an interesting pattern to me.NEON has consistent cash burn, and has only survived thus far due to consistently issuing dilutive equity to fund cash needs. Primary industry research shows current contracts are not generating material revenue, while NEON's fundamentals are rapidly deteriorating due to obsolete and commoditized ""technology"". I expect as NEON's story continues to come unwound, NEON will need to continue issuing an increasingly large number of shares, diluting shareholders in an accelerating manner, to fund its cash burn."
Avago Technologies: Don't Ignore These Catalysts,Aug.29.14,"Avago technologies (NASDAQ: AVGO) is the ninth largest semiconductor company, and it belongs to the industry of broad line semiconductors. The company is headquartered in San Jose, California and Singapore. Avago designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor devices; primarily III-V based products. III-V refers to elements of third and fifth group of the periodic table.

An Exercise In Valuation: Oracle,Oct. 8.14,"There seems to be a lot of confusion still out there on the difference between a fair value estimate and a price target. A fair value estimate is a calculation of intrinsic value on the basis of a company's future free cash flows. It is grounded in financial analysis and solidified through a reasonable basis. A price target, on the other hand, can be based on animal spirits and be disconnected from a company's intrinsic worth. We think intrinsic value estimates are much more informative. Let's calculate an intrinsic value estimate for Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) in this article.Oracle's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Oracle's business quality (an evaluation of our ValueCreation and ValueRisk ratings) ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively.

The Evolution Of Storage: From Hard Disk Drives To Resistive RAM,"Oct. 22, 2014 11:55 AM ET","By Chris Burniske, ARK AnalystIn 1956 when IBM (NYSE:IBM) shipped the world's first hard disk drive (HDD),1 it cost $59,095/MB in 2013 dollars, and in 1988 Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shipped its first flash memory2 chip for an inflation adjusted $1,260/MB. Today the latest evolution of storage, resistive RAM (RRAM), sells for $34.50/MB, a much more affordable starting point. As shown below, given the inflation adjusted price histories of HDD and flash memory, RRAM will not stay at $34.50/MB for long.RRAM's unique characteristics include extremely high density, speed and energy efficiency. Combined, in time they should create completely new products. HDDs and flash memory did the same in creating their respective markets, minicomputers/PCs and mobile devices. But the RRAM evolution will take time as, per megabyte, it is currently 70,000 times and 700,000 times more expensive than flash and HDDs respectively.3Since their introduction in 1956, HDDs have enabled the modern computer era. They quickly displaced magnetic tape in the early 1960s thanks to faster access times. Since then, HDDs have created disruption continuously, as trumpeted by Clayton Christensen in Disruptive Innovation. The cause of this disruption was the disk (or platter) size, which shrank from 24 inches to 1.8 in six stages. Despite the smaller form HDDs initially being slower, more expensive and capacity constrained compared to pre-existing larger-form HDDs, they inevitably displaced their predecessors. Why? Because they enabled new architectures that made the computer accessible to a much wider audience.For example, in the late 1970s 8-inch HDDs accelerated the adoption of more user-friendly minicomputers over relatively inaccessible mainframe computers. The latter required high capacity 14-inch HDDs as well as specialized rooms, technicians and heavy capital outlays. The initial cost/MB of 8-inch HDDs was higher than their 14-inch predecessors, but because of their small size they cost less and gave rise to minicomputers, supplanting the demand for many mainframes."
Hortonworks IPO Uncovers Little Revenues And Great Potential For The Hadoop Company,Nov.14.14,"Big data software developer Hortonworks (Pending:HDP) filed for an IPO this week, uncovering its financials for the first time and allowing a first glance into the financial aspects of the Hadoop market. Hortonworks is a big data software development specializing in the Hadoop environment and offers organizations Hadoop-based solutions to optimize data processing and storage. Hortonworks is one of the main players in the Hadoop market, together with Cloudera and MapR Technologies.Hadoop is an open-source software framework for distributed storage and distributed processing of big data on clusters of commodity hardware. Hadoop optimizes data processing and enables organizations to better utilize their databases and save storage costs. The Hadoop software market is relatively new, as the two market leaders were founded only a few years ago: Cloudera in 2009 and Hortonworks in 2011.Hortonworks started from within Yahoo (YHOO) and spun out in 2011 to create an independent company backed by Yahoo and Benchmark capital, both of which are still the biggest shareholders with 19.6% and 18.7% of the total shares.Hortonworks generates revenue primarily under multiple-element arrangements that include support subscription offerings combined with consulting and/or training services. A significant portion of Hortonworks revenue has been concentrated among a relatively small number of large customers.

The Long Case For Marin Software,Dec. 5.14,"(Editors' Note: This article was submitted in October as an entry in the Harvard/Seeking Alpha Stock-pitching competition held on Nov. 8, 2014).By George Liu, Matt Chen, Wina Huang, Harris Shabbir, and Lion FundInvestment Thesis:Amidst the premium multiples many companies in the technology sector are trading at today, Marin Software is an undiscovered gem with an astounding asymmetric risk/reward profile. Trading at a significant discount to peers, we believe that there have been a few key events affecting the company over the past year that the market has overreacted to. As a result, we feel the market has had a very narrow focused view on the company, and has been ignoring the larger picture. In the larger picture Marin Software has witnessed unprecedented support from venture capital firms and exhibited high revenue retention rates, both indicators of its continued operating strength. Most notably, Marin Software’s acquisition of Perfect Audience in June 2014 and its partnership with Yandex in September 2014 will allow the company to simultaneously expand its geographic standing and its product offerings. This dual focus will allow the company to extensively increase its market share, and thereby improve shareholder value. We have a one year price target of $14.91, providing an upside of 70.99%.Company History:Marin Software is a leading provider of software for managing digital advertising spend that works with 23% of Fortune 500 companies. The Company was founded in April, 2006 by Christopher Lien, Wister Walcott, and Joseph Chang, who currently serve as Executive Chairman, Executive Vice President of Products and Professional Services, and Chief Technology Officer respectively.Following his work at an online ad firm in 2005, Lien realized the lack of viable software to help search advertisers manage their online campaigns. Marin Search Marketer debuted in April 2007, and the Company has since expanded operations in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Marin Software went public on March 22, 2013 at $14 per share, with the IPO raising a total of $105 million at a valuation of $425 million. The Company currently trades on NYSE under the ticker MRIN."
Hewlett-Packard In Charts: Long-Term Performance Looks Patchy,Feb.19.15,"My piece ""Hewlett-Packard - three spreadsheet tables, and the quality of cash flow"" shows the data the charts are based on. The formulas are in my 'build the spreadsheet' pieces, ""Build the big HP spreadsheet and ""Build the HP Operating Cash Flow growth spreadsheet"".Revenue and earnings, in millions:Assets, liabilities and equity, in millions:'Per share' chartsMy reason for using 'Shares calculated from EPS' is that HP (NYSE:HPQ) disclosed EPS adjusted for stock splits, but not an adjusted number of shares. I use 'Shares calculated from EPS' later to get figures for Operating cash flow per share (adjusted for stock splits). The number of shares is adjusted for the stock splits in 1995 and 1996, but not for 2000. I then used an adjustment factor for the 2000 split only, when I calculated split-adjusted values for dividend, cash flow per share, etc. (Find ""build"" for a link with the formulas.) It's complicated but the smoothly rising adjusted dividend means I probably got it right."
Is The Printer/PC Unit Spin-Off By Hewlett-Packard A Bad Idea?,Feb. 4.15,"While many businesses I follow of late, including Energizer (NYSE:ENR) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), have decided 2015 is a good time to divest and spin off large ""unrelated"" business units into separate publicly traded companies, not all spin-offs are a good idea in the long run.Case in point is the decision announced October 6, 2014 by Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) to split the company in two, largely to jettison the lower-margin Printer and Personal Computer (PC) units from the higher-margin services business. I am here to argue it is a bad idea. This is coming from someone who has owned shares off and on over the last several years, when Wall Street wrote HPQ off as dead money. The fully integrated model, including the Printer and PC divisions, is a major selling point for businesses and consumers like myself. You can review my bullish HP article on Seeking Alpha from October 2013 here, when the stock price was closer to $20 a share.Thank goodness the company is keeping the steady cash flow generation from the Printer and PC units in a single entity versus rumors of selling the personal computer business only. I own mostly Hewlett-Packard products at home, and they work seamlessly together. I have a 5-year old desktop PC that works great, a 3-year old netbook, a newer Officejet Pro printer and recently bought a cheap and light Stream gadget for browsing the internet anywhere in the house. They all operate wirelessly and send print files to the Officejet Pro with no issues, beyond user errors. It's the same reason I own matching Sony (NYSE:SNE) televisions, blu-rays and DVD players throughout the house."

This deal signals the company's ongoing intent to become a prominent player in the rapidly growing wireless campus networking space. In the last five years it has purchased wireless solution providers Colubris, 3Com and now Aruba Networks. Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald, said in a research report Monday.Given HPQ's bigger push into the networking market over the past few years that included the ($2.7 billion) acquisition of 3Com in 2010, we believe the planned acquisition of Aruba Networks complements HPQ's existing networking portfolio."
Computer Sciences Corp: Activist Jana Partners Working Another LBO,Feb.26.15,"Per a SEC filing on Monday, Jana Partners owns right at 5.9% of Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC). This comes after the fund increased its stake by 3x since the end of 2014. The majority of its recent share purchases were made between $60 and $63 a share.The stock is now trading upwards of $70/share on buyout speculation and the announcement of Jana's stake. Jana owns shares, noting the stock is undervalued. However, it appears that Jana is more interested in finally getting the company sold, with the activist noting in its SEC filing that it plans on engaging management about strategic alternatives.Is the buyout finally materializing?Shares are at multi-year highs, in fact, we haven't seen these levels since 2000. CSC noted back in September that it was in talks with PE firms to test the market for an LBO. And this isn't the first time that CSC has tried to sell itself, rumors were afoot back in 2006. At the time, shares were around $60, and the reported interested parties included defense contractor Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and PE firms.Now, what makes the recent CSC news somewhat interesting isn't just Jana's involvement, but the fact that there's already new speculation of interested buyers.Specifically, a deal for CSC might look something like this: Its government services business would go to a PE company - or a consortium with a PE partner, given that business can't be owned outright by a foreign party given the Department of Defense is a major customer of the segment. While its other business units that offer cloud and Big Data services to businesses could be of interest to a foreign company.The deal to get rid of the government business has actually been in the works for a couple months. And this would be a positive if the company could get rid of the slower growth business. It is worth noting that this segment is still considered the most valuable given the customer base and relative stability."
"15 Years After Bubble Burst, Tech Stocks Competitively Priced","Mar. 9, 2015 6:03 PM ET","With the Nasdaq composite recently regaining the 5000 mark and with the 15-year anniversary of the Nasdaq's all-time high of 5,048 on March 9, headlines have revolved around how the technology space has changed. Some have even stated that the recent run-up in stock prices puts the technology space in a bigger bubble than in 2000. Despite what many are saying, the current environment does not suggest an impending bubble burst based on key financial metrics.Y2K Tech StocksTaking a look at seven companies that were operating in 2000 and are still around today sheds light on how the space has changed. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) were selected for comparison.

In comparison, PE ratios for these same seven stocks are currently ranging from 13-18. There's no overlap in the two ranges so it's safe to say that as a group, PE ratios are definitely lower today than they were in 2000."
It's Tough To Make A Bearish Case Against Apple,"Feb. 17, 2015 10:33 AM ET","Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is probably the most talked about stock in the investment community. Within those conversations I have heard a lot of negative sentiment about the company and the stock but the arguments seem to be very qualitative. In this article I will take a quantitative approach to see how realistic and profitable bearish expectations are for Apple relative to its peer group.Below is a chart comparing AAPL to ten large caps that can be broadly categorized as technology stocks. The final column is a simple average between these ten companies, excluding Apple, which I will use as a basis for comparison to it.Source: Yahoo FinanceApple generally compares favorably in P/E and EV/EBITDA to Alibaba, Cisco, Facebook, Google, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and Qualcomm when considering stock prices at market close on February 13, 2015. Using forward P/E and EV/EBITDA as a basis, you could reasonably expect AAPL to increase around 15% just to align to the average of its peers. But the metric where Apple really stands out is the PEG Ratio. The PEG Ratio takes the P/E and divides it by the 5-year expected growth rate of a stock's EPS. It's a valuation equalizer between high-growth and low-growth stocks and an easy way to illustrate how stocks like Alibaba and Facebook can trade at P/E ratios of around 30 while IBM trades at less than 10.Apple's PEG Ratio is just 1.16, leading the group of eleven and well under the average PEG Ratio of the other ten at 1.67. Applying a 1.67 PEG Ratio to Apple would imply an increase of 44% to the stock price, or $182.What does a PEG Ratio of 1.16 mean? It's easy to take a number from Yahoo Finance and compare it to other stocks to make a simple conclusion, but investors should be aware of what a 1.16 PEG Ratio implies so they can judge for themselves how realistic this expectation is for the company. The chart below illustrates what Apple's growth trend could look like based on analyst expectations mixed in with my own calculations.At a stock price of $127.08, the P/E ratio for 2015 will be 14.81 if the analyst EPS expectation is met at $8.58. The 5-year annual EPS growth rate is expected to be 12.76%. Dividing 14.81 by 12.76 results in the 1.16 PEG Ratio. The EPS expectation for 2016 is $9.16, which is only a 6.76% growth rate so analysts expect next year to be an off-year for the company despite the 12.76% average annual growth rate from 2016 to 2020.2020's EPS figure can be calculated with the analyst expectations as follows:2020 EPS = 2015 EPS x (1+growth rate) ^ number of years$8.58 x (1.1276)^5 = $15.64EPS figures for 2017 through 2019 and 2021 are my estimates that would fit within the context of these analyst estimates. In order to hit a $15.64 EPS, Apple's EPS needs to grow around 13-15% every year after 2016. Investors need to assess if they think such a target is achievable. If so, then they should be confident in holding the stock to at least $180.Note that for 2016 the PEG Ratio drops to 0.98 assuming a static stock price. The 5-year growth rate is for 2017 to 2021 as the weak growth year of 6.76% drops off. I assumed that the growth rate from 2020 to 2021 remains relatively flat to previous years at 13.48%. That results in a 5-year annual growth rate of 14.15%. Dividing the 13.87 P/E by 14.15 leads to the 0.98 PEG Ratio.If AAPL was to reach $180 by 2016, the PEG Ratio would be 1.39. The stock would have another 20% room to grow before hitting the PEG Ratio of 1.67 to come in line with Apple's peers.The bearish case scenario for Apple based on fundamentalsThe bearish case for Apple is based off the threat that the company will get complacent, particularly for the iPhone. Smartphone margins will decline, Apple will lose market share or the replacement purchase cycle will slow as wireless companies have been moving away from subsidy models to handset financing models. Fair enough, one could argue that expectations of a 13-15% growth rate every year for a company as large as Apple is going to be a challenge to maintain. Here is the same chart as above, with the expected 5-year growth rate at 8%.To put it in perspective, Microsoft's 5-year EPS growth estimate is 8.37% so 8% can be seen as a pretty standard growth expectation for a large consumer technology company. To assume that Apple will grow much slower than that is assuming that a company with a history of innovation, a strong market presence and a large loyal brand following really messes things up.An 8% EPS growth rate expectation for 2016 to 2020 leads to a 1.85 PEG Ratio. Comparing that to the 1.67 average of Apple's peers, that would imply the company is 10% overvalued. A 7.82% EPS growth rate expectation for 2017 to 2021 leads to a 1.77 PEG Ratio, 6% overvalued to its peers.A bullish view of a 12.76% 5-year annual growth rate (that's in line with analyst expectations) points to an upside of 44% this year and an additional 20% next year. A more bearish view of 8% (in line with expectations for Microsoft) points to a downside of 10% this year, with about half of that downside eroding in 2016. Fundamental valuation of Apple points to far more upside than downside.Shorting Apple offers inferior profit potential compared to the risk assumedShorting Apple does not provide a good risk-to-reward investment profile based on the numbers above. The best reason to short Apple in the near-term is if you think the entire market is going to go down. Since Apple makes up such a large component of the market and can be seen as a bellwether stock, any decline in it is going to lead to the market falling as well. I believe it's a better risk trade-off to go long inverse-market ETFs or buy puts on market-tracking ETFs than to short Apple.Since Apple is so large, it could underperform a highly bullish market that rewards small caps that have underperformed large caps for years as they finally catch up. But that doesn't help someone who is shorting Apple. They still lose. And based on the analysis above, there is plenty of reason to expect that Apple could outperform a bull market. In a bear market, Apple will almost certainly outperform the market (lose less) because of its strong cash position and low valuation multiples. So if an investor is bearish on the market, they will probably make more money betting against the market at large than on Apple individually.ConclusionI am not an Apple investor nor am I a big consumer of the company's products (the only Apple devices I've ever had I got for free). With my investing capital limited to my own personal portfolio and being fairly young, I prefer to focus on more aggressive small cap tech stocks with high upside. If I was managing a multi-million dollar fund with a focus on technology stocks, I would definitely invest a portion of that fund into Apple.I don't believe this is a good time for anyone to bet against AAPL as the fundamentals for a short don't start to make sense until it hits at least $180. I wish the stock continues to do well because I believe its success will create a safety net on the market for which bullish positions on smaller tech stocks will benefit. Actually, I don't need to wish anything - my analysis on the stock leads me to believe that it will do just fine in the foreseeable future.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: I have not received any compensation for this article and all opinions reflected herein are my own.

Keysight Technologies: A Cash-Flow Generating Spin-Off,Apr.10.15,"Keysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) provides electronic measurement equipment across industry segments to perform complex electronic design and development. A global company with 64% of its revenues in 2014 outside of the U.S., Keysight possesses roughly 25% market share of the electronic measurement industry and holds leading positions in its end markets, including communications (wireless); aerospace and defense; and industrial, computers and semiconductors. Keysight is a recent spin-off of Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) in 2014 while Keysight and Agilent together were spun off of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) in 1999.Keysight has one of the best margins and return on equity in the business, and on a cash flow basis, is trading below its competitors. The free cash flow yield for its main competitors of National Instruments Corp. (NASDAQ:NATI), Danaher Corp. (NYSE:DHR) and Teradyne (NYSE:TER) are approximately 2.93%, 5.17%, and 7.70%, respectively. Keysight, with low capital expenditures and produces a prodigious amount of free cash flow, is trading at around 8.0% free cash flow yield. Although Teradyne and Keysight have similar yields, Teradyne's free cash flows are erratic and it has a much smaller margin and return on equity than Keysight.The Wireless MarketBefore the spin-off in 2013, Keysight was the electronic measurement division of Agilent, and reported in Q2 of 2013, a 26% decline in wireless manufacturing revenue due to the loss of a business from a large customer. Subsequently, in September 2013, Agilent announced plans to separate into two publicly-traded companies through a spin-off of Keysight or its electronic measurement business. According to the company's presentation, Keysight's cash generation has historically funded Agilent's growth initiatives, and after the spin-off, Keysight's cash flow will be used to drive its own growth rates - the reason for Keysight's spin-off is not because its business has impaired, but rather, Keysight has been underfunded by its own cash flow and most likely caused Keysight to lose the wireless customer in 2013."
"Go, Go, Avago",Feb.19.15,"Avago Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor company, which operates in four segments: Wireless Communications, Wired Infrastructure, Enterprise Storage, and Industrial segments. The company is headquartered in San Jose, California and Singapore. Its corporate roots date back to the 1960s AT&T Bell Labs era and the early Hewlett Packard. Excluding memory companies, it is the 9th largest semiconductor company in the world.Avago is an amazing growth story. In its wireless segment, the primary growth driver is 4G/LTE deployment and infrastructure fueled by the need for more bandwidth. In the wired semi segment, there is the Internet of Things as more and more devices become smart devices. Enterprise storage is benefiting from the Cloud, Social Media, Video Streaming, and Big Data, all of which are experiencing exponential growth and requiring more and more storage capability. Finally, increased factory automation, energy efficiency, and high-speed transport in China are driving strong growth in the Industrial segment.I have been a strong believer in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and have owned the stock for some time. Avago, along with another name I own Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) are derivative supply chain plays on the Apple success story. Both companies stand to benefit from increased RF chip complexity in handset and tablet devices. But Apple isn't Avago's only key customer. In the wireless segment, there is also HTC, LG, and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF). And in its other segments, there are big customers such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), IBM (NYSE:IBM), HP (NYSE:HPQ), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)."
Intel's Leadership In Notebook Processors Is Unchallenged,Jan.22.15,"In spite of its kamikaze approach to win more market share in tablet/smartphone application processors, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) continues to develop more efficient x86 processors for the laptop and PC market. I opine that laptops will remain a strong growth driver for Intel processors in this age of smartphones and tablets.It is therefore smart of Intel to continue coming out with innovative processors that will encourage consumers to continue buying new laptop models. Laptop makers like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), and Dell continues to depend on Intel to deliver evolutionary processors and chipsets that help laptops remain relevant.Intel's processors are finding more OEM buyers, which can be illustrated by the chart below made by Passmark Software. Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) inability to keep up with the engineering and manufacturing ability of Intel is painfully obvious on this chart. AMD is back to outsourcing 28nanometer processors to GlobalFoundries this year.Source: cpubenchmark.netIt's all been downhill for AMD since 2006 when it comes to x86 processors. The upcoming release of its Carrizo APU processors is unlikely to dent Intel's growth in x86 processor sales. Carrizo is another 28-nanometer design that is unlikely to steal the thunder from Intel's 14-nanometer Core M family of mobile processors."
Why Violin Memory Can Pull Out Of Its Revenue Tailspin,Mar. 9.15,"All-flash arrays manufacturer Violin Memory (NYSE:VMEM) announced its fiscal 2014 fourth quarter and full-year results last week. The results were, quite frankly, horrendous. The company's fourth quarter revenue clocked in at $20.5 million, 27% lower versus the previous year's comparable quarter, and way off the $24 million analysts were expecting. Net loss came in at $46.8 million against $23.5 million during the previous year's comparable quarter. For the full year, Violin Memory reported revenue of $79.0 million, a shocking 27% lower compared to the previous year. The only bright takeaway from the report was that the company's net loss contracted quite bit to $108.9 million from $149.8 million the previous year. As you would expect, VMEM shares tanked badly following the awful report, falling by almost 11% in one day. Violin Memory shares are down 25% year-to-date.This was the first time that Violin Memory posted negative revenue growth over the last five years. Chief executive Kevin DeNuccio attributed this to ''rapid transition to the new Flash Storage Platform (FSP).'' Actually what happened is that customers did not want to buy the company's old 6000-series, and the company had to write off much of that inventory. That is the price that companies in this space have to pay for operating in a rapidly maturing industry that's evolving so fast.Source: The RegisterNew Products With PromiseViolin Memory announced during its earnings call that it its new FSP platform accounted for slightly over 10% of its fourth quarter revenue. I believe that Violin Memory's new FSP has very good potential due to a number of factors. First off, the product is priced as low as $1.50/GB in terms of effective capacity. Effective capacity is calculated as follows:"
Why A Maturing OpenStack Platform Will Lift Red Hat,Jan.21.15,"OpenStack is an open-source IaaS cloud platform that was developed through the collaborative efforts of Rackspace Hosting (NYSE:RAX) and NASA with the objective of countering the dominance of Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS. The platform has AWS-like features including EC2 and S3 compatibility that allows businesses to build their own Amazon-like cloud services in their datacenters.Since its inception, OpenStack has shown robust growth. 451 Research estimates that revenue from the platform will quadruple, growing from $890 million in 2014 to $3.49 billion in 2018. OpenStack is currently the most popular cloud-centric open source project in the market. The open-source platform is supported by tech stalwarts such as Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Mirantis. OpenStack enjoys the backing of more than 200 companies. HP and Red Hat are the two single largest contributors of code to the platform.Top Contributors of Code to OpenStackSource: StackalyticsGrowing ConfidenceOpenStack's growth in its early years was dogged by concerns about whether it was ready for the enterprise. But, the platform has improved considerably over the last two years or so to an extent where more mainstream companies such as eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), BMW (BAMXY) and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) are deploying it. Cisco surprised many observers last year when the company announced it planned to spend $1 billion over the next two years building a giant inter-cloud based on the OpenStack platform. Cisco's giant cloud will allow its partners to shift workloads between clouds without any lock-in."
Comparing America's 3 Largest Electronic Equipment Companies,"Jan. 7, 2015 11:10 AM ET","* All data are as of the close of Tuesday, January 6, 2015. Emphasis is on company fundamentals and financial data rather than commentary.Today we're going to take a bite out of the big apple. No, not New York City. The other big apple … Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL).But to whom shall we compare it in this contest? Apple is a tough company to categorize, since it offers such an array of products and services making it something of a conglomerate. For its computers, we might compare it to Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ). For its phones, we might compare it to Samsung. For its software, we might compare it to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). And there are probably a half dozen other baskets we might toss Apple into.Even market analysts have a hard time figuring out what Apple is and where to put it, with the SPDR group of sector ETFs including it in their Technology Sector ETF (NYSE: XLK), while Yahoo! Finance and other financial data outlets slot it into the Electronic Equipment industry of the Consumer Goods sector. To satisfy both camps, I'll have to go with the general consensus and consider Apple as belonging to the Electronic Equipment industry, while still comparing it to the Technology sector benchmark.To find its closest U.S.-based rivals we have to scroll way down the list of Electronic Equipment companies until we get to 29th-place Harman International Industries Inc (NYSE: HAR), which at a market cap of $6.64 billion is barely 1.07% Apple's size, and 60th-place Universal Electronics Inc. (NASDAQ: UEIC), which at a market cap of $996.89 million is barely 0.16% Apple's size. But then again, Apple is the largest company by market cap in the world, so we'll never really be able to run an ""apples to Apple"" comparison anyway."
Facebook: The Poster Child Of 'Jobless' Companies,Mar.31.15,"Rewind back to Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) April 2012 $1Bn acquisition of Instagram. It seemed to many at the time an astronomical price to pay for an 18-month old startup with just 13 employees. After all, that billion dollar dream team could fit inside an elevator.Citigroup now values Instagram at $35Bn. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg unequivocally proved the doubters wrong with what is now widely considered to have been a brilliant acquisition. After being turned down by Snapchat, Mr. Zuckerberg went on to acquire 55-employee WhatsApp for $19Bn in February, 2014. While the wisdom of that acquisition has yet to be decided, it proves the almost limitless price a company will pay for brand equity and an automated business model.It's a paradox that some of the most successful companies in terms of shareholder value are the smallest in terms of employment. Towering offices, overflowing with employees were forever the hallmark of corporate success. These days, in an era of super lean post-recession enterprises and inside the world of management consulting it's often seen as a failure - a failure to automate and outsource to cut salary expense.One notable exception with regards to the general unwillingness of companies to hire is technology companies, which are in need of high-skill workers. Facebook and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) say they cannot get enough ""top engineers,"" to meet their needs. Mr. Zuckerberg has said Facebook hires as many qualified engineers as it can find. His policy appears in part aimed at keeping talent away from the competition and preparing for future needs. Facebook and Google, relative to their market capitalization, still employ very few workers. They are among the ranks of what we term, ""jobless"" companies, which is the focus of this article."
There's A Lot Of Value In The Information Technology Sector: The S&P 500 2015: Part 3,"Jan. 22, 2015 2:56 PM ET","IntroductionThis series of articles is offered as a sector by sector valuation perspective on the S&P 500 as calendar year 2015 begins. In Part 1 found here I presented a valuation overview of the S&P 500. In Part 2 I reviewed the Energy Sector component of the index. In this, Part 3, I will review the Information Technology Sector, which is the largest industry component of the S&P 500 comprising almost 20% of the entire index.Information Technology: Calling This a Growth Industry is a Gross UnderstatementWhen you stop and think about it, it was not that long ago when technology companies operated in a niche industry. As I was researching this article, I found an interesting report on the history of technology from The Wall Street Journal Classroom Edition that covered the Communications technology industry from circa 1920 to 1995, here is a link to that report.Clearly, the growth in technology from the beginning of this century to 1995 was extraordinary. But, as extraordinary as that growth was, it was nothing compared to what happened in technology from 1990 to 2013. Here's a link to a report from the website Preceden.com that covers this more recent time frame. Remarkably, technological advances continue to expand at what can only be described as at exponential rates."
The Concept Of Cash Return,"May 13, 2015 10:29 AM ET","C.F.I.M.I.T.Y.M. stands for ""Cash Flow is More Important Than Your Mother"" with apologies to my mother who I love dearly, but we are talking investing here and I am trying to make a point.Ultimately as stock holders, we are the owners of the company and the goal of investing in stock is to put cash in our pockets, either by getting dividends or capital gains, now or in the future. If the company can compound retained cash at a rate much greater than I can myself, I don't mind it retaining cash. Otherwise I want management to return it to me either by paying me cash dividends, return of capital or stock buy backs (I know there is a never ending debate of this topic).Cash Flow is harder for a company to manipulate than earnings and better indicator of a company's earning power and financial condition. Increasing free cash is a clear indicator of the financial health of a company.The concept of Cash ReturnThe best yield-based valuation measure I have found is a relatively little-known metric called cash return. In many ways, it's actually a more useful tool than the well known P/E ratio. P/E ratio is based on earnings which is accrual based. You can calculate cash return by adding free cash flow (cash from operations minus capital expenditures) to net interest expense (interest expense minus interest income), and then dividing the sum by enterprise value (market cap plus long-term debt, minus cash). We add back interest expense to free cash flow so that capital structure (i.e. proportion to debt to equity) doesn't impact cash return.Cash Return = (Free Cash Flow + Net Interest Expense) / (Enterprise Value)The goal of the cash return metric is to measure how efficiently the business is using its capital--both equity and debt--to generate free cash flow. In other words, cash return tells you how much free cash flow a company generates as a percentage of how much it would cost an investor to buy out the entire business."
"Repatriation Holiday: Past, Present, And The Companies That Will Benefit In The Future","May 19, 2015 3:27 PM ET","According to a recent Bloomberg survey, American corporations are holding $2.1 trillion of accumulated profits overseas. These profits can be used for expanding global footprint, foreign acquisitions, or off-shore research and development. Companies repatriating profits into the United States face the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. To avoid this tax, financially strong multi-national companies have been taking advantage of low interest rates to leverage their foreign accounts and return excess cash to shareholders. When/if a corporate tax holiday is granted, I expect these companies to bring most of the off-shore profits back home to pay off debt, increase dividends, or repurchase shares. This article will review the recent precedent for repatriation holidays, analyze recent attempts to grant holidays, give a rough prediction of when the next holiday will happen, and list some of the companies that will benefit most. Regardless of your political opinions about corporate taxes, you will profit if positioned correctly when a holiday occurs.The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 Reduced the Repatriation Rate to 5.25%In 2004, the 108th Congress passed the American Jobs Creation Act, effectively reducing the repatriation rate to 5.25%. As a result, American companies brought back $362B from their foreign coffers. Furthermore, this precedent encouraged strong companies to continue holding foreign profits until another holiday is granted.The voting record for the American Jobs Creation Act is very striking.

Sysorex: 3 Reasons To Love (Fear) This Company,Jun. 1.15,"The stock market is always about the tradeoff between risk and reward. The constant battle of fear versus greed. In smaller companies this often plays out with increased upside potential, significant risk to the downside, and greatly increased volatility. Sysorex (SYRX) is one company that embodies all of this; it is truly risk/reward on steroids.Sysorex has multiple business lines that have been compiled together into one entity focusing on key buzzwords such as ""Big Data"" and ""The Internet of Things (IoT)"". When you look at the future of connectivity, data creation and management, and interpretation of massive data fields, it's easy to see how Sysorex has the potential to be a large company in a massively growing industry.And, that's the conundrum with SYRX. Because, for every bit of upside to the company, there is an equal amount of potential downside to this story.Start with Sysorex as a whole. The company is an interesting blend of symbiotic technologies. They offer an increasingly compelling array of products and services centered around data management. Yet, by bringing together small companies, and not generating positive cashflow, investors are teased with promise while suffering ongoing dilution.Check out the chart on SYRX for just the last six months. Gaps upward followed by sell-offs. The upward moves show a company with great promise, downward signifies lack of execution. This is a battle between the two."
Why I'm Upgrading AEterna Zentaris On Valuation,Jan.26.15,"I initiated coverage of Aeterna Zentaris (NASDAQ:AEZS) on October 29th, 2014 with a sell recommendation at $1.17 in front of the Macrilen PDUFA due to significant cash burn, minimal market for Macrilen, and history of non-stop dilution. I reiterated the stock as a sell on November 7th after the ugly Macrilen CRL given the difficulty for small biotechs to guide oncology drugs to approval (the company is currently in the middle of a phase 3 trial for oncology drug zoptarelin doxorubicin) and continued cash burn concerns. Since my initiation at a sell, the stock has declined over 55% and declined almost 24% since my sell reiteration. I wanted to follow up my research from a few months ago to discuss recent news flow and highlight why I believe that current valuation justifies upgrading the stock from a sell to a hold in front of zoptarelin doxorubicin phase 3 results.Collaboration Agreement With Sinopharm A-ThinkOn December 1, 2014, AEterna announced that it had entered into a master collaboration agreement for zoptarelin doxorubicin with Sinopharm A-Think. This exclusive license and technology transfer agreement is for the initial endometrial cancer indication for the China (including Hong Kong and Macau) geographic region. If I were to be sarcastic, I would say: ""Why are they worrying about small collaboration agreements for a drug in phase 3 if they can't even get a drug approved?"" All joking and sarcasm aside though, this deal came with a nice $1 million transfer fee for AEterna. While $1 million is not that much in the scheme of things, it is nonetheless useful for a small-cap development-stage biotech with cash burn concerns. In previous pieces, I have acknowledged that the CEO David Dodd certainly is capable when it comes to the tasks of marketing and commercializing a drug, which this deal supports. While these skills will not be particularly useful if the company is unable to get a drug approved, this deal is no doubt a small incremental positive for the company and illustrates that someone in the market has at least a minimal expectation that the drug will reach the market."
A Sleeping Bull Is Best Left Undisturbed,"Feb. 22, 2015 2:06 AM ET","After setting a new high on the S&P 500 last week, the bull was asleep this holiday shortened trading week, having been virtually flat for the first 3 days of trading and having been devoid of the kind of intra-day volatility that has marked most of 2015.That's of course only if you ignore how the week ended, as this time the S&P 500 wasn't partying alone, as the DJIA and other indexes joined in recording new record highs.For the briefest of moments as the market opened for trading on Friday morning, it looked as if that gently sleeping bull was going to slip into some kind of an unwarranted coma and slip away, as the DJIA dropped 100 points with no consequential news to blame.However, as has been the case for much of 2015, a reversal wiped out that move and returned the market to that gentle sleep that saw a somnolent market add a less than impressive 0.1% to its record close from the previous week.In a perfect example of why you should give up trying to apply rational thought processes to an irrational situation, the market then later awoke from that gentle sleep in a paroxysm of buying activity, as an issue that we didn't seem to care about before today, took hold, thereby demonstrating the corollary to ""It is what it is"" by showing that it only matters when it matters."
"Network-1 Technologies: An Undiscovered, Cash-Rich Company With A Solid Revenue Stream Could See Substantial Upside On Proven IP Assets",Mar. 2.15,"Network-1 Technologies (NYSEMKT:NTIP) is an under-the-radar microcap company whose strong merits have gone unnoticed in the eyes of institutions and mainstream investors. At $2.30 per share, NTIP is a $56M company with no debt, $21.2M in cash and cash equivalents and an ongoing revenue stream from Cisco and twelve other companies. NTIP has the potential to substantially reward shareholders as it asserts its already proven intellectual property rights.A Uniquely Strong Microcap:NTIP is a uniquely financially strong microcap company which positively differentiates it from other microcaps in the space. With over $21M in cash and no debt, the company is funded and has no need to raise cash which is a key risk with many microcap companies. The company also enjoys a $23M net operating loss carryforwards which can shield against future taxes.More interestingly, the company has been repurchasing shares at a fast clip totaling over $7.5M in shares to date. This again is very unique for a microcap company, and demonstrates management's interest to create shareholder value. These generous share repurchases also have the ability of bolstering the share price. Further, a management team whose CEO owns over 25% of the company is directly aligning his interests with his shareholders."
Does Every Dog Have Its Day?,Jan. 5.15,"The Yinzer Analyst is a simple man; he likes his beer cold, his Bills winning and his mutual funds simple, so you can imagine over the years he's found himself increasing disappointed, and not just by the Buffalo Bills. The trend among mutual funds has been to develop increasingly opaque strategies as a way to justify high management fees for subpar performance when compared to index funds or ETF's. From years of researching equity mutual funds I can tell you there are essentially three models; indexed, active managers who are actually indexers, and true active managers; and at the heart of every successful equity mutual fund is a process to find and select individual securities. Some are incredibly complex while others are simply the result of one manager's particular process. One fund that has eschewed complicated strategies and has still managed to deliver superior returns is the SunAmerica Focused Dividend Strategy (MUTF:FDSAX), once the darling of Barron's magazine and that has since fallen on rough times.Now when I say FDSAX has an easy to understand strategy, I mean it's so easy that even someone relatively new to investing should be able to follow the logic behind its construction. Simply put, it's something I like to think of as ""Dogs of the Dow +"" in this case actually the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average plus 20 stocks from the Russell 1000 (which may also include the Dogs of the Dows). The stocks chosen from the Russell 1000 are selected based on a screening process that looks at valuation, profitability and earnings growth. The portfolio is put together annually and with the positions more-or-less equally weighted with no concern towards sector weightings and held for an entire year. That's all there is to it. Now I choose to call it the ""Dogs of the Dow +"" given that I think it's fairly reasonable to assume that the 10 highest yielding stocks are likely to be the ten worst performers over the previous year and while the specific metrics used to pick the stocks for the Russell 1000 aren't publicly disclosed, my assumption is that the system used by SunAmerica would be recognizable to stalwarts of the investment profession like Benjamin Graham."
"NCR Corp.: Major Accounting Issues, Excessive Leverage And Limited Strategic Alternatives Point To 45-70% Downside",Apr.23.15,"Spruce Point is pleased to release an investment research opinion on NCR Corp. (NYSE:NCR) with a ""Strong Sell"" opinion.Please visit our website for the full report at www.sprucepointcap.com and follow us on Twitter. Please also review our investment disclaimers at the bottom of the report.NCR is our favorite short idea, a company that everyone knows, but that we believe no one understands. In Spruce Point's opinion, there are numerous reasons to be extremely cautious of investing in NCR. We are short the stock for the following reasons:I. Executive SummaryNCR is facing secular headwinds; its levered hardware to software transformation is likely to fail, and it lacks viable strategic alternativesNCR is selling investors on its ability to transform from a hardware to software provider, while market fundamentals move rapidly against it; alternative and digital payment platforms such as Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google Wall (NASDAQ:GOOG), Square, Venmo, and soon, Samsung Wallet (OTC:SSNLF) are eroding demand for its core ATM hardware, while its ""banking transformation"" opportunity is a melting ice cube as retail banks close underperforming locations. There are plenty of recent examples of failed hardware/software transformations (e.g. IBM and HP).The company has made expensive acquisitions to transform itself, paying an average EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA of 4x and 23x, respectively, for Retalix, Radiant, and Digital Insight. In January 2014, NCR acquired Digital Insight for $1.6 billion (5x sales and 16x EBITDA), and paid a $600m premium to what Thoma Bravo paid to acquire it from Intuit just 5 months earlier! It now appears that Digital Insight's revenue growth and margin expansion have stalled, while leaving NCR with adjusted leverage of approx 5.1x Debt/EBITDA, according to Moody's.We will present evidence to suggest the company has botched its other acquisitions, has almost no organic growth, and limited visibility in its business as it spins a meaningless backlog discussion.Its close German competitor, Wincor-Nixdorf (OTCPK:WNXDF), recently pre-warned that it would not meet its 2015 financial guidance, and is also exploring strategic alternatives - its stock swiftly fell by ~18%. Wincor has almost no debt, while NCR is levered to the brink.NCR is handicapped by its mountain of debt, and has most of its cash trapped abroad in foreign jurisdictions subject to taxation; it lacks the resources to acquire anything further, and its covenants may restrict its ability to do things like pay a dividend or repurchase stock. NCR is already viewed as a junk credit by S&P and Moody's (BB+ stable /Ba3 negative). A foolish move to institute a dividend/buyback would risk a credit rating downgrade by the agencies and further increase its cost of capital and likelihood of default.Lastly, we believe that since NCR drastically overpaid for all of its acquisitions, it is unlikely to receive anything near what it has paid to acquire Retalix, Radiant or Digital Insight."
Why The Hot SSD Market Will Favor SanDisk More Than Micron,Jan.23.15,"Advanced semiconductor solution providers SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) and Micron (NASDAQ: MU) are large NAND chip players that have been hurt by falling NAND prices. NAND chips are used in storage drives, cameras, smartphones and tablets. The two, however, also share a bright spot - they are some of the largest players in the red-hot SSD market. The question that begs answering is which of the two companies stand to benefit the most from the rapidly-growing SSD market, both in the near-term and short-term?Shares of both companies are some of the most volatile in the tech industry. This can partly be attributed to the unusually high level of institutional ownership of both companies' shares - 100% for SanDisk and 95% for Micron. SanDisk shares had a rollercoaster ride in 2014, at one point selling off by as much as 20% in mid-July before making a strong comeback and finishing the year up by around 45%. Meanwhile, Micron has a similar rollercoaster ride, but managed to finish the year around 60% up. Over the long-term, Micron shares have tended to underperform those of SanDisk, though not by much - the shares have tucked on gains of 238% over the last five years compared to 264% for SanDisk. Over the long-term, both have been good investments without much to pick between them.Year-to-date, SanDisk shares have sold off by a large margin of 19.3% while Micron shares are down 11.1%.SSD Market SharesFor revenue from SSD products to be able to offset weaknesses in both companies' core products such as NAND and DRAM, it will have to comprise a significant proportion of either company's overall revenue. NAND flash revenue clocked in at 27% for Micron and 24% for SanDisk (embedded products that use NAND flash) in 2014. The two companies therefore have significant exposure to the cyclical business. The current weakness of the NAND market is not expected to ease anytime soon. Samsung (OTC: OTC:SSNLF) commercialized 3D NAND in 2014. 3D NAND as well as TLC (Triple-Level Cell) NAND are both expected to gradually become more mainstream and slowly push MLC (Multi-Level Cell) NAND to the sidelines. Traditionally, TLC has mainly been used in flash memory cards, USB drives, client SSDs and low-cost smartphones. TLC is, however, beginning to be used in high-end smartphones such as iPhone 6 as well as enterprise data center SSDs. Even though SanDisk and Samsung sell TLC, the product is priced at just 80% of MLC, meaning the transition to TLC is likely to take a hit on both."
3D Systems: Bankruptcy And Goodwill Impairments Aren't The Real Threats,Feb.22.15,"For whatever reason, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is attracting a lot of attention regarding a likely writedown of goodwill and the potential of bankruptcy. One issue isn't meaningful to the valuation of the stock and the other is very improbable considering the current financial situation. The important issues are new competitive threats and margin compression that are reducing the valuation multiples of the sector to more normal levels.3D Systems spent the last year collapsing from the irrational highs reached in the past. With the stock trading at $31 and now worth only $3.5 billion, the following reasons are why investors need to ignore goodwill and bankruptcy fears and focus on competition.Goodwill ImpairmentIlluminati Investments highlighted that 3D Systems was in line to take an impairment charge against the large goodwill balance on the balance sheet. The issue popped up due to the Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS)$100 million writedown from the MakerBot acquisition. The suggestion is that any writedown would have a detrimental impact on 3D Systems valuation.Investors need to understand the goodwill concept and the reason it exists on the balance sheet in the first place. Even more importantly, why it never matters to investors. According to Investopedia, the definition of goodwill is the following:An intangible asset that arises as a result of the acquisition of one company by another for a premium value. The value of a company's brand name, solid customer base, good customer relations, good employee relations and any patents or proprietary technology represent goodwill. Goodwill is considered an intangible asset because it is not a physical asset like buildings or equipment. The goodwill account can be found in the assets portion of a company's balance sheet."
TransAct Technologies: Casinos And Restaurants Are The Chance For Forgotten Shares,Feb.17.15,"TransAct Technologies (NASDAQ:TACT) business is developing printers under brands: Epic, Ithaca and Printrex. TACT customers are: banks, retail companies, government, oil & gas companies. TransAct Technologies was founded in 1996. Company HQ: Hamden, CT.RecommendationI recommend to accumulate TransAct Technologies Incorporated based on:· good time from the point of view of technical analysis,· the company has no debt,· the company seems to be forgotten,· TACT implements cost-cutting plan,· the company constantly maintains or even expands dividend yield, and· there are good forecasts for casinos and restaurants - these are two of the three sectors in which the company wants to grow in coming years.JustificationTACT is down ca. 56% from its November 2013 historical peak. This decline was driven by an EPS miss in May 2014. Stock is undervalued in comparison with main peers. TransAct Technologies declared several cost-cutting initiatives, which should give 2 ml USD annual savings in 2015. TACT is focusing on restaurants and casinos (higher margins).What is most interesting, TACT seems to be forgotten. The last important transaction from the famous fund manager took place in June 2012 (sell), and the last insider transaction was in December 2013 (sell) - says GuruFocus.com data.FundamentalsThe company's results in Q3'2014 were not good. Net sales went down from $16.8 ml in Q3'2013 to $13.4 ml, similarly EBITDA (from $2.3 ml to $0.4 ml) and diluted earnings per share (from $0.17 to $0.01). But TACT right now diversifies revenue base in seeking higher gross margin businesses. The company focuses especially on food safety terminals (Ithaca) for restaurants, color printers (Printrex) for the oil & gas seismic and exploration industry and thermal printers (Epic) that are placed in casino slot machines."
AMD: Mullins Is Great For Game-Centric Tablets,Mar.25.15,"I can understand why Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) continues to ignore the fast-growing Chromebook industry. Mark Papermaster, Chief Technology officer of AMD, explained that Chromebooks are not high-margin products. Papermaster also believes Chrome OS computers are now fit for AMD's graphics-driven APU products. AMD will not stoop down to selling $7 processors for $200 Chromebooks.AMD's allergy to low-margin processors made Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) the big winner of the rapid increase in sales of Chromebooks last year. Intel also sold more than 46 million tablet application processors in 2014. Intel is using contra revenue to push itself to becoming the no.2 tablet processor supplier, just behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).Unfortunately, AMD does not have the money to match Intel's contra revenue-driven tablet strategy. However, I insist that AMD's new CEO should heed the example set by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Since Xiaomi is the only major tablet vendor to use Tegra K1, Nvidia simply released the $299 Nvidia Shield gaming tablet last year.Tablet Gaming Is Besting Console GamingAMD's future, in my opinion, would be better if the company starts adjusting its tactics. Yes, there is no money in selling Radeon-powered Chromebooks but there is good money to be made in selling gaming tablets. Lisa Su cannot rely on console sales to keep AMD afloat for very long. The Radeon assets should expand its total addressable market to include tablets and smartphones.Look at the chart below, Newzoo says tablet gaming is the fastest growing segment at 37% year-over-year growth in 2014. There are now 527 million gamers who use tablets, and 1.27 billion people who use their phones."
AWS Spinoff Could Drive Amazon's Resurrection,Jan.21.15,"Each tech investor or gadget enthusiast has his opinion about the beaten-down Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the reasons that brought the eCommerce giant to that place. Some argue about overvaluation of Amazon's online retail business. Some argue about wrong business decisions. Some argue about the competence of management. In Amazon's case, almost every argument is right and together they all brought Amazon to its current struggling situation. In my eyes, Amazon is still an innovative company that puts its focus on the wrong products and business ideas. Amazon must regain its focus before it can rise again.Amazon can achieve this focus with a AWS (Amazon Web Services) spinoff that will signal to shareholders that the company is getting back on track. Such a spinoff will also attract new shareholders to benefit from the value this move will add to their investment.Amazon currently operates three different businesses:Core online retail business: Includes the core eCommerce business and its adjacencies, such as Amazon Fresh (grocery ordering service), Amazon Prime, Amazon Supply, Amazon Local Register (competing with Square and PayPal here), etc.Hardware business includes the classic Kindle product line, Kindle Fire and Fire Phone.AWS includes all Amazon's cloud computing services such as EC2, S3, ""EMR"", etc.The core online retail business is Amazon's bread and butter. Amazon generates revenues in this business from selling goods online in the traditional retail model as well as from selling ads on these platforms. Amazon has a few emerging revenue streams in its core business targeted to support and expand its core offering, such as Amazon Local Register and the media business. The hardware business is Amazon's declining non-core business while AWS is Amazon's growing non-core business."
Hortonworks: A Speculative Move To Benefit From Competition In The Hadoop Market,Feb.18.15,"Hadoop solutions developer Hortonworks (NASDAQ:HDP) is expected to report its Q4'14 earnings results for the first time as a public company next week. Hortonworks is one of the three Hadoop market leaders, together with Cloudera and MapR, and is the first to go public. Since Hortonworks's IPO took place in the middle of December when the market went south, the company decided to underprice its IPO share price compared to its last funding round. The goal of the underpricing was to attract more investors to the IPO and maximize the amount of funds raised. As shown in Chart 1 below, the underpricing tactics were successful, and the company's stock soared 65% on the first day of trading, similar to the industry average.Hortonworks had a better IPO than New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) and Workiva (NYSE:WK) which went public on the same day and yielded 48% and -2%, respectively. However, while Workiva and New Relic present sustainable business models, a large customer base, and impressive top line growth, Hortonworks is a different story. The company is dependent on three primary customers which also are investors/partners and account for more than 37% of its revenues. In an earlier article, I claimed that this dependency - together with the small number of overall customers and the rapidly growing net loss - makes Hortonworks a little pre-mature for the market in my eyes. However, as Hadoop is gaining traction and two additional IPOs are just around the corner, it may be the time to initiate a speculative move on Hortonworks, which I will explain in more detail."
Is Hewlett-Packard Stock Worth Considering Right Now?,Jun.19.15,"Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) stock is trading near its 52-week low, and its last price $32.21 is down 21.6% from its 52-week high of $41.1 from January 09. Although the company has not done very well in the last few quarters, in my opinion, it is a ""strong buy"" at this level. That due to the opportunities that will be created from the upcoming separation of its business and its tremendous valuation.In my opinion, the planned split into two companies - 1) PC and Printers, and 2) Enterprise businesses - will benefit the company and its shareholders. The spin-off is expected to complete by November 01. I believe that separate managements focusing on their particular business will enhance opportunities for both companies.According to Bloomberg, CEO Meg Whitman said that stock held by Hewlett-Packard shareholders will be converted into shares of both companies using a yet-to-be-disclosed ratio at the time of the separation. Initially, the company anticipates that the sum of the dividends paid by both stocks will equal the current dividend, with a higher proportion coming from HP Inc.The main risk for HPQ stock now is related to the proposed split. Competitors might describe HPQ after the separation as a company in transition, and will try gain market share in every niche business in which HP competes. In any case, in my view, there are more winning opportunities than risks for the split."
Why I'm Buying Lenovo And Selling Hewlett-Packard,Jun. 3.15,"One mistake investors make when seeking value is avoiding the stocks that keep going up. The reasoning is that since the stock moved higher, it ""costs"" more to start a position. Conversely, a stock that falls sharply may look like it has value. It is possible that there is a bigger discount to intrinsic value after a stock sells off. The condition is that intrinsic value exceeds the current share price. Selling (or shorting) Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) ahead of its split on November 1, 2015 and buying Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) is counterintuitive: HP dropped 17.5 percent from its yearly high, while Lenovo nearly quadrupled steadily over the last four years. Does this strategy make any sense at all?Hewlett-Packard is splitting its PC and printer business from its corporate hardware business. HP said the ""HP Enterprise"" unit will focus on ""cloud, big data, security and mobility in the New Style of IT. Customers will still get financial support via HP Financial Services.HP Inc. will ""enable investments in growth markets such as 3-D printing and new computing experiences.""Operational distractions from splitAs the sector innovates and moves forward, HP's management will be distracted splitting the firm over the next five months. Its time will be spent hiring new leaders, boosting FTE, and restructuring operations in an effort to cut costs. Cost savings and profitability will show up through one-time write-downs.HP Enterprise will fall behindIn reality, HP is not innovating on any new technology or making strategic acquisitions that will help the firm catch up to the competition. IBM (NYSE:IBM), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are already big players in the cloud. IBM's cloud computing services made $7.7 billion over the last year. Amazon's AWS made $1.57 billion in the last quarter alone (which gives an annual run rate of around $6.3 billion)."
Why I Converted All My Shares To HPE,Dec. 4.15,"Last month I wrote an article on Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) & HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) with the title ""Two Cheap Stocks But Both With Worries"" I wrote this article as I was a shareholder of HPQ and was trying to figure out what to do. In my conclusion I wrote:HPE is expected to generate more free cash flow, more stable growth, better margins, the EPS relies less on productivity gains, and is cheaper. On the negative side, HPE has shut down its Helion cloud service (see here), and sold its TippingPoint security hardware (see here).....HPQ, which is also cheap, will return more cash to investors (up to 75%), and it has the potential 3D printer market. However, its products are in decline, and EPS has a higher chance of missing due to any miscalculation of FX and productivity gains....There are worries for both stocks, hence without more information, I can only conclude that I continue to hold onto both. If I had to choose, I would lean more towards on HPE.I believe there is now enough information from earnings and the conference call to make a decision, and that decision was to sell all my HPQ and switch into HPE.Hewlett Packard EnterpriseManagement stated their 5 priorities for 2016 which were:Grow top-line sales in constant currencyProduce a yoy increase in operating profitGrow free cash flowExecute their innovation roadmapStabilize revenue and expand margin in Enterprise ServicesThis last quarter was the second consecutive one with sales growth in constant currency. This constant currency growth is expected to continue in FY16. HPE also announced a new partnership with Microsoft where they will build and sell industry-specific business apps for Windows 10 and Azure will become a preferred public cloud partner."
3 Things To Consider With Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Ahead Of Earnings,Nov.12.15,"When Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) report quarterly results on November 24, investors holding these stocks will wonder what to do next. The report should contain no surprises or good news, only updates on cost cuts and promises of future growth. Investors will have to differentiate the promises from the achievable deliverables.There are three things investors should consider ahead of the company's quarterly report.1) Enterprise ServicesHewlett-Packard Enterprise, which I will refer to as HPE, reported its revenue stabilized in the third quarter. The company benefited from growth in the security and IT management Saas segments. The company set a goal of sustaining an operating margin target of between 7 - 9 percent. This operating margin target applies to the fiscal year 2016 - 2018. This is highly achievable, but profitability growth will be driven first by massive job cuts. HP already said in September that it would cut 33,300 jobs, on top of the 55,000 reduction announced. 30,000 will come from HPE, while 3,300 HP Inc. workers will lose their jobs.HPE has a strong customer base, which includes Deutsche Bank, U.S. Department of the Navy, Volkswagen, and Kraft.HPE stabilized its operating margins in its last quarter. Expect HP's revenue in the fourth quarter to fall between 10 and 16 percent:Source: HPOther firms like EMC (NYSE:EMC) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) reported disappointing results. IBM reported revenue of $19.28B on October 19, a whopping 13.9 percent drop from last year. It also lowered its earnings guidance for 2015. Similarly, HPE will probably announce more write-downs and increase its cost cutting measures in light of the weaker enterprise environment."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise: Aruba Driving Blue Dot Indoor Location Into The Big Leagues,Dec. 2.15,"Aruba, a subsidiary of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), just announced a major update to their Meridian solution for indoor location services. Meridian has delivered enterprise-scale indoor location solutions for many years. Aruba acquired Meridian in 2013 and HP Enterprise acquired Aruba in 2015.The number of indoor location solutions on the market have skyrocketed, with over a hundred companies delivering a wide variety of technologies and solutions to the market. Numerous trials of indoor location technologies have been launched in the past year, in shopping malls, hospitals, airports, stadiums and more. But these solutions have yet to truly spread into mainstream common use.Furthermore, many companies in the area have shifted from offering full indoor location solutions to offering proximity marketing solutions. Proximity marketing systems, usually based on Bluetooth beacons, do not compute people's locations as GPS does, with a ""blue dot"" moving around a map. Rather, they detect only when a person is near a beacon, indicating that they are in a place of interest. These systems then send promotions, information or other content to people in each beacon's vicinity."
"Meg Whitman As Shiva, The Destroyer",Sep.16.15,"One of the great mysteries of the Silicon Valley is why Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) CEO Meg Whitman continues to get a hearing on Wall Street as some sort of corporate builder.She's Shiva - the destroyer.Since taking over as CEO in September 2011, Whitman has dismantled what was once a great American company. The cuts began in 2012, and by last month had amounted to 55,000 people out of a workforce that once totaled 317,000.What is the headline today, about what Whitman can do when her HP Enterprise splits from the old printer and PC business? She plans to layoff another 25,000 people, maybe 30,000. Almost a third of the people who welcomed her as CEO will have hit the bricks by this time next year.Whitman became HP CEO in the wake of the disastrous acquisition of Autonomy for $11 billion. But she was a member of the board that approved that acquisition. Since becoming CEO, she has acquired six more companies, including Eucalyptus, which was supposed to power HP's move into the cloud. That was, in fact, an expensive acquihire of open source legend Marten Mickos, who was put in charge of HP's cloud efforts. Well, within five months Mickos was out, and within seven, the company was saying public cloud ""makes no sense for us."" Leadership!Whitman's supporters will note that the company's shares have advanced 14% under her tenure. The fact is had you sold your HP shares on her appointment and put that money into an index fund tracking the Dow Jones Industrial Average, you would be up 48%.All Whitman has been doing, since becoming CEO, has been whacking away at her once-great company, throwing other people aside as ballast to keep the balloon afloat, and collecting enormous piles of money, mostly stock awards, totaling $19.4 billion last year and $17.4 million the year before. She even received a $4.3 million bonus last year and, in Wall Street terms, she earned it, as her ""strategy"" of buying Mickos and claiming cloud leadership boosted the shares by 38% over the course of that year."

Genworth: 10 Reasons Why This $5 Turnaround Stock Is A Strong Buy,Aug.20.15,"Once in a rare while, the market offers up a true bargain that is in plain sight. However, too much negativity and the herd mentality coupled with too much focus on the short-term keeps many investors away from buying a bargain. For example, remember when investors were extremely negative and too spooked to buy Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) when it was a $5 stock? Or how about when Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) shares traded for about $12 just a couple years ago on the belief that there was not much of a future for this company. With both of these examples, many investors did not want to get involved by investing in ""dogs"" that obviously were facing challenges in business, but that is exactly why it was a great time to buy Bank of America and Hewlett Packard. If you want to buy a stock when the business model looks perfect and when many investors love the stock you are almost sure to be investing at the wrong time or paying too much for the stock. Recently, I found what I believe is a rare opportunity to buy shares of a profitable business at a bargain valuation.Genworth (NYSE:GNW) shares have recently been hammered and now trade for just about $5. Let's go through some of the negatives that the skeptics will want to talk about, which include: concerns about management credibility, the recent charges and challenges facing the long term care business, the fact that this stock has performed terribly and is trading at about one-third of the 52-week high, etc. I get all of this and would fully agree if these concerns were not already very well-known as well as priced into the stock. All of this is yesterday's news and the stock is not trading at rich levels or even fair levels at this point. In fact, the valuation has become absurdly cheap, especially relative to the rest of the market as well as when compared to the insurance industry. This is not the first time I have become interested in buying Genworth after a big plunge to around the $5 level. In July, 2012, when Genworth was trading at $4.83 per share, I wrote an article titled ""3 Reasons To Buy Genworth For A Possible Double"". Subsequently, shares of Genworth actually doubled and even more than tripled in value. Let's take a look at my top ten reasons for buying Genworth shares now:"
Two Cheap Stocks But Both With Worries,Nov. 5.15,"As is well known, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) split into two companies: the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise with a new ticker symbol HPE that will focus on enterprise (i.e. servers, storage, networking and related services) while the old printer and PC business will be renamed HP, Inc. and remain under the current ticker HPQ. This article will look at these two businesses and their valuations based on what we know and guidance.The Old BusinessHP, Inc. is a global market leader in both printing and PCs with $55 billion in revenue, 230,000 channel partners, over 18,000 patents, and revenue from all over the world.(Source: HPQ Investor Relations)Despite the size of HP, Inc., the markets and opportunities do exist for growth (see below). The most promising being 3D printing. Note that while printing is 40% of sales, it generates 78% of operating profit due to an 18% margin vs. 3% for PCs (see above and below).(Source: HPQ Investor Relations)While opinions vary, the growth of the 3D printer market is expected to be 20%+. If HPQ succeeds in this area which as noted is higher margin, then shareholders could benefit greatly."
Avago Technologies: Growing By Acquisition,Jun.23.15,"Most companies are founded with one or two employees. If they offer a good product or service at a competitive price, they expand and grow their client numbers. As a result of more clients, businesses invest more money in hiring, training and developing new employees, and small businesses become medium-sized enterprises of 50 - 500 people.If the product or service has wide reach and customers, a small minority of firms have the option of growing beyond this medium size to become large corporations. But once businesses become large corporations, their ability to grow naturally by selling more of the same product or service becomes limited. This natural growth is known as ""organic growth."" Where organic growth stalls, shareholders and options trading companies look to management to provide new avenues of growth. One of the major ways companies can accomplish this is through acquiring other companies and adding their products and services to their own.Avago Technologies (NASDAQ:AVGO) has recently taken exactly this approach. Early indications are that the market likes the move, which has seen the stock price rise from below $70 late last year to recent highs above $140. So can Avago's share price continue its upward march?Understanding the BusinessAvago Technologies is in the business of supplying the world with op-to-electrics components to integrate into electronic devices. These components also are often known as semiconductors and have the ability to transport information, light and data within devices and from one device to another. It helps to think of AVGO as the company that provides the raw material that helps built the ""roads"" that digital information travels on.Avago began life as a spin off from its parent company, Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ), at the height of the dot com boom in 1999. The company's largest transformative acquisition to date was the $6 billion plus purchase of LSI Corporation, which helped broaden the appeal of the company to other businesses that needed mass market solutions for their own devices."
The WinTel Alliance Dominates Again In Laptops,Oct. 9.15,"I like it very much that Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) stock price is now above $32. Good propaganda on Seeking Alpha often does influence the outlook of many investors. I'm therefore publishing more good news for INTC believers. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), which previously signed-up to market Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Surface Pro to its enterprise clients, unveiled its own Windows 10 version of the Surface Pro.Like Dell, Hewlett-Packard is not going to play as a mere subordinate/minion to Microsoft's ambitious plan to saturate the enterprise market with Surface computers. The Spectre x2 is Hewlett-Packard's latest tablet/laptop for its enterprise clients.It has a 12-inch Full HD resolution (1920x1280) screen with a detachable keyboard like the Surface Pro.(Source: Hewlett-Packard)I like it also that HP will go all-Skylake for its latest Windows 10 laptops. The Spectre 2's CPU is better than the Core M variety that is found inside the 2015 MacBook. Aside from giving Intel the processor supply deal, HP's latest laptop also comes equipped with a RealSense Camera and premium Bang & Olufsen audio.The basic model of the HP Spectre 2 will retail for $800. Budget-constrained corporations who are intimidated with the $1,499 basic price tag of the Surface Book would therefore likely consider HP's much cheaper Spectre 2 or the Surface Pro 4.It doesn't really matter if HP will promote Spectre 2 over Surface Pro when it makes sales presentations to corporate buyers. Intel will still benefit from HP's use of the RealSense Camera and Skylake Core m-series processors. Just like Dell, Hewlett-Packard is one of the world's top vendors of laptop/notebook computers."
The Good Business Portfolio: All 24 Positions,"Jul. 13, 2015 8:20 AM ET","This article gives my 10 guidelines for company investment selection for the complete Good Business Portfolio. The intent in these guidelines is to create a portfolio that is a large cap balanced portfolio between the different styles of investing. Income investors take too much risk to get their high yields. Bottom fishing investors get catfish. Value investors have to have a foresight to see the future. You see from the guidelines below that I want a portfolio that is defensive, provides income and does not take high risks. I limit the portfolio to 25 companies; more than this is almost impossible to keep track of. At present I have 24 companies and have open slots awaiting General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) spin-offs.Guidelines (Company selection)1. NEVER buy any company or security that has more than three letters in the symbol. I know this eliminates just about all mutual funds, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and a lot of other large cap good companies, but it also eliminates the small cap startups and many others that are not good investments for a retirement portfolio. The only exception to this guideline is the purchase of a high grade corporate investment grade bond fund.2. Capitalization should be at least $7 Billion (share price times number of shares outstanding)3. Company should have a dividend of at least 1.0% on a yearly basis and the dividend should have been increased in 7 of the last 10 years."
Is Barracuda A Worthy Short?,Jun.15.15,"Barracuda Networks (NYSE:CUDA) is one of the most shorted stocks on the planet. With over 10% of the float shorted, there is a high degree of pessimism surrounding the company. On multiple occasions over the past year, the company has had more than 10% of the shares sold short (Source: Yahoo! Finance).Based on current volumes, it would take almost four days for stocks short positions to be unwound. This would appear to set the company up for a massive potential short squeeze.The question remains however, does the company deserve to be so heavily shorted?Barracuda's Target Market is Inherently Less AttractiveUnlike larger peers, Barracuda has carved out a niche of servicing small-to-mid-sized businesses. These smaller customers have different needs than larger corporations that work towards Barracuda's favor in terms of limiting competition.This target market does have one major weakness however. Chiefly, one of their customers' biggest security concerns is budgetary, putting pressure on pricing power. According to an IDC survey, mid-market customers list budget concerns as a greater challenge than even the increasing sophistication of computer and network attacks. For Barracuda, this means that their customers are more concerned with saving money than with preventing themselves from attacks."
Google/Alphabet Move For Greene Demonstrates Weakness,Nov.20.15,"Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) became just the latest company to acknowledge its weakness in the face of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services juggernaut, doing an acqui-hire of Bebop Technologies in order to get its founder Diane Greene, who previously helped found VMware (NYSE:VMW).Greene will now be placed in charge of all of Google's business-oriented public cloud efforts, as well as its efforts in business application software, where it has lately been falling behind Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and even IBM (NYSE:IBM) as well as Amazon. But the scale of Greene's problem goes beyond this. SRG Research reports that Amazon is currently bigger in the cloud than the next four names combined, adding Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) to a list of also-rans that also includes Google, Microsoft and IBM.Other companies have tried in the past, and failed, to slow Amazon's moves in public cloud. Hewlett Packard, now Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), famously acqui-hired open source celebrity Marten Mickos to run its cloud operation, then let him go and closed up shop less than a year later. VMware itself is being used as currency in Dell's acquisition of EMC (EMC). Rackspace (NYSE:RAX) has managed a profit but at the expense of growth - in terms of market share it's not a factor. Large phone companies like AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) advertise their own cloud efforts extensively, but don't register in terms of market share."
Oracle Thumbs Nose At Shareholders On CEO Pay... Again,Sep.29.15,"After years of losing its ""Say on Pay"" vote, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) backed down on executive pay a little in 2014, when Larry Ellison stepped down as CEO but in 2015, pay is right back up there.Co-CEOs Mark Hurd and Safra Catz both received pay rises of 41% in 2015, according to Oracle's latest proxy statement, filed on Friday, after seeing their pay fall in their first year as CEO.Oracle has never won a Say on Pay vote, the shareholder advisory vote on executive pay, even though former CEO, current chairman and CTO Ellison owns around a quarter of the company and is unlikely to vote against his own pay package. With these raises, what's commonly called a ""Nay on Pay"" looks set to repeat itself for the fourth time.In an earlier article for Fortune I wrote that, reversing years of ignoring shareholder dissatisfaction with pay, Oracle announced in 2014 that it would reduce stock option grants to Ellison and to Hurd and Catz, seemingly in response to the negative Say on Pay votes. But while that did lead to a pay decrease for Ellison, this was just a miniscule 5% cut because while his options went down he received a $30 million performance stock award that almost made up for it. His pay went from $67 million to $64 million. Performance stock awards for Hurd and Catz more than made up for any reduction in stock options boosting their pay from $37 million each in 2014 to $53 million this year.While it's an improvement in pay practices to switch from stock options to performance stock awards - because in order to earn the awards, certain performance targets must be met - shareholders are unlikely to be impressed by these moves, especially as the risk of forfeiting the awards has been mitigated by increasing their value significantly. The new performance stock awards are based on revenue growth and net cash growth against a basket of peers that is made up of: Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Workday (NYSE:WDAY)."
Disruptive Companies To Watch Out For,"Jun. 3, 2015 2:15 PM ET","The biggest impacts on the world by corporations don't come by being the same - it's what stands out that makes a difference. Disruptive innovation is a powerful force that almost everyone strives for but few succeed at. When the opportunity arises, companies face a dilemma - keep growing in the current market and strive to make a product or service better or embrace a new way of doing things that will open up an entirely new and undiscovered market.This is the key motivator behind disruptive innovation. It's the creation of a new marketplace and the opportunity to reach new types of customers that drives growth. These changes can be as simple as developing a new operational framework such as when Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) moved away from its mail rental business to an online streaming video service or world-changing such as when IBM (NYSE:IBM) launched the first personal computer.Right now, we're in a golden age of innovation. Technology is rapidly changing and the entire industry is on an uptrend. It's evidenced by the fact that the NASDAQ has climbed over 7% year-to-date compared to the relatively mild 2.5% performance of the S&P 500. M&A activity is strong as well - recently the semiconductor maker Avago (NASDAQ:AVGO) Technologies announced that it was in talks to acquire rival company Broadcom (BRCM), which helped lift all tech stocks on the news.There are several promising new technologies that investors should be keeping a close watch of. Companies making a name for themselves in these niches could be the next breakout company for the next decade like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been for the past decade."
4 Ways To Profit From The Spin-Off Advantage,"Oct. 21, 2015 9:33 AM ET","More and more companies seem to be recognizing the benefits of spinning-off assets or stand-alone business segments these days. In 2014, there were 60 completed U.S. spin-offs, third most of all time behind only 1999 and 2000. Spin-Off Advisors is predicting another 51 completed spin-offs by the end of 2015 as well.Why spin-off?Spin-offs are typically viewed as positive for the parent company. The move is often made in an attempt to unlock some type of value in the parent company's core business. For example, a company with a large, well-established, high margin, highly profitable business may also have a smaller segment that requires large debt load and/or operates on extremely low margins, but is a very high growth business. These two types of businesses typically appeal to different investors, and running both of them under the same corporate roof could mean that both the full fundamental value of the core business and the full growth value of the smaller business are not fully realized in the combined company's share price.By spinning-off the smaller company, the parent company immediately removes debt from its balance sheet, improves its overall margins and appeals more to value investors. The stand-alone growth business is free to shine on its own for growth investors as well.Boosting margins, stimulating growth, adjusting debt, improving borrowing prospects and increasing market valuation are all common reasons why companies choose to spin-off businesses."
"ServiceNow: Engaged In An Unprofitable, Growth At Any Price Strategy",Jun.22.15,"In November 2014, I initially tagged ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) as prospective short play, arguing that its rampant use of stock-based compensation (SBC) led it to completely abandon any fiscal responsibility. I then followed up my initial article with a second one highlighting the ongoing stock dilution and risks related to potentially serious legal challenges from HP and BMC. Since the time of the original article, the stock has risen 20%.I'd now like to revisit the original idea, to see whether other valuation arguments might sustain today's valuation (which, as a reminder, is summarized below).Current Expenditures vs. Future ProfitabilityWe know from the company's 10-K and 10-Q that it has no expectations of being profitable in the near future. Here's the most recent language to that effect:From the three months ended March 31, 2009 to the three months ended March 31, 2015, our revenues grew from $5.2 million to $212.0 million. We expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to decline into the foreseeable future. We also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our capacity to support anticipated growth. These investments may not result in increased revenues or growth in our business. Even if our revenue continues to increase, we expect to continue to incur a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) loss during future periods due to increased costs such as non-cash charges associated with equity awards and business combinations and other expenses."
Is Super Micro Computer Still Undervalued?,Jun. 3.15,"Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been in the spotlight recently. A fund manager recently commented on the stock and the fact that moved it by 6%. An SA contributor, Ryan Wood, also published a bullish take on the stock. As there is plenty of qualitative research available on the stock, let's analyze SMCI from a valuation perspective to see whether recent bullish takes are justified.About the company, Super Micro Computer is a technology company that designs high-performance, high-efficiency server solutions and markets them to data centers, cloud operators, enterprises, scalable server farms, and Big Data and HPC labs. SMCI generated $1.47 billion in revenue during 2014, and achieved a 1.3 million server-unit/year run rate during 2014. Products of the company include servers and server subsystems, including chassis, power supplies and server boards. More than 800 customers purchased from SMCI during 2014, with no single customer accounting for more than 10% of its revenue. Regarding revenue classification, the company generated 50.5% of its revenue from optimized servers and 49.5% from subsystems and accessories during the fiscal year ended 2014.SMCI claims that its high-end motherboards and servers outperform the competitors, and it is a leader in power saving. It looks like the company is targeting server markets with the theme of power efficiency, and as a result, a lower TCO for the customers. SMCI's performance in recent years complements its claim. The company posted revenue growth of 14% and 26.2% during 2013 and 2014, respectively, outperforming its large competitors like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM)."
Micron's Many (Indirect) Relationships With Tsinghua,Nov. 4.15,"In July 2015, rumors of Tsinghua Unigroup making a $23 billion bid for Micron (NASDAQ:MU) surfaced. Before this bid, many Micron shareholders (and Americans in general) probably have never heard of Tsinghua Unigroup. In 2014, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) purchased a 20% stake in a holding company that owns Spreadtrum and RDA Microelectronics under Tsinghua Unigroup, an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings. Tsinghua Holdings is a limited liability corporation funded by Tsinghua University, an elite research university located in Beijing. To those who are not familiar with universities in Asia, an accurate description of the prestige of Tsinghua in China is similar to that of MIT or CalTech in the U.S. Tsinghua is close to universally regarded as the top school for engineering, mathematics and the sciences in China. I attended a graduate course in random signal analysis at a renowned American university that was filled with many graduates of Tsinghua. Suffice it to say, I was very impressed with the mathematical aptitude of this set of Chinese students."
Is Groupon A Takeover Target?,Nov. 9.15,"This is one assessor's take on Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) wretched reputation in the investment community compounded by wicked Q3 financials. They are so shocking the board and persuasive investors were forced within hours of public release to exercise long overdue fiduciary responsibility and remove the co-founder and CEO. Nevertheless the Q3 financials are another shock to believers in Groupon's mission. Those data need not be repeated, because they do not tell the story of this company's true potential value.There are plenty of other reports using technical data analyses giving rise to the wailing keeners. I believe fundamental analyses of other conditions suggest the company is prime for a buyout or takeover where patient investors can recoup much of our money if not turn a profit. Furthermore, the Q3 financials lead me to believe it is a good time for investors with high conviction and risk tolerance to buy the stock and I'm putting my money behind that bet.Other fed up and frothing analysts are avoiding any buys of Groupon stock in the near term. One analyst called the Q3 financials the worst earnings report with terrible operating numbers, flat user growth, revenue troubles and no real earnings. Capital was siphoned off from pursuing more acquisitions for the buybacks and marketing not yielding enough return on investment. Guidance for Q4 does not look better and lower for 2016.The hopelessness and negativity are all about Groupon's management and the board's appearance of insouciance. The frustration is so pervasive that the 31% free fall of share price was not abated even with the announcement about the CEO's replacement. Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE: HPE) fared better when Carly Fiorina was let go - the stock rose 6.9% on that announcement."
Stratasys: A Value Stock In A Growth Industry,Jul.10.15,"By Tasha Keeney, Analyst: Industrial InnovationDown 70% from its peak and trading at 80% of book, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) has become a value stock in a growth industry. Clearly, fears of share loss, platform obsolescence, and/or commoditization have discouraged investors. To justify this valuation, however, Stratasys's market share loss during the next few years would have to be dramatic.Joining Stratasys, share prices of 3D printing manufacturers 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) also fell 70% since their peaks in the last year, but contrary to these stocks' recent behavior, the 3D printing industry still is in a rapid growth phase. Analysts expect the market to grow by 20-54% per year between 2015 and 2020 and, as shown below, Wohler's estimates have been revised up roughly three-fold during the past two years.Source: Wohler'sBased on these estimates, there is room for growth for all players in the industry. With 18% share of the entire printer market, and more than 50% of the more profitable industrial printer market, Stratasys should be poised to benefit from the anticipated boom in 3D printing, even if it loses significant market share.The company's market cap is $1.7 billion (as of 7.6.15.), a fraction of the $12-56 billion in revenues that the industry could generate by 2020. In the worst case scenario, as shown below, if Stratasys were to lose up to 80% of its market share and its price-to-sales ratio were to erode from 2.5 to 1, its stock would end up at today's price in 2020. In other words, thanks to growth in the 3D printing market, SSYS could ""run in place"", even in the face of horrible headwinds. Alternatively, if the company were to maintain its current market share and price-to-sales ratio, its stock would appreciate somewhere between 3- and 14-fold. If it were to gain share, just imagine … [sources for graph]"
Pure Storage IPO: Optimally Positioned To Monetize Storage Market Changes,Sep.29.15,"As equity markets slowed down worldwide in the last couple of months, the IPO market experienced very little activity in August and September with no significant tech IPO in that period. The Pure Storage (Pending:PSTG) IPO is about to break the trend and become the first significant tech IPO in a while.Pure Storage is a data storage company that offers a unique cost-saving solution that replaces traditional rack-based mechanical disk storage with flash-based storage. The flash-based storage provides better performance at a lower cost that utilizes all the advantages of flash over disk-based storage:Dramatically improved performance to keep up with the demands of the business.Reliability, security and data management services for operating in mission-critical environments.Seamless interoperability for compatibility with existing IT infrastructure investments.Simplicity, agility, easy automation and elasticity to enable the cloud model for IT.Greater price performance and reduced total cost of ownership.Pure Storage has a unique SW/HW solution that claims to save $2.4M when transferring a 50TB disk-based storage system to flash array storage, assuming a 10% storage growth rate. The company's solution contains three components:Purity Operating Environment - A flash-optimized software solution.Flash Array - Custom-made hardware components designed to maximize flash storage density and maximize the performance of the Purity Operating Environment in a way that minimizes solution costs for customers.Pure 1 management and support - A cloud-based platform that simplifies data center management and enables customers to monitor their global storage deployment from every device.Historically, the data center storage market has been based on disk storage, requiring frequent capex upgrades, maintenance, support and a large physical space to host the storage machines. With flash arrays, companies can transition to more efficient and cost-effective storage. The flash array market size is estimated to be between $1.5B and $2B, and the players in that market are the usual known storage titans: EMC (EMC), NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Dell. However, one significant player in the flash array storage market is focused solely on excelling in that niche - Pure Storage."
AMD Denies Spin-Off Story But An Independent Radeon GPU Firm Is Still An Attractive Concept,Jun.21.15,"AMD Spokesperson Sarah Youngbauer has officially denied Liana B. Baker's (of Reuters) story alleging Dr. Lisa Su was asking consultants over the viability of splitting Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). However, I still firmly believe that an entirely independent Radeon GPU outfit could be a long-term winner.Radical tactics are sometimes needed during desperate times. AMD is in a quandary right now. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is lording it over on x86 desktop and server processors. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has also grossly outperformed sales of Radeon GPU over the last two years.A partial image below shows that almost 3 out of 4 PC gamers now use Nvidia GPU cards.(Source: DSO Gaming/dbz)I opine that untethering the Radeon division from AMD's backyard could help it chase Nvidia. The new firm could be run without the handicap of debt payments (incurred from acquiring the old ATI Radeon assets) and noise from catering to low-end APUs.I agree with Barron's hypothesis that AMD could also regain its lost market share in GPU from the upcoming release of Windows 10 and DirectX 12. AMD's latest flagship GPU products are now on par with Nvidia GPUs' performance.The $650 Radeon R9 Fury X is allegedly the world's fastest single-GPU product today. The water-cooled R9 Fury X has slightly better 4K gaming benchmark scores than the $760 Nvidia GTX 980ti."
Proofpoint Proves It's Worth Shorting,Nov. 4.15,"Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT) is a security-as-a-service vendor that delivers data-protection solutions including threat protection, regulatory compliance, data governance and eDiscovery, and secure communication.

"Hewlett Packard Enterprise - Enterprise Service Spin-Off Makes Sense, Reveals Value Of The Core",May.27.16,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) announced a major move alongside its quarterly results. The company will spin-off its troubled enterprise service segment, as that business will consequently be merged with CSC (CSC).The spin-off, and consequent merger of the service business, appears to be value enhancing for investors in HPE. The company will reinforce its balance sheet and get rid of a struggling business unit. Investors will obtain nearly $5 in value per share through a special dividend and equity stake in CSC.The improved, but smaller core of HPE looks quite promising, creating relative good appeal at current levels. This is certainly the case as second quarter revenue trends looked quite robust.News Flow, Spinning Off Enterprise ServicesHPE announced that it will spin-off the enterprise service segment in a deal valued at $8.5 billion. The consulting business is facing real pressure as revenues fell by nearly 12% in 2015 to $19.8 billion. While the business managed to report an increase in segment earnings, which rose towards $1.0 billion, the real profitability has been much lower. It is important to realize that segment earnings do not factor in the allocation of sizable corporate costs.The $8.5 billion deal tag is comprised out of three separate items. Investors in HPE will see a special dividend of $1.5 billion, which is equivalent to roughly $0.85 per share. CSC will furthermore assume $2.5 billion in debt and other liabilities, as investors will get a $4.5 billion equity stake in CSC.The $4.5 billion value equity stake in CSC was based on a share price of $35 per share. The huge increase in CSC's stock price, in response to the merger with HP's service segment, means that the value of the stake is now valued at around $6.5 billion. This increases the effective value of the deal to roughly $10.5 billion."
"CSC: Merger With HP´s Enterprise Service Business Is A Major Deal, Creating Risks As Well",May.25.16,"HP Enterprise (HPE) and CSC (CSC) announced quite a complicated deal overnight with large implications for investors. Both companies are the result of a split up which took place in recent times. Following all this ¨cutting¨ of businesses, HPE is now spinning off its enterprise service business which will be merged with CSC.The deal is quite complicated but investors like the renewed activity, mostly on the back of promise of large cost synergy estimates. While the deal looks good on paper, I question the viability of the deal in the long run as two challenged businesses will be combined.The challenged long term prospects, distracting integration process, and optimistic synergy estimates, make this a ¨show me¨ story.HP EnterpriseHP Enterprise came into existence when Hewlett-Packard got split up last year into HPE and HP Inc. The overall enterprise business has been struggling as revenues have fallen from $62 billing in 2011 towards $52 billion by 2015.The business pretty much exists out of two large components, being the $28 billion enterprise group (servers, networking, storage) and the $20 billion enterprise service segment. These are complemented by a +$3 billion software and +$3 billion financial service segment.It is the $20 billion enterprise service segment which gets spun-off and is facing pressure from the transition to the cloud. This move can really be seen in the results of the enterprise business as revenues still came in at $24 billion in 2013. Despite the dismal revenue trends, the segment has improved segment operating margins from roughly 3% of sales in 2013 towards 5-6% by now.These margin improvements result in segment operating earnings of roughly $1 billion. The problem is that this number does not include the allocation of HPE´s corporate costs. Corporate costs of HPE totaled $4.1 billion in the year 2015. These costs are responsible for the major discrepancy between the $5.6 billion in segment operating earnings, and the $1.5 billion company-wide operating earnings being reported in 2015.It should be said that this $4.1 billion cost allocation did include one-time costs such as restructuring, impairment and separation costs. On the other hand, given that the business is shrinking, many of these costs will actually come back in the upcoming periods.Real corporate costs, stock-based compensation expenses, and ¨structural¨ restructuring charges came in at $2.0 billion for 2015. This seems a conservative estimate for HPE´s real corporate costs that year. Given that the enterprise segment generated 40% of the overall revenues of HPE in 2015, we could allocate $800 million of these corporate costs to this segment.With segment operating earnings totaling $1 billion, and given the $800 million corporate costs allocation, the real operating earnings of the segment might just total $200 million. I would like to stress that I have been kind with regards to the cost allocation as HPE took significant amortization charges, acquisition-related costs and pension-related charges as well.Trends have not improved a lot in the first half of this year. Given the continued declines in revenues, the run rate for the enterprise service business in terms of sales is now seen around $19 billion. While segment margins improved towards 6%, allowing for potential segment earnings of $1.1 billion, the allocation of corporate costs will ¨eat¨ up the majority of these segment earnings.The Spin-Off DetailsThe press release states that investors in HPE will receive $8.5 billion for the enterprise service segment as it will merge with CSC, which is actually smaller in terms of size.Investors in HPE will receive a $1.5 billion special dividend, as CSC will take assume $2.5 billion in debt and related liabilities. Investors in HPE will furthermore receive a 50% equity stake in the newly created company with a $4.5 billion valuation based on CSC´s share price at around $35.Note that CSC has 138 million shares outstanding which traded at $35 before the deal has been announced. This $4.8 billion equity valuation matches the $4.5 billion in value which investors in HPE will receive, indicating that both parties end up with a roughly 50/50% stake in the new entity.What Does CSC Bring To The Table?Like HPE, CSC has been actively involved in splitting up the business itself in recent times. It has split up its commercial and public sector activities in two separate companies.CSC actually reported its fourth quarter results alongside the announcement of the deal. The global business service and global infrastructure service segment generated $7.1 billion in sales for the year which ended in April. Similar to HPE´s enterprise service business, revenues are falling at CSC as well.Full year sales fell 12.5%, although half of that can be explained by the impact of a strong dollar. Constant currency sales declines slowed down to just 2.4% in the final quarter, although that can in part be explained by dealmaking. CSC reported relatively healthy segment operating margins of 7% of sales, but just like HPE, this is before the allocation of corporate expenses.The reality is that CSC is not very profitable either. If I exclude restructuring, separation and debt extinguishment costs, I arrive at operating profits of merely $150 million for the year.CSC holds roughly $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents at the moment. Total debt, including roughly $300 million in pension-related obligations, stands at nearly $3.0 billion. This net debt load of $1.8 billion will increase towards $5.8 billion following the merger with HP enterprise services. The $4 billion run-up in debt results from the $1.5 billion dividend, which is to be paid to HPE, as well as the assumption of $2.5 billion in debt.The New Tie-UpThe new combination will post sales of roughly $26 billion, comprised out of $19 billion in sales from the legacy HPE business and $7 billion from CSC.Segment earnings come in at just $200 million for the HPE business (after allocating corporate costs) and $150 million for CSC, (again after allocating corporate costs). This EBIT of $350 million is miniscule, yet depreciation and amortization costs are relatively large at $600 million per annum for CSC. Total D&A costs for HPE amounted to $4 billion in 2015, as a 40% allocation for the enterprise segment amounts to $1.6 billion. That suggests that D&amp;A charges for the combination could total $2.2 billion per annum, translating into EBITDA of some $2.6 billion a year.The $350 million in combined EBIT leaves few profits with a net debt load of $5.8 billion. A 5% interest rate on that debt load results in $290 million in interest expenses, translating into an essential break-even result. There are two important caveats however.For starters is the fact that the business is shrinking, allowing capital expenditures to come in lower than the combined depreciation and amortization charges of $2.2 billion. This results in cash flows, even if the company is breaking-even on the bottom line.The other big issue is the ¨promise¨ of $1.5 billion in costs synergies, as this run rate should already be achieved in year one after the deal will close. This is a huge amount in relation to the nature of the business and as a percentage of revenues, indicating that many jobs will be lost. The realization of these synergies involves upfront costs of some $900 million, most likely used to pay out many severance packages.Lets assume that these synergies can be achieved. Pro-forma EBIT of $350 million could jump to $1.8 billion by 2018, assuming no deterioration of the revenue base going forwards (which seems optimistic). After subtracting $300 million in interest costs, and assuming statutory tax rates, GAAP earnings could come in at roughly $1 billion per year.Now realize that CSC has 138 million shares outstanding, a number which will double overnight as a result of the deal. These 276 million shares rallied sharply towards $45 in response to the deal, creating an equity valuation of $12.5 billion. That suggests that a realization of the synergies could result in a 12-13 times earnings multiple by 2018. While cash flow yields could be better than actual earnings (given that investments lag compared to depreciation charges), this calculation assumes a full realization of optimistic synergy estimates as well as no further declines in revenues.The debt load of $5.8 billion should be more manageable if synergies can be achieved. EBITDA could improve from $2.6 billion towards $4 billion if the deal works out, for a manageable leverage ratio of 1.5 times. That being said, leverage remains tricky for a structurally challenged business which is failing to report real earnings at the moment.Investors Sheer, A Word Of CautionInvestor in CSC sheer about the headline of $1.5 billion in synergies. This is a huge amount given that equity in CSC was valued at nearly $5 billion ahead of the deal.The reality is that two declining businesses are combined, as this combination process might create its own challenges. Just realize that HPE sold a business with $20 billion in sales for $8.5 billion, for a 0.4 sales multiple. The new CSC/HPE will generate $26 billion in sales but has a combined enterprise valuation of $18 billion at the moment after the market reacted positively in response to the deal. The pro-forma business now trades at 0.7 times sales, indicating the HPE sold the business too cheap, or CSC has a lot to prove going forwards.A distracting merging process for two shrinking businesses can be distracting. This is certainly the case as the most important assets for both businesses are its people, as morale might not be very high with another round of job cuts being effectively announced. The other issues are the lack of current profits and optimistic synergy estimates. While $1.5 billion in cost synergies amount to 6% of pro-forma sales, these are asset light businesses. It seems that deal synergies are used as a ¨replacement¨ for another round of job cuts.While HPE´s CEO Meg Whitman stressed that these synergies are all incremental on top of current plans, the new CSC will be a ¨show me¨ story for me going forwards. Real value can be delivered if the company delivers on synergies and manages to stabilize the topline, as I have my doubts."
Assessing HP Inc. After The Split,May.10.16,"OverviewOn November 1, 2015, Hewlett-Packard Company divided into two new companies: Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) and HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ). I will try to assess post-split prospects for the development of HP Inc., which specializes in personal computer systems (PCs) and printing hardware (along with supplies for it).Competitor analysisI will compare HP with four other companies from the same industry. The first one is Lenovo Group Limited (OTCPK:LNVGY), which reported 2015 sales of $47.11 billion. The second company is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. (OTC:ASUUY), with $13.49 billion in sales in 2015. The third is IBM (NYSE:IBM), having 2015 sales of $81.74 billion. The last company is Canon, Inc. (NYSE:CAJ), with sales constituting $34.18 billion in 2015.Sales analysisA decreasing trend can be seen in sales of the former Hewlett-Packard. The company reported sales of $103.36 billion for the fiscal year of 2015. This was a decrease of 7.3% vs. 2014.Figure 1 - Sales at HP Inc., US $ billionsTable 1 - Sales comparison - most recent quarter, US $ billionsThe amount of sales per employee in HP is median compared to its competitors.In the first quarter of 2016, sales at HP totaled $12.25 billion. This is 0.2% and 11.6% smaller q-o-q and y-o-y (Table 1). Most competitors also showed a decrease in sales. Only ASUSTeK presented a positive change from 2014 Q4 to 2015 Q4."
HP Market Cap Same As Cash On Balance Sheet: Little Downside Risk,Feb. 8.16,"On November 1, 2015, Hewlett-Packard Company split into two companies; HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE). The two companies are completely split with HPQ not owning any part of HPE so you can now think of HPQ as suppliers of printers and computers. Even before the split, the stock price had been beaten down over the years and now HPQ sports a price-to-earnings ratio below 4 as of February 7, 2016.With the recent stock market sell-off so far in 2016, some companies will be knocked down to create bargains. Right now I cannot find a stock pick that has as little downside as HPQ and the reason can be easily summarized in one comparison.Market cap as of market close February 5, 2016: $17.76 Billion. Cash and cash equivalents on balance sheet: $17.43 Billion.There has been a lot of negative news on HPQ and the reasons are very sound: A challenging printer and computer market with prices and margins dropping, an old corporate structure that does not allow HPQ to quickly adapt to changing market conditions as nimbly as newer corporations (another example is IBM), and not seeing the growing 3-D printing market and getting far behind companies like 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS). These are all valid reasons, but basically at this market cap, you are giving away the entire business for free and HPQ is still making money. Below is a chart showing the last time the cross between cash on balance and market cap and the subsequent price action."

What Is Computer Sciences Up To?,May.25.16,"Just last year, Computer Sciences (CSC) spun out its public sector business to CSRA (NYSE:CSRA), handing shareholders a $10.50/share windfall, but cutting its stock price in half.The deal with SRA International was hailed by analysts as getting CSC out of what was becoming a commodity business. Since then, CSRA is down 20%, as it tries to migrate federal agencies to cloud.Now, it seems it's getting right back in, taking on Hewlett Packard Enterprises' (NYSE:HPE) government business in an $8.5 billion deal. The deal sent CSC up 30% in overnight trading.What CSC is getting is what is left of Electronic Data Systems, purchased by HP (NYSE:HPQ) for about $13 billion in 2008. The valuation this time is lower because the old EDS has since lost a bunch of its customers, with revenue declining from $26 billion in 2012 to $19.8 billion last year.CSC said it expects $1 billion in ""cost savings"" from the deal, which will also put HPE CEO Meg Whitman on its board. The deal is considered to be yet another masterstroke for CSC CEO Mike Lawrie, who came on board in 2012 when the stock was in the 20s, with the charge of increasing it 80% in five years. Before the CSRA spin-off, the stock was trading near $70, and Lawrie is now chairman of CSRA as well as holding his CSC position (Who's your daddy, Jack Dorsey?).The timing of the deal for traders was excellent, as CSC also announced earnings that blew away analyst estimates, following the purchases of UXC and Xchanging. Net income for the year came in at $65 million against a loss a year ago, and after many adjustments, it added up to 45 cents/share.Lawrie, now 62, has been fitting companies together and breaking them apart for a decade, having come to CSC from Misys plc (OTC:MUSJF), whose health IT assets it spun out into Allscripts (NASDAQ:MDRX), which has since gone nowhere despite computing for billions in stimulus through the HITECH Act (The winner there, when all was said and done, turned to be AthenaHealth (NASDAQ:ATHN), up almost 247% since the act was passed)."

"IDC's Cloud Forecast Spells Trouble For HPE, EMC, And NetApp, And An Opportunity For Others",Apr.11.16,"46% of all spending on ""IT infrastructure"" (referred to as servers, storage, and switches) will go towards cloud infrastructures by 2020, predicts IDC. A lot of that growth will come at the expense of traditional data center infrastructure gear, whose spending share is expected to drop to 54% from 69.8% in 2015.IDC sees spending on traditional gear declining at a 1.3% CAGR from 2015-2020. That estimate might be conservative, given a 4% drop is expected in 2016. Forex is admittedly a 2016 headwind. Gartner has forecast total 2016 IT spend (whether on-premise or cloud) will drop 0.5% in 2016, with forex and international macro pressures weighing on sales.Meanwhile, spending on cloud infrastructure gear is expected to see a 12.5% CAGR, with public and private cloud spending respectively growing at 13.8% and 10.2% compound annual rates. 30.2% of 2020 server/storage/switch spend is expected to go towards public clouds, and 15.8% towards private clouds. A lot of that spending will go to contract manufacturers of white-box hardware, such as Quanta, Wistron, and Compal.

ServiceNow - Paying For Patent Infringement,Apr.14.16,"I have been negative on ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) for going on a year and a half now, with core unprofitability and high stock-based compensation as my driving thesis, but with patent infringement lawsuits as a final kicker.For example, in an article written in Nov 2014, I mentioned both the patent infringement case levied by HP (NYSE:HPQ), and more importantly that brought by BMC. The tenor of the pleadings in the BMC case in particular made me believe that ""BMC appears to be taking NOW's potential infringement ""personally"" which could be very costly for NOW."" I provided several details from the cases, including that NOW didn't have a single patent to its name and that BMC had made the following accusation:18. ServiceNow has made it clear that the ultimate goal of its infringing activities is to destroy BMC's reputation and business. Among other things, ServiceNow's Chief Executive Officer Frank Slootman has gone on record with statements about BMC such as:(i) ""We have been dismantling [BMC's] business left, right, and center.""(ii) ""We have taken the whole company down.""(iii) ""I fear for their future because we're going to drive a truck right through it . . . .""In December of 2015, I followed up on my thesis, including highlighting a third party appraisal of the suits, which included this conclusion regarding the initial Markman hearing in the BMC case:In this instance, the ruling was almost entirely in BMC's favor, which suggests that ServiceNow's position may be untenable and/or its litigation team is overmatched. Given the history with HP, both have a relatively high probability of being true and, in fact, the harder it is to win a case the more competent the legal team has to be to prevail. This ruling suggests that BMC's team is adequately provisioned, while ServiceNow's is not.While this doesn't assure BMC will win, it gives it a significant advantage going into the trial because the battle has been defined in accordance with BMC's wishes. This would be like a duel where one side can pick both the location and weapons before going into the battle and, as you would expect, is particularly proficient with the choices it made."
Power Up Your Income With 14% Yields From Kemet Corporation's May 2018 Bonds,May.22.16,"This week, we revisit a market leader in the development and manufacture of capacitors, and the largest manufacturer of tantalum capacitors. Kemet Corporation (NYSE:KEM) has recently concluded its restructuring of its business units and has continued to increase its profitability.The company aims to complete its acquisition of NEC Tokin this year, which should quickly be accretive to the company's sales and profitability. Between FY 2013 and FY 2015, NEC Tokin grew adjusted EBITDA by over 700%.The company has more than doubled cash levels over the past four quarters, from $32.9 million to $65 million with another $25 to $30 million expected additions by year-end.In its most recent fiscal year (FY) 2016 results (ending March 31, 2016), Kemet again grew its gross margin over the previous year, from 19.4% in FY 2015 to 22.2% in FY 2016.Kemet recently announced a bond repurchase of up to $20 million this fiscal year.These bonds are a fantastic opportunity for investors to diversify into the electronics industry with a market leader who is not only growing, but solidifying its balance sheet as well. In light of the company's solid results and improving balance sheet, we have marked these higher yielding and high cash flow bonds for additional weighting in both our FX1 and FX2 global high yield Fixed Income portfolios.NEC Tokin AcquisitionIn 2012, Kemet acquired a 34% stake in NEC Tokin, a joint venture with Japan's NEC corporation. Based in Tokyo, NEC Tokin manufactures tantalum, electromagnetic and electromechanical capacitors and access devices. Since that time, Kemet has been instrumental in NEC Tokin's growth. Between FY 2013 (ending 3/31/2013) and FY 2016, NEC Tokin's revenues grew by $124 million to $492 million. More impressively, adjusted EBITDA improved over that same time period from $9 million in 2013 to $73.6 million, an increase of over 700%.Now, Kemet is in the final stages of acquiring the remaining shares of NEC Tokin, to be completed by the end of this year. As Kemet's CEO Per Loof, stated, ""We do believe that the NEC Tokin acquisition should be a significant event and potential game changer for Kemet, providing increased shareholder value.""Cash is KingOver the past few quarters, Kemet has continued to increase its cash levels.June 2015 $32.9 M in cashSept 2015 $39.2 M in cashDec 2015 $43.2 M in cashMar 2016 $65.0 M in cashIn addition, on its most recent quarterly results conference call, the company indicated that it expects to grow cash by another $25 to $30 million by year-end. With the marked increase in its cash levels, it comes as little surprise that the company has initiated a buy-back of its outstanding bonds. At the conclusion of its fiscal year 2016 (ending March 31, 2016), Kemet's Board of Directors authorized a debt repurchase plan, initially up to $20 million over the course of the company's fiscal year 2017 (beginning April 1, 2016), with a goal of lowering ongoing interest payments and improving the company's balance sheet.Kemet has also actively monitored the outstanding balance of their credit revolver over the past year. The company paid down $9.6 million on its revolver during FY 2016. In addition, the bank that holds the company's revolver recently increased the borrowing amount from $60 million to $65 million, an indication of the company's improving financial position.Restructuring CompletedWe reviewed Kemet Corporation in July 2012 and again in November 2015. At our last review, the company was in process of concluding its restructuring of its Film and Electrolytic Business Group. As part of the restructuring of this group, Kemet reduced headcount by 240 employees between September 2014 and December 2015. These reductions have translated to cost reductions of $5.0 million per quarter.About the IssuerKEMET Laboratories was founded by Union Carbide in 1919, and KEMET Corporation became a US listed company in 1992. Headquartered in Simpsonville, SC and employing about 9,800 people worldwide, KEMET has 20 manufacturing facilities in Mexico, China, Indonesia, Europe, and the United States. KEMET's extensive network of global distribution partners serve a customer base that includes nearly all of the world's major electronics original equipment manufacturers - including Alcatel-Lucent (OTCPK:ALALF), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bosch, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Continental AG, Dell, Hewlett- Packard (NYSE:HPE), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Motorola (NYSE:MSI), Nokia (NYSE:NOK), and TRW - electronics manufacturing services providers - including Celestica (NYSE:CLS), Flextronics International (FLES), Jabil Circuit (NYSE:JBL), Sanmina-SCI (SAMN) - and distributors - including TTI, Arrow Electronics (NYSE:ARW) and Avnet (NYSE:AVT).KEMET is a global manufacturer of multilayer ceramic, solid & electrolytic aluminum, tantalum and film capacitors. Capacitors are passive electronic components that store, filter, and regulate electrical energy and current flow. Capacitors come in various shapes and sizes with a myriad of technical specifications, and are required in anything that has an electric current (from iPods to giant windmills.) They are numerous in some devices, with over 3000 utilized in some flat panel TV's and over 700 in some smartphones. Capacitors are typically used to filter out interference, smooth the output of power supplies, block the flow of direct current while allowing alternating current to pass and for many other purposes. Generally, ceramic capacitors are more cost-effective at lower capacitance values, and tantalum capacitors are more cost-effective at higher capacitance values.Kemet operates three business lines; Tantalum capacitors, Ceramic capacitors and Film and Electrolytic capacitors. Based on net sales, Kemet is the largest manufacturer of tantalum capacitors in the world.Diversification Across IndustriesKemet's capacitors have various uses across many different industries. Here is a breakdown of the different industries that made up the company's fiscal year 2016 revenues.Computer 15%Industrial 23%Consumer 8%Defense 6%Medical 7%Telecom 21%Automotive 20%Industry GrowthAccording to a 2015 report by Paumanok Publications, a market research firm that focuses on the passive components industry, the global capacitor market in fiscal year 2015 was estimated to be $18.2 billion in revenues and 1.76 trillion units. According to the report, the global capacitor market is expected to improve substantially and achieve revenue and unit volume increases of 14% and 19% respectively by fiscal year 2020.Capacitors are a fundamental component of electronic circuits. As such, demand for capacitors generally follows demand for electronic products, as well as integrated circuits, which, though cyclical, continues to increase. Kemet believes growth in the electronics market and the resulting increasing demand for capacitors will be driven by several factors: development of new products (alternative energy systems, hybrid transportation, smart phones, mobile personal computing devices), increasing electronic content in existing products such as home appliances and automobiles, and consumer desire for mobility and connectivity.FinancialsKemet recently posted its Q4 and fiscal year (FY) 2016 results. The company continues to make progress towards increasing profitability after its restructuring efforts. For fiscal year 2016, Kemet's gross margin increased to 22.2% as compared to its fiscal year 2015's gross margin of 19.4%. Operating income for FY 2016 also showed an impressive increase, coming in at $32.3 million as compared to FY 2015's $22.4 million, an outstanding increase of 44%. Finally, net sales also increased over the previous quarter by 3.8%.Kemet's adjusted EBITDA for FY 2016 registered at $91.14 million, with interest expense coming in at $39.61 million. Adjusted EBITDA to interest expense for FY 2016 calculates to 2.3x. This metric should improve over the course of this next year as Kemet pays down its debt, thereby decreasing annual interest expense. In addition, the completion of the NEC Tokin acquisition and the associated increase in adjusted EBITDA should bring coverage close to 3x.RisksThe default risk is Kemet's ability to perform. The company continues to increase its profitability as evidenced by its continued growth in its gross margin. Restructuring is now behind them and the company has consistently grown its cash levels over the past four quarters. Its debt repurchase plan this fiscal year will reduce its long-term debt by $20 million as well as reduce the company's annual interest expense. The extremely attractive yields on these 24-month bonds appear to outweigh the risks identified here.Kemet's NEC Tokin recently reached a preliminary settlement with plaintiffs in two antitrust class action suits. In consideration of its release from the class action suits, NEC Tokin will pay $37.25 million to a settlement class of direct and indirect purchasers of capacitors. The payments will be made in annual installments extending through December 2019. While Kemet is still waiting for certain government jurisdictions to complete their review of the case and assess any potential liability, this agreement clears a significant hurdle in Kemet's acquisition of NEC Tokin.These short 24-month bonds have similar yields and durations to other bonds reviewed on Bond-Yields.com, such as the 16.5% Iconix Brand Group bonds and the 12.15% IBI Group convertible debentures.Summary and ConclusionFrom its growing cash levels, its increasing gross margins, to its recent decision to reduce its debt by $20 million this fiscal year, Kemet is doing all the right things. Its pending full acquisition of NEC Tokin will add additional revenue streams and products to Kemet's already competitive suite of products across various industries. These short 24-month bonds provide investors with an excellent opportunity to diversify into the electronics industry with a very sweet bond yielding about 14%. The recent announcement of its bond repurchase program has not only hiked the price for these bonds, but interest level as well, and we have chosen them for additional weighting to our global high yield fixed income portfolios, Fixed-Income1.com and Fixed-Income2.com.Issuer: KEMET CorporationCoupon: 10.5%Ratings: Caa1/B-Maturity: 5/01/2018CUSIP: 488360AF5Pays: Semi-annuallyPrice: 94.25Yield to Maturity: ~13.98%To obtain higher yields and keep costs as low as possible, Durig Capital typically bundles smaller retail orders into larger institutional sized orders with many global trading firms and bond platforms.Disclosure: Durig Capital and certain clients may have a position in Kemet Corporate bonds.Please note that all yield and price indications are shown from the time of our research.

Just scratch the surface of this Luxembourg company and you'll find enough Quasimodo-esque characteristics to send this stock running into an ugly, rapid decline.Indeed, Globant's SEC filings are unique as it conjures up beautiful - and vague - visions of the business: ""Globant (NYSE: GLOB) is a digitally native technology services company. We dream and build digital journeys that matter to millions of users. We are the place where engineering, design, and innovation meet scale.""Plow through all that dreamy wording and investors find a company with a bank of computer programmers and design support people primarily working out of the main office in Argentina.Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, diligent investors can see growing risks are tarnishing Globant's glowing digital dream, including:*1. Limited Recurring RevenueThough it has attracted customers such as Coca-Cola and LAN Airlines, Globant must operate within an atmosphere of transient customers and short-term contracts.What happens is that Globant wins these one-time projects but once they're done, they're done. The customer says ""Thanks,"" pays up and takes the project in-house to save on costs. Globant clearly concedes that risk to revenue on page 21 as it describes ""a decision by that client to move work in-house.""Alternatively, Globant says the customer may decide to move work ""to one or several of our competitors.""Company filings describe the risky short-term nature of most contracts:""...most of our client contracts are limited to short-term, discrete projects without any commitment to a specific volume of business or future work, and the volume of work performed for a specific client is likely to vary from year to year, especially since we are generally not our clients' exclusive technology services provider. A major client in one year may not provide the same level of revenues for us in any subsequent year.""Globant has been handling some Google projects, including the recent hardware related project trial called Project Ara. This trial has no time table attached and provides a pretty good example of how companies use Globant on a project basis.In a recent note to BWS Financial investors, Hamed Khorsand beautifully explained Google's project-based use of Globant ... and the associated risk:""The project based approach leads us to believe that the Street is not valuing the business risk concisely and leaves investors vulnerable to the downside especially when the competitive landscape is changing.""It also does not mean GLOB would be able to sustain 20 percent or 30 percent growth in an industry that grows at less than 10 percent a year,"" wrote Mr. Khorsand.So Globant's services, in our opinion, cannot generate the kind of recurring revenue that is so crucial to a viable future.*2. Reinventing The WheelSo the short-term nature of the technology services business is forcing Globant to find new customer after new customer.Unfortunately, this constant grinding away each day to reinvent the wheel is beginning to show on the company.Globant says so itself.The company reported 344 customers in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, it reported 343 customers. That means it took an entire quarter to add just one customer.Meanwhile, Globant's competition is screaming and beating its chest like the well-financed gorilla it really is, knocking down hundreds of times greater revenue than Globant:(Source: Morningstar)Stacked against the competition, Globant costs about twice as much as IBM (NYSE: IBM), Hewlett Packard Enterprise and other monsters - a 32.71 price-to-earnings ratio versus about 15 industry wide - despite offering far, far less in income and margins.In brief, here's how those numbers break out. The industry's average income is $49 billion versus Globant's $31 million. Of 26 stocks selected by Morningstar, only nine rivals offer operating margins lower than Globant's 5.7. Yet 16 rivals offer superior operating margins. And a dozen of those competitors even offer double-digit operating margins.And, in this environment populated by better-resourced, global IT and technology service providers, Globant may find each new customer will be more difficult to attract.*3. Extreme CompetitionAnd Globant's competition is growing. That competition comes from literally thousands of IT outsourcing companies working across the globe. These range from U.S.-based monsters like Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ: CTSH) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE), to big Indian companies like Infosys and WiPro, to smaller regional companies.But let's focus on one mighty rival.Indian tech services giant Infosys (NYSE: INFY,~$18 per share) is a great example of an outsourcing firm that is one-upping Globant primarily through its investment in Internet of Things and digital engineering.In early 2015, Infosys acquired an automation software maker. Then a few months later, Infosys jumped in to acquire Skava, a former gaming company that switched to a business like Globant's, helping big retailers such as Toys R Us, Gap and Staples make more money from their websites, mobile apps and in-store platforms. Infosys noted that Skava's business grew 300 percent in two years, settling in by 2013 to produce $22 million in revenue.Meanwhile, the year-to-date stock chart indicates investors' confidence in Infosys:(Source: Morningstar)When we take a closer look at the numbers of both Globant and Infosys, we see Globant is inferior in virtually every meaningful metric.(Sources: Morningstar here, here, SEC filings)Indeed, we think both Infosys and Globant are absurdly overvalued. But Globant is worse:(Source:Yahoo Finance)*4. Recent Earnings Report Confirms Downside RiskIn the recent fourth quarter/yearly earnings call, Globant reported fourth quarter results were slightly ahead of consensus estimates and 2016 guidance in line with estimates.But key factors behind the results further support downside worries.Globant is having to add employees as it opens new offices, putting more pressure on its operating margins.Those margins have plummeted:(Source: Capitalcube.com)Globant sustained a stunning drop in operating margins to 8.63 percent from 10.33 percent the previous year.So management talked about hitting scale but the higher costs of adding employees in new offices are actually cutting into margins.And those margins will probably sustain more whittling as additional projects produce additional costs.*5. Peso Comments Support Rising Costs TheoryThese additional operating costs were hidden by the devaluation of the peso in Argentina, where the vast majority of Globant's workers are based.Here's a snapshot from the earnings call surprise that Globant sprang on analysts:Citigroup Analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar""My last question is - when you have the - the Argentine peso devaluation, is that a follow-through impact - or what is the follow-through impact with regards to [evaluation] and how we're thinking about this, as we approach this year?""CFO Alejandro Scannapieco""Hi Ashwin, this is Alejandro. That's still to be, to be seen. The way we see the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation - definitely very positive in terms of margins, gross margins, operating margins.""Very positive in terms of having [motch] (NYSE:PH) interview of her analysis, now in the [indiscernible] is going to be a minimized or just going away. As for weight inflation, we know that the government is having, a tough fight with unions, in terms of setting up expectations, but they are also working on their monetary policy and the public expenditure in terms of controlling inflation. They are very vocal about lowering inflation, so I think in the long run it is going to be a positive.""The scenario for 2016 is still going to be a shaky environment from a wage inflation perspective in Argentina. But we are very positive in - as I was saying we're very positive in terms of what is happening in the market, both in terms of the government change and what is happening in the FX market as well.""This peso impact didn't seem to be included in consensus estimates and indicates why the company offers only inline earnings guidance. So management's comments - indicating the devalued peso will boost profit - supports the indication that costs are rising and will continue to rise. Even if the peso strengthens by mid-year, that would remove the cost savings that would likely otherwise allow Globant to hit its numbers.*6. Good-bye First Mover AdvantageMeanwhile, Globant appears to be going the way of former rock star BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY). Many companies initially whole-heartedly embraced the popular devices until Apple introduced iPhone and Google introduced Android.But, writing in the New York Times, the words Robert Cyran and Peter Thal Larsen penned in July 2010 proved quite prophetic:""The BlackBerry maker's shares may appear cheap. They trade at 10 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year. Yet Apple and Google's dominance in apps means they are becoming de facto standards in the smartphone market. Technology companies that lose such wars often suffer shockingly fast profit declines.""Indeed, BlackBerry enjoyed 55 percent of the U.S. market share in 2009. But competitors had begun jack-hammering the smartphone leader, ultimately crushing sales the very next year to only 41 percent market share.Now BlackBerry is left with just 1.2 percent of the market share.""We see no chance that BlackBerry will re-emerge as a leading smartphone maker,"" an analyst recently wrote.It's no shock that BlackBerry stock plummeted from about $80 in 2009 to today's price of about $8:(Source: Morningstar)BlackBerry was trading at 10 times expected future earnings. Globant is trading at 22 times future earnings.And, as we've shown, well-heeled competitors are catching up and pressuring Globant as customers demand ever cooler digital platforms - much like BlackBerry's experience. That first mover advantage is vanishing.The fading advantage, on top of other building issues, may have influenced institutions' recent decisions to cut their positions in Globant. BlackRock Advisors reduced its position by 4 percent in the fourth quarter and Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co. trimmed its stake by 0.7 percent. Also, Sun Trust equities research analysts recently dropped the first quarter estimates for Globant from 25 cents per share to 24 cents per share.*7. The Glitz Is Gone; Analyst Says SellWhile there have been buy ratings, BWS Financial initiated coverage of Globant on Feb. 8 with an unusual ""Sell.""In fact, BWS, which typically goes long, warns there is no room for error with Globant:""It seems investors have been bidding up the stock in hopes that there would be a continuation of multi-million dollar projects in an industry that is highly competitive not just with other companies, but also with in-house development teams,"" wrote Mr. Khorsand.""With no room for error,"" he added, ""investors could be paying a high price for a company that might not have the differentiating glitz that it once had.""*ConclusionJust as various risks intensify, some analysts expect earnings to grow at a 20 percent clip in an industry that grows less than half that rate yearly. Meanwhile, Globant is trading at 30+ percent more than most peers. Something must give.The market likely won't have to wait long. We think the stock price is poised for a screaming ugly drop to $17 per share - still an exceptionally fair valuation for no-longer-glitzy Globant.Disclosure: I am/we are short GLOB."
Will Enterprise Cloud Computing Firms See M&A Spree?,"Feb. 4, 2016 6:15 AM ET","By Mary-Lynn CesarBig firms like IBM (NYSE:IBM) are moving into cloud computing enterprise tech. Acquisitions could make things easier.How do the tech titans of yesteryear stay competitive in 2016? By embracing enterprise technology-sometimes to the tune of billions of dollars. And, as the Wall Street Journal argues, if the market selloff continues, it's quite possible that companies like IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) will drop serious cash to scoop up the competition as they seek to expand their enterprise tech presence.Cloud computing, in particular, is a fast-growing area within enterprise tech, which refers to business-to-business (B2B) offerings that address the complex IT and data needs of large organizations rather than individuals. Forrester, a market research firm, predicts that business spending on cloud computing services will reach $191 billion by 2020, more than double the $72 billion seen in 2014.While demand for cloud computing is on the rise, the shares of these publicly traded companies are a different story. Box (NYSE:BOX), which went public in January 2015, is trading below its IPO price of $14. The cloud storage company's market cap has plummeted from $2.2 billion pre-IPO to $1.3 billion. For comparison, despite losing roughly $3.4 billion off of its market cap since it began trading in November, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is currently worth $23.7 billion.The ongoing market volatility is obviously a drag for everyone, but Hewlett Packard Enterprise and its multi-billion dollar peers are better equipped to weather the storm than smaller, younger firms. As a result, many are expected to use this period of lower valuations to pick off some of the competition."
Flex Inc.: A Wonderful Company At A Fair Price,Jan. 4.16,"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price. —Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway chairman's letter, 1989The name Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) (formerly Flextronics) does not resonate like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) or Ford (NYSE:F), but the popular products the company makes are found everywhere. The company was founded by Joe McKenzie in Silicon Valley in 1969. After a short time as a public company in the US, it was taken private for a while, then floated on the stock market again in 1994, but with headquarters in Singapore.Flex is a leading contract manufacturer, provider of design expertise and supply chain networks for multinational and regional OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). With over 150,000 employees and an extensive network of manufacturing facilities in more than 30 countries, Flex is an integral part of the supply chain for some of the world's leading companies.

From Bad To Worse: Seagate,Apr.14.16,"Last night Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) preannounced its fiscal third quarter results. They were, in a word, awful. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $2.6B versus guidance of $2.7B. The $2.7B is down from previous street expectations of $2.8B just 90 days ago. $2.6B in Q3 revenues represent a 21.9% decline on a year-over-year basis, which is an acceleration from the Q2 decline of 19.2%. Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 23% versus guidance for 25.6% and previous margin of 24.8%. Total drives sold fell to 39M units, down a whopping 15% from the previous quarter. The total addressable market or TAM for HDDs is declining at an alarming rate. Shares are crashing so far this morning, down 18% at the moment.What's Happening?Seagate is experiencing weakness across its product portfolio. In the press release, it cited reduced demand for mission critical HDD enterprise products, storage arrays, SSDs and client desktop and notebook drives. We knew client would be weak, but the weakness in mission critical enterprise drives is particularly concerning for the bulls as enterprise is always what they point to as the savior for the company. The fact of the matter is that SSDs are coming for the enterprise business quicker than most expected. When storage array makers EMC (EMC), NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) report later this earnings season, I expect them to report large increases in all-flash arrays (70-100%) and modest declines in traditional HDD storage arrays as this has been the pattern in recent quarters. Also concerning for the bulls was the weakness the company pointed to in its silicon products, aka SSDs. As I have stated before, competition in enterprise SSDs is intense, and without its own silicon Seagate is at a pricing disadvantage. Anyone thinking SSDs will save Seagate will likely end up being sorely disappointed."
THE LIMITATIONS OF FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:,"Mar. 22, 2016 3:50 AM ET","Look at HP, the new Hewlett Packard entity. It is giving a new BUY SIGNAL.Here is the first of an exchange that I will be developing and expanding. It is in response to a post in which I challenged readers to spend less time studying obscure numbers presented and mispresented by companies whose goal was largely subterfuge (annual reports) and learn to develop a new way of seeing, developing their right brains and their ability to see visually.One reader responded: ""Yeah, why waste time analyzing numbers, when you can squint at squiggly lines and just ""see"" the future! Voodoo trumps analysis every time!""Here is my response to him:Actually, all those 'squiggly lines' are also numbers. The question is: do you want to analyze numbers that interpret stock market action directly or numbers that analyze a business but do not directly analyze the stock market?Business fundamentals DO analyze the business; but they do not analyze the stock market. There is no direct causal connection between a stock's fundamental progress and the behavior of that company's stock.Think about that. I will write it again: THERE IS NO DIRECT CAUSAL CONNECTION BETWEEN A STOCK'S FUNDAMENTAL PROGRESS AND THE BEHAVIOR OF THAT COMPANY'S STOCK. Companies with growing earnings or with superior cash flow (whichever yardstick you like to use) TEND to have appreciating stocks. But this is not a law -- it is a tendency. Some stocks rally; some stocks sink, even with growing earnings or any kind of fundamental 'progress'. You are betting on tendencies, but not on real numerical descriptons of stock market behaviors.My numbers analyze stock market behaviors directly. You see, fundamental analysis is the voodoo science. Because a company's fundamentals and its stock price are not connected causally. Investor's bet tendencies only, assuming and defending a causal connection that is not there. A company with bad earnings might go through the roof because of a take-over bid -- but fundamentals will show only a floundering company. They will never predict take-over movement.But my numbers (those 'squiggly lines' you laugh at) will show accumulation of shares, whatever the fundamentals show.My voodoo analysis describes and investigates stock performance; the essential understanding is that stock performance includes or reflects everything known or thought -- rumors too -- about the company. And also emotions of investors, either in accumulation or in distribution.Markets are not rational. Understanding everything rational about the company will not guarantee one success -- BECAUSE markets are not simply rational adding machines. Markets are emotional also.My voodoo numbers (and the squiggly lines they generate) include the emotional and the fundamental data, inherently, because the stock price reacts to both the fundamental data (Known and anticipated) and the emotional reaction of investors.So, which numbers are really a form of voodoo -- those numbers which analyze a stock's performance or those numbers which only analyze a business and make secondary assumptions about what this will mean to the company stock?The second is one major step removed from the business of stock market performance, ASSUMING a strong business will always or at least generally result in stock gains. But what about those times it does not?But WHEN will this company's stock respond to underlying fundamental strength? Your fundamental analysis excludes timing issues. A strong company can sit in a trading range for 3 years before it moves. And then when do you sell? What fundamental data tells an investor when to sell -- and does it do this before or after the market has already taken the lead to the downside?Any knowledge that excludes 'timing' or provides no provision for the timing of trades is an incomplete knowledge, or religious dogma, at best.MJC, CGTSDisclosure: I am/we are long HPQ."
Why Microsoft Needs Intel's Smartphone Processors,Apr.15.16,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) needs to revise its phone strategy. With less than 3% global smartphone share, the partnership with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is not working out. It is time for Microsoft to build premium Windows phones with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) processors. A flagship $600 Surface phone with an Intel Atom x5 or Core M processor is highly desirable.An Intel-flavored handset might improve the stale state of Windows phones. Allowing third-party phone vendors to use any processor may also increase industry support for WM10 devices. Aside from fringe player Acer and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), there are no other major firms that will support high-end Windows 10 phones.Third-party manufacturers might favor Windows 10 phones if the Continuum for Phones concept is fully implemented. Continuum's ambitious proposal is that high-end W10M phones could be used as portable computers. This is a killer idea that certainly appeals to enterprise users.Unfortunately, all Windows 10 Mobile phones are still exclusively equipped with ARM-based processors from Qualcomm. They are limited to running watered-down versions of mobile-centric apps (like Office 365) when connected to external displays. Even the Lumia 950 XL and Hewlett-Packard's Elite x3 are incompatible with legacy desktop software like AutoCAD or Photoshop.A Qualcomm-powered WM10 phone is not yet a replacement for the office laptop. Only an x86 processor can turn Windows 10 phones into real pocket computers. Workplace (and on-the-go) productivity requires people to often use legacy Windows productivity software.Due to the many differences between x86 CICS vs. RISC processor architectures, ARM-based processors are (and will never be) fully compatible with legacy Win32/.NET programs."
How One Advisor Provides Downside Protection To His Clients,"Mar. 15, 2016 7:42 AM ET","In this interview, conducted via email, we discuss some unique aspects of the practice of Robert Wyrick (pictured below), a registered investment advisor in Houston.David Pinsen: Thanks for taking the time to tell us about your practice, Rob. You run Post Oak Private Wealth Advisors, one of the leading investment advisory firms in Texas, with roots going back to 1993, and you specialize in advising employees and retirees of some of the largest corporations in the country, including Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) (NYSE:RDS.B), Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI), Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX). In addition, you also serve entrepreneurs and medical professionals. How did you go about building this client base?Robert Wyrick: Thank you David. We really have built our practice one client at a time and largely through clients recommending us to their colleagues. In the early days, we primarily worked with Exxon employees, but over the years, our practice has expanded to employees of many of the companies mentioned above. Many of the clients we advise are knowledgeable and have done an excellent job preparing for retirement, but as they approach the distribution phase of their investing cycle, they have greater concerns about market volatility and the impact losses can have on their long-term income proposition. Managing downside volatility, and incorporating this thinking into a distribution plan is our area of expertise."
OpenStack Cloud Is The Telecommunications Mainstream,Apr.27.16,"Because the big telcos have finally bitten the cloud bullet, their industry, and tech generally, has been primed for its next recovery.At the OpenStack Summit in Austin this week, the message from AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) was clear. The phone network as we knew it is dead. It has been replaced by a cloud fabric linking data centers with client devices.A few of the old data center suppliers seem to have survived the transition. Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), which supplied old-style data centers a decade ago, are still players today, thanks to the telcos. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) remains a primary supplier as well. But the companies that once supplied high-end switching gear that distinguished between ""telco"" and ""computer networking"" markets, companies like Nokia (NYSE:NOK) unit Alcatel-Lucent, and Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), are having to find niches.The carrier wins are also big for Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), the open source software company, which over the last few years seemed to be watching Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) run away with the cloud market based on proprietary ""public cloud"" technology, as the ""hybrid"" cloud market it hoped to prosper on was slow to develop. The carrier commitment gave Red Hat a firm base, and the mainstream of corporate technology is now firmly in OpenStack's corner.Meanwhile, last-mile gigabit networks continue to snake their way into a few lucky markets, further centralizing tech-related industries among a few major centers. On my own street in Atlanta, where 20 years ago BellSouth had a single unshielded wire running on the phone poles, this year I have seen two fiber runs laid. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) joined Verizon Wireless to run fiber under the sidewalk. AT&T is running fiber along phone poles. The neighbors are all excited about sightings of Google, which also plans an overbuild. Cities without such gigabit-speed connections could be left by the wayside over the next few years, as could suburbs within those cities."
Banks/Funders Pony Up Another $2.5 Million Plus In Sheldon Player' EAR Settlements,"Jan. 13, 2016 12:10 PM ET","by Tom McCurninLeasing News Legal EditorEquipment Lessors Pay Massive Amount of Money to Rid Themselves of the EAR Preference Claims. The Trustee is a Huge Winner.I have been following this, writing about this for Leasing News since 2012, but I must admit I never thought too much about the EAR Trustee suing the leasing companies for fraudulent conveyance. I assumed the cases would just go away -- or would settle early for very nominal amounts. Boy, was I wrong! This is both a major loss and a major precedent!In the last six months, the ""who's who"" of major leasing companies ponied up $2.5 million dollars to the bankruptcy court just rid themselves of this nasty litigation brought on by poor underwriting and filing ""abundance of caution"" proofs of claim. This does not count attorney fees, court costs, or bank officer's time or travel involved in the cases.It also does not include the payments not made to the funders or lessors by EAR, or the loss of collateral that was valueless or did not exist, or the court costs, fees, attorney costs, bankers time, in the collection effort by the bank and/or lessor.These are amounts paid so far to dismiss the case, all from the Northern District of Illinois Bankruptcy Court. Read it and weep.LessorCase No.Amount PaidAmerican Bank11-02200$90,000CIT Group11-02203$440,000Comerica11-02218$100,000Hewlett Packard Financial Services.11-02220$750,000KLC Financial11-02222$150,000Leasing Innovations11-02102$1,750Leasing One11-02224$300,000Pentech11-02231$25,000Peoples Capital11-02233$130,000Plains Capital Leasing11-02236$425,000SunTrust Leasing11-02201$137,500In addition, US Bank and IBM Credit appear on the verge of settling with the Trustee. I say that because the trial is in a few weeks, and I've seen no briefs, witness lists, or other documents, which to me means they are talking settlement. Those two ought to be very big settlements as well.A few other leasing companies were dismissed because they were out of business, or were bank subsidiaries and the FDIC took over the bank.In addition, two cohorts of Sheldon Player, Mark Anstett (president and co-owner of Equipment Acquisition) and George Ferguson (owner and president of the former Machine Tools Direct, the vendor involved) were indicted by the Grand Jury for wire fraud. Anstett plead guilty in Case No. 14 CR 102-1 (E.D. Illinois) and received five years in prison. He is due to surrender this week. Ferguson appears to be pleading guilty as there is a change of plea hearing set for later this month. Both men are in their 50s and 60s and their prospects look very bleak indeed.For those of you who don't remember this huge leasing fraud, some background might be useful.The ScamEquipment Acquisition Resources acquired equipment and double, triple and quadrupled the financing of the equipment through a couple dozen leasing companies. Its principal was Sheldon Player. Often the equipment did not exist. The ticket prices were six figure deals, so at least in my leasing background, this would warrant a background check of the vendors and principals, lessees and their principals, and of course a surprise, unannounced physical inspection of the equipment.Apparently, no one bothered to inspect the equipment or to adequately underwrite Player. And let me emphasize this point that Leasing News wrote about Player and his background in an alert May 2, 2007, including later an interview with Player, published May 4, 2007, which included why he was turned by several leasing companies. (1) Sheesh, did none of the leasing companies read Leasing News or have a computer and ""Google?"" I mean really, I don't get it.The EAR leasing companies were not rinky dinky strip mall brokers, these were major players. Being a convicted felon, he wouldn't be able to work for any of the banks or bank subsidiaries by federal law, but they fund him $150 millions? Someone really needs to explain to me how this happened. I know there were several who discovered the discrepancies and did not go ahead with the lease, as that was the way Leasing News learned about it and searched who Player was and his fraud conviction case with Greyhound Leasing for doing the same he was doing at EAR.In any event, Player successfully operated the scam as a Ponzi scheme with new leasing company financing paying off old leasing company financing Old, paid off leasing companies thought the deal was so good, that they often came back for more, and did multiple financing. Most of the lessors had multiple deals in the aggregate of seven figures.As all Ponzi schemes go, the scam crashed on October 23, 2009, when EAR filed for bankruptcy. (2) Player, died November 13, 2013 of prostate cancer. (3).The TrusteeThe court appointed an experience trustee to manage this massive bankruptcy, trustee William Brandt. Brandt is a lawyer and accountant and is widely recognized as one of the foremost practitioners in the insolvency field. He is well connected politically, having served on the Illinois Gubernatorial Transition Team and the Presidential National Finance Board. To call him a heavyweight is probably understating his qualifications. He is known and respected by anyone in the bankruptcy field, is a frequent speaker, and is known as a very aggressive litigator.The Trustee's LawsuitsBrandt filed about three dozen lawsuits within the bankruptcy, called adversary actions against every creditor of EAR who had received any money from EAR pre-bankruptcy. This included, by the way, The Internal Revenue Service. And won! Yeah, this guy takes no prisoners.The suits in general alleged a fraudulent conveyance of EAR money, alleging that by virtue of their financing, they contributed to the loss and downfall of EAR. Moreover, Brandt alleged, that without the financing, EAR would have cratered sooner.The Trustee concluded that EAR was a Ponzi scheme, by concluding that the ""investors"" were the creditors of EAR which supplied EAR with money and goods and expected payment in return. While characterizing EAR as a Ponzi scheme might be a bit of a stretch, such a characterization has an advantage in that there are special rules for Ponzi schemes and fraudulent conveyance actions, because the investors really don't have specific intent to defraud anyone, they are just ignorant investors. Accordingly, a body of law has developed which presumes intent if the Ponzi scheme is established. Thus, the Trustee could, if a Ponzi scheme was proven, go after the investors for the monies received during the scam, seeking to recover the monies paid to the equipment lessors.Many of the smaller players settled with the Trustee, but eleven brave lessors stood tall and fought the Trustee-for four years and three sets of pleadings.The case had a number of procedural twists and turns. As reported last year in Leasing News, the lessors filed motions to dismiss, which were granted, but gave the Trustee leave to amend. When the Trustee amended his Complaint, Brandt again alleged that EAR was a Ponzi scheme and did not allege specific intent on the part of the equipment lessors. The lessors file a second round of motions to dismiss. (4)After several continuances, the Court reached a ruling in June, 2014 which again granted the motion to dismiss and again gave the Trustee leave to amend, but with one very big development-the Court ruled that EAR was not a Ponzi scheme, and as a result, the Trustee had to allege specific intent on the part of the lessors.Brandt amended and alleged fraud with specificity against the equipment lessors and the pleadings stuck in 2014.Several of the leasing companies (CIT Group, Plains Capital) tried to get the United States District Court interested in an interlocutory (discretionary) appeal of this travesty, but to no avail.The Trustee scheduled no less than ten (10) depositions of Suntrust, TD Bank North Leasing, Leasing One, The CIT Group, together with Mark Anstett (president and co-owner of Equipment Acquisition) and George Ferguson (owner and president of the former Machine Tools Direct). The lessors scheduled a score of depositions of the trustee and other players (no pun intended).The Legal FeesLitigation is expensive. Every one of these motions to dismiss involves research, a pleading, reviewing an opposition, drafting a reply, and attending a hearing, or two. While I obviously do not know how much the lessors spent, I would have to guess that each one of the three motions ran $25-30,000. Add to that numerous status conferences and a very large discovery dispute over documents, and each lessor could have easily incurred $100,000 in fees. And this is sunken money-the lessors are never going to get it back, even if they win. And the prospect of 15 depositions all over the United States? These depositions could easily add another $100,000 in fees. And, we haven't started talking about having a trial on the merits. Taken all the way, this could have been a $400,000 problem.Brandt typically did not have those attorney fees. Trustees usually strike a deal with their counsel on a percentage or contingency basis, so there is no cost to the estate for continuing the litigation, year after year. To add insult to the situation, typically the lawyers and trustee hold out for big money and settle with bigger players for a lot of money, and throw the low hanging fruit away.The SettlementsOnce a reader understand the economics of this type of litigation, the reader would quickly come to the realization that perhaps Brandt wasn't giving up, and the legal sink hole will only get deeper and deeper. So perhaps, the wiser course is to offer the trustee some money. I think I would have gotten to that conclusion earlier than later, but frankly, it's never too late to settle.So, for the past eight months, the individual lessors worked amongst counsel and structured settlements. It was hard for me to figure out why some lessors paid more, but generally the amount of leases they had (and the corresponding amount of EAR money they received) seemed to be a factor along with whether or not the lessor filed a claim. I'll get to why filing a claim might have been an issue later.So at this juncture, eleven of the lessors have settled and two more appear to be on the cusp of settling with Brandt. What a painful lesson this has been.How This Could Have Been AvoidedOf course, underwriting is the answer here. The lessors could have underwritten the vendor, which was EAR and Player, and could have made him qualify from a credit standpoint just like any other customer of the lessor. I remain puzzled why EAR and Player got such special treatment by the lessors.Funding protocols is another answer. I was taught that lessors never, ever, fund without pre-approving the vendor and physically inspecting the equipment. Now a $10,000 computer system may not deserve the attention that a $100,000 piece of equipment will, but nevertheless, some funding protocols are necessary. I again remain mystified how this could have happened, especially with the alert and stories in Leasing News.Filing a claim was also an issue. Back in about 2004, the United States Supreme Court ruled on a relatively benign issue involving the estate of Anna Nicole Smith, the Guess Jeans super model turned whacko reality star. The case, Stern v. Marshall, essentially held that fraudulent conveyance actions may not be ""core"" proceedings, and thus, the trustee might not be able to sue for such claims within the bankruptcy and the district where the matter is pending. A pile of other more direct cases held that this was the case, but could be waived by a creditor filing a proof of claim, which essentially deems the creditor has consented to jurisdiction where the bankruptcy is pending.Most of the lessors did file such claims, and thus implicitly consented to Brandt's suit against them, even if they were not located in Illinois. While some of the lawyers filed motions to drop the bankruptcy adversary case (often called a motion to remove a reference), it was too late for the lessors who had filed their claims. They were stuck in Illinois and stuck with William Brandt.TakeawaysThere a bunch of lessons here, many of which I've probably already gone over, but here is the short list:First, Look more closely at who referred the deal to you. After this was brought to light, there were five or more brokers who knew what was going on, including one who actually placed several of the same equipment to various funders, and received a commission from EAR for doing so.Second, Underwrite the Vendor. Most lease fraud cannot occur without a crooked vendor (fake equipment, kickbacks, over-priced equipment), so figuring out what this equipment is and who is selling it and if they have been in business for a significant period of time is important. Player's resume had three year gap in it while he was in prisonThird, Underwrite the Deal. Underwrite the lessee. Any deal over a self-proscribed threshold, say $75,000, a background check or public records search is warranted.Fourth, Observe Funding Protocols. No funding check should leave without the equipment being visually inspected by a third party inspector. There were very few, if any site inspections or follow-up inspections during the course of the lease.Fifth, Use Common Sense. At American Express, we had a bunch of deals go bad where people in one state were financing equipment from a vendor 300 miles away. Made no sense. At Leaf, we had a chiropractor who financed 50 copier machines for a single location. Made no sense. So the lease administers needs to exercise common sense.Sixth, Think Before Filing a Proof of Claim. Creditors instinctively want to file a proof of claim in every bankruptcy they see, whether it is a no asset or the prospects for collection seem poor. My advice is to stop, think, and get good counsel to help decide whether filing that claim makes sense. In EAR's situation, everyone who read Leasing News knew this was a Ponzi scheme in 2007 and this jailbird and this estate was going down. Everyone knew that there were a bunch of big name lessors involved which make this type of litigation very attractive. This is not to say that a lessor never files a proof of claim, but some thought process has to go into the decision.Seventh, Settle Early, Settle Often. From experience, I will tell you that the first people who settle in Ponzi schemes get the best deals, because it fills up the trustee's coffers and allows him to pursue bigger, fatter targets. I was very surprised that the lessors allowed this litigation to go on for four years.The bottom line to this case, and the settlements is this-although late in coming, the lessors probably made a smart move in disposing of this litigation, albeit at a very costly sum. Next time, underwrite.(1) Sheldon Player, Greyhound Leasing, Deja vu?http://www.leasingnews.org/archives/May%202007/05-04-07.htm#deja(2) Bankruptcy Filinghttp://leasingnews.org/PDF/EAR_Files_BK_11.pdf(3) Player Death Recordhttp://leasingnews.org/archives/Jan2014/1_23.htm#confirmed(4) Lessors Chastised by District Court In E.A.R.

Flextronics: Strong Growth Projected To 2020,May.16.16,"I have been following Flextronics (NASDAQ:FLEX) since before the Solectron merger in October 2007. I thought it was interesting that this is the company that makes products well-known companies like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) (NYSE:HPE) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) use, but is largely invisible to most consumers and investors. The Solectron merger increased FLEX's revenue and eliminated a competitor, but was done before the financial turmoil in 2008 which hammered the FLEX stock price weakened its end markets.During the 2008 stock market meltdown the FLEX share price dropped from $12 to $8 to $4 and ultimately bottomed out at $1.23 in late 2008. In early 2009 they hit a low of $1.81 and then rose strongly as the year progressed. The sharp drop in the stock price was very shocking for me as an investor and was not justified by the fundamentals of the company. However there was much greater scrutiny of each company's financial position and their ability to repay debt.During fiscal 2009 FLEX wrote off the entire $5.9 billion in goodwill off of the balance sheet. It was a bold move because shareholder equity also was reduced by $5.9 billion. Shareholder equity was reduced from $8.24 billion at year-end 2008 to $1.86 billion at year-end 2009. By fiscal 2010 debt had been reduced to around $2 billion and their financial stability was no longer in doubt. In fiscal 2010 FLEX revenues bottomed around $24 billion and profits were reduced by various restructuring charges.Revenues rose back to $29 billion in fiscal 2011 as strong organic growth resulted in roughly 20% revenue growth and much improved profitability. Net Income was $596 million which translated to 75 cents per diluted share (on 790 million shares outstanding). Since fiscal 2011 revenues have continued to be up and down without showing sustained increases over time. However FLEX has been able to drive operating margins higher and has continuously added new capabilities to capture new business."

Proofpoint: A Short Idea For 2016,Feb. 1.16,"Founded in 2002, Proofpoint (PFPT) is a security-as-a-service vendor that delivers data protection solutions. Its main product focuses on e-mail with its solution protecting clients from malware, virus, spam, phishing and similar and associated security issues and problems for corporate e-mail systems. In 2011, the company was certified by FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act) and so can also serve U.S. federal agencies.Considering its small size, the company has an impressive clientele with 49% of the Fortune 100, as shown below:(Source: Company)Gartner has positioned Proofpoint as a market leader in secured e-mail gateways and enterprise information archiving as shown below:(Source: Gartner)Despite having such large corporate clients and holding a leadership position within the industry, the company is loss-making. Actually, since its founding, 14 years ago, the company has never been profitable. Some investors like to use Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as an example of a company that was loss-making for years and still struggles with profit yet has returned an amazing stock performance. Amazon was founded in 1994, and by 2008 (14 years later), the company had $19 billion in revenues. PFPT in 14 years has grown revenue to $0.3 billion. So obviously Amazon is a poor comparison. In addition, in 2008, AMZN's market cap was $30 billion for a price to sales of 1.6x. PFPT's market cap is $2 billion for a price to sales of 7.5x. So despite the much lower growth, Proofpoint is trading at a much higher multiple. (FYI, for readers who may consider that 2008 was a bad year to choose, AMZN's 2007 market cap was even lower - see here)."
Now Is A Suitable Moment For A Long-Term Purchase Of 3D Systems' Shares,May.23.16,"3D Systems Corp.'s (NYSE:DDD) Q1 2016 revenues decreased by 16.8% to $152.6M compared to Q4 2015, due to the departure of the corporation from the consumer segment of the additive manufacturing market. At the moment, it is difficult to estimate the number of potentially lost customers, but it is projected that sales of consumer 3D printers will grow rapidly in the near future:(Source: Gartner)Irrespective of the correctness of this decision, the corporation will not receive much harm because of it, apart from a small forgone profit in the consumer segment, of the company's total revenues.(Source: 3Dsystems)On the other hand, a focus on the industrial segment will bring benefit in the form of a lower cost of sales.

Despite rallying on high volume after reporting solid results in Q4, Rackspace is currently trading at the $20s level, which marks a support level created during 2010. In no other time period Rackspace traded at such a low prices, which means that RAX is trading at five-year lows.

Prospective bidders include financial buyers such as Advent, Vista, TPG, and KKR (NYSE:KKR) as well as strategic buyers such as AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA). The incumbent management had been running a sham process in order to look like it was doing something for shareholders while avoiding an actual sale. However, with the arrival of Starboard's proxy battle, this may turn into a real strategic review. If MSFT succeeds, it will cost the company a small fraction of the $45 billion that Steve Ballmer tried to shell out for Yahoo! in 2008. PE firms are looking to pay around $6 billion for core Yahoo! while the incumbent management has been holding out for $10 billion.

Consider Breitburn Energy Partners Bonds,May.27.16,"After one and a half years of low oil prices, the much anticipated wave of energy bankruptcies has arrived. Cut off from credit markets, unable to raise more equity, and out of options, many of the smaller, highly leveraged E&P companies have no choice but to fold. While shareholders in bankrupt companies will almost certainly get wiped out, value remains for those willing to invest higher up in the capital structure. By taking a look at some of the companies that have bonds available to trade on the open market, we can estimate the net present value of the enterprise and the bonds. To determine intrinsic value, this article will discuss the following topics: NPV assumptions, data tables, and insider transactions. Companies studied in this article include Breitburn Energy Partners (NASDAQ:BBEP), Linn Energy (NASDAQ:LINE) and Halcon Resources (NYSE:HK).CalculationsIt is impossible to estimate the net present value of an upstream oil company without making assumptions on future oil prices, company decline rates and cost of goods sold. Assumptions made for these calculations include operational, administrative and capex expenditures similar to Q1 2016, 10% annual production decline (consistent with management guidance in Q1 2016), 5% annual net cost decline (consistent with operational expenses as a ratio to total company expenses), higher lien debt paid in full, and hedges liquidated to pay down higher lien debt.

Hewlett-Packard And 3D Printing: The Road To Redemption,Sep.28.16,"IntroductionHP (NYSE:HPQ) presents an interesting investment thesis. It has the combination of a modest PE ~8, a reliable dividend at more than 3% and an interesting suite of businesses which are being managed aggressively with an eye to growth. I recently initiated a small position in the stock which I hope to grow on market pullbacks into a core position as its initiatives gain traction over time.HP's path to this point has traveled an unusually serpentine route. Its future is tied to 3D Printing which has also forged a sinuous path.3D Printing is an industry with a checkered past and a promising future.Just as the House of the Rising Son has been the ruin of many a young man, so has the allure of 3D printing's growth and profit served as the ruin for many investors' portfolios. The lead paragraph to a February 2015 Barron's follow-up article tells the story:A year ago, 3-D printing companies were poised to rebuild the world. Today, their stocks have been flattened. Much of the losses have come in the wake of Barron's cover story, which warned about the frenzy forming in the 3-D space (""Beware 3-D Printing!"" March 10, 2014).In 2013, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) stock was trading in the $90s. It fell all the way to the high single digits toward the end of 2015. It has since partially recovered and its price at close on September 23, 2016, was $16.40.Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), the other publicly traded 3D printing company giant by 3D printing standards, traded above $130 in early 2014. It backed down to the mid teens in January 2016, recovering into the $20s. Stratasys' price at close on September 23, 2016 was $22.03.So what was it that caused 3D and Stratasys to fall so far and so quickly? No doubt there were many contributing factors. One that seems to always come to the fore is that the industry was over-hyped and got ahead of itself. According to the above referenced Barron's article:"
Hewlett Packard Enterprise: You Must Remember This,Sep.10.16,"HPE-As time goes by!Another month, another couple of transactions. To some Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) shareholders it probably seems that way. The well rumored sale of HPE's enterprise software group was announced the other evening (September 7, 2016). The initial reaction of the market was mixed at best and the shares were downgraded by Wells Fargo, primarily it appears because the deals that have been announced will not be completed in the next several months. Other brokerages reiterated their ratings and their price targets. I can't deny that the closing dates for the two transactions in question are several months in the future. And evaluating HPE as an operating company over that time span doesn't really make that much sense. Today, investors ""must remember this,"" that evaluating the value of HPE requires valuing three disparate assets and adjusting for a very significant cash balance that, depending on certain assumptions, represents more than 40% of the company's current share price.I wrote an article a few days ago that perhaps foreshadowed the topics I'm going to take up in this piece. It would have been simpler by far had HPE found a buyer that might reward shareholders with some significant cash payment - but it didn't wind up that way although it might have wound up better in the end for HPE shareholders."
"Eye On Tech: HP Enterprise Wins Over Dropbox, And Amazon Commits Another $3B To India",Jun. 8.16,"Good morning, and welcome to the June 8 edition of Seeking Alpha's Eye on Tech newsletter.HP Enterprise lands a major hardware deal with cloud storage giant Dropbox - Three months ago, Dropbox (DROPB) disclosed it has largely migrated from Amazon's popular S3 cloud storage service to an internal solution relying on (per an in-depth Wired column) ""a new breed of machines designed by its own engineers, all orchestrated by a software system built by its own programmers with a brand new programming language"" (not something a typical AWS client can do). The company has now disclosed its infrastructure relies on modified HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) servers. In return, HPE has become a Dropbox customer and has agreed to resell Dropbox's services.HPE's high-density Cloudline serversHPE is coming off an April quarter in which its server revenue rose a stronger-than-expected 7% Y/Y, and - with the help of partnerships with Asian contract manufacturers - has tried to win over web/cloud service providers with the kind of cheap, dense, scale-out hardware they typically source directly from contract manufacturers. Dropbox acts as a valuable reference win for those efforts, even if the deal may have come at a price - the WSJ notes ""both companies agreed Dropbox drove a hard bargain."" Meg Whitman, for her part, insists the deal is profitable."

5 Top Large-Cap Stocks For Greenblatt's Magic Formula,"Jun. 8, 2016 6:18 AM ET","In this edition of Watch List Wednesday, we highlight five of the top stocks qualifying for the Magic Formula screen.The screen is inspired by the investment strategy outline by Joel Greenblatt in the book The Little Book That Still Beats the Market.DescriptionThe Magic Formula® is Joel Greenblatt's successful attempt to quantify Warren Buffett's principle of buying good companies at bargain prices. This strategy equally ranks companies based on return on capital and earnings yield.By combining the top ranked stocks based on both metrics, the screen finds stocks that are highly profitable yet trading at low prices.Greenblatt defines earnings yield and return on capital in the following ways:· Earnings Yield = EBIT / Enterprise Value· Return on Capital = EBIT / (Net Property, Plant, & Equipment + Net Working Capital)The stocks are then sorted by the best combined rankings for both metrics. Here is a breakdown of five stocks with the best ratings as found on The Stock Market Blueprint:HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) - HP Inc. is a leading global provider of products, technologies, software, solutions and services to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors.

And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Let me start by saying I am pleased with the progress we made in Q3. Overall, we had a strong quarter. While revenue was down slightly on an operational basis, we saw several areas of growth in key parts of our portfolio including networking, all-flash storage, high-performance compute and technology services. Profitability was very encouraging as we continue to deliver margin improvements in enterprise services and focus on profitable deals in the enterprise group. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.49, which even before the impact of a favorable tax rate was at the high-end of our previously guided range."
HP Inc.: What Will Be The Next Surprise?,Dec. 6.16,"It can be said without much margin of error that HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) could not have been a buy-and-hold company since the dotcom bubble until today. Analyzing the 18-year weekly chart below the situation becomes quite clear. It has to be noted that after the split into two companies on November 1, 2015, Hewlett-Packard changed its name to HP Inc. and kept its ticker and stock price history.Charts courtesy of StockCharts.comNote: All charts are in semi-logarithmic scale and historical price data was adjusted to remove gaps caused by stock splits, dividends and distributions.This is not the time to talk about the several downturns that the company has gone through and the many crises it has overcome. Suffice it to say now that the company has delivered solid results in Q4 2016 and that its new strategy can work. Indeed, the company was able to gain market share worldwide in personal systems, printing and 3-D printing. With revenue growth and increased operating profit, the company is focusing on new products and innovation. Among the various new product launches and initiatives it is worth mentioning the acquisition of Samsung's printer business expected to be closed in the second half of 2017.The company returned 72% of its free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2016 and pays a quarterly dividend of $0.133 per share which represents a dividend yield of ~3.4%.Fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted net earnings per share were $1.53, above the previous guidance of $1.46 to $1.49 per share. For fiscal 2017, HP estimates that GAAP diluted net EPS will be in the range of $1.47 to $1.57. This guidance is a bit light and conservative as it's obvious that revenue and productivity will surely have an important role to play."
Top Picks Within Cyber Security,"Sep. 20, 2016 8:39 AM ET","All one need do is pay heed to headlines in order to be reminded that cyber security is an ever present challenge. Issues range from email to espionage to ransomware. Firms in the industry are competitive, and their stocks can be expensive. However, as there is a consistent need to invest in research and development, which is not guaranteed to bear fruit, the biggest tech companies have been known to make acquisitions.Here is a YChart that shows recent expenses of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), and Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), which are all involved in security solutions:So far this year, IBM's acquisitions have included two known cyber protection firms. One is Iris Analytics which utilizes a machine learning or cognitive approach to combat payment fraud. The other is Resilient Systems which specializes in incident response. In 2014, IBM bought two cloud security firms: CrossIdeas and Lighthouse Security Group.After several security purchases in 2015, Cisco has only bought out the privately-held Cloudlock this year.Hewlett Packard Enterprise, having recently split with Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HP), covers ""Everything from integrating security and protection technologies, to threat monitoring and defense, to managing security for the organization.""Juniper Networks featured security technology includes multiple firewall products. It has been relatively quiet on the merger and acquisition (M&A) front.Buyout activities comprise privately-held firms. There is no assurance that a public corporation will be a target, even if technologies appear valuable or are recognized as such. Attention is given to consider stocks of companies that are likely to be viable if they remain independent while also making sense as acquisition targets. Here is an overview, in increasing preference, of stocks worth watching:"
KIA's Conservative Options Trading Strategy,"Nov. 20, 2016 8:29 PM ET","While I do have some speculative bets like long Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), or short BlackBerry (BBRY) via puts, the bulk of my investing strategy is a system I've developed over the years, We'll call it KIA's Options Strategy.KIA's Options StrategySource: investingwithoptions.comKIA's Options Strategy is designed to deliver good returns in flat to up markets, and to return dividends in flat to down markets. The worst case scenario when making use of KIA's Options Strategy is to end up holding great companies that pay a dividend.Now don't let the notion of options trading scare you. There indeed exotic strategies involving options spreads, with crazy names like condors, calendar spreads, and strangles/straddles. But we won't be covering those here.Today I will outline a fairly simple use of options that I use daily and have been perfecting over the years.Step #1: Buy only great companies that pay a dividendThe first rule in KIA's Options Strategy is to only buy only great companies that pay a dividend. Optionally and also important is to buy companies in an industry you understand and are willing to follow.For instance, I'm a technology guy. I understand technology, I study technology, and I'm interested in for instance all the latest smartphones and computers and willing to continue following these developments. I'll use Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) for my examples.If you don't know banking and what may affect banking stocks, stay away. If however if you know all about the all the different cloud offerings, then investing there is a reasonable choice."
The Slow Death Of Hewlett Packard Enterprise,Mar. 6.17,"Stock PerformanceLast month Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) reported first-quarter results that missed revenue estimates while non-GAAP earnings came in at the high end of management's range, largely due to cost reduction programs that the company implemented. Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported year-over-year declines across all of its operating segments, which is not necessarily an indication of any execution issues, but rather the markets where HPE is playing and the lack of the company's strategic positioning in the face of a dramatically changing operating environment driven by public cloud. Management issued EPS guidance for the fiscal second quarter that was lower than we expected and also reduced its full-year guidance for fiscal 2017. The stock has had an impressive run in the last 12 months, amassing a 71% return, but the last 3 months have been tough - HPE stock underperformed the S&P 500 by 12 percentage points.Market ConditionsHowever, the reason why we're concerned is because the enterprise hardware business where HPE competes has no long-term viability. As the world moves to cloud, the demand for proprietary servers and storage continues to shrink. While the overall server and storage market may be growing by low single digits (percentage wise), most of the growth stems from hyper-scale and service providers, fueled by the tech giants: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)."
Hewlett Packard: What's Next?,Jun. 1.17,"Author's note: Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) came out with earnings and as I wrote in our Daily Index Beater service, it did not have our overall buy signal. Here is what we wrote to subscribers before earnings:The chart looks better than the fundamentals and latest analyst actions. Our overall grade looks at both the technical and the fundamentals and it is coming up with a failing grade, despite the nice looking chart and technical signals. I expect price to pull back to test support after earnings. HPE is looking for some good news from a source other than earnings.As I write this, HPE has hit a low of $17.47, down a point after earnings. So we have confirmation that we are not going to have a buy signal after this earnings report. Technically this is what we were looking for in our Daily Index Beaters article:TechnicalsThe chart is positive but not showing real upward momentum. The trends are up and it is outperforming the market. Trading near $19, HPE is at the top of the channel and it has a bad habit of revisiting the bottom of the channel near $17.The whole purpose of our write-up before earnings is to figure out where price will go after earnings. As you can see price is dropping to an expected support level.Another bearish indicator is that an analyst just dropped the target to $17 and that implies price is going lower. Here is what we wrote about the analysts before earnings:The last analyst in May downgraded the target from $21 to $18 and that is bearish. The consensus target is $21 but only 5 of 18 analysts have buys and that is also bearish.ConclusionUnless Meg comes up with something to justify her $4 million compensation, it looks like the news, other than earnings, may be a new CEO. There is a lot of turn-around talent available at that price. My guess is we will not have our overall buy signal and HPE just continues to test the downside waiting for the next announcement. Just when things look the worst, somebody pulls a rabbit out of the hat. Meanwhile we go with our buy/sell signals. I don't expect to see our overall buy signal anytime soon."
"A Year (And 35%) Later, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Is Still A Buy",Mar.30.17,"Just a little over a year ago, yours truly posted some bullish thoughts on Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE). The company's product mix was finally coming around to something more than marketable enough, and HPE shares were still mostly on the defensive following the October 2015 split with HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ).It was a premise that was met with a mild amount of resistance, with most of the concern being that Hewlett Packard Enterprise was coming to the server and cloud party too late, with too little. All the doubters had fair points.Since then, though, HPE shares have gained 35%, reaching my mental (though unspoken) target. It was a tough advance, but an advance all the same.The $64,000 question that's surfaced in the meantime: Now what?Arista Networks HelpsIn all honesty, I was prepared to suggest taking any profits on Hewlett Packard Enterprise. What was a single-digit P/E then has become a double-digit P/E now, and a trio of recent deals from HPE some say is a sign that this business-oriented half of the old HP is out of homegrown innovation ideas. The more one looks at each of the recent deals, though, the easier it is to expect another round of forward progress from the company.The first of the deals in question is its recent partnership with Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET).If the name Arista rings a bell, it may be because the young networking name is at odds with larger rival Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO). Cisco says Arista is illegally using Cisco's technology plans. Arista denies this.It's not the Cisco angle that makes Arista so noteworthy to current and would-be HPE investors, though. It's the recently expanded partnership between the two outfits. Last week, the organizations upped the ante (so to speak) to better address the telco service provider market."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise: Worth $20 And Not Much More,Jun. 1.17,"What is Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) and what does the company think it can become? These are two questions investors should seek answers to before making a long term bet on HPE stock, which are falling in the pre-market session Thursday after the tech giant posted yet another dismal earnings results.Although CEO Meg Whitman continues to exert confidence about the company's direction, it's possible she has taken this company as far as it can go. And until a new leader is installed, I don't believe HPE stock is worth more than $20 per share when projecting out to the next 12 to 18 months. Given the rate at which revenue continue to decline (13% this quarter), HPE's multiple should decline too.The stock is priced at 13 times this year's estimates and 14 times next year's, which is cheap by today's standards (S&P 500 is at 18.5). But the company is forecasting weak third quarter earnings between 24 cents and 28 cents per share versus consensus estimates of 31 cents per share. Multiply those projections by the next four to six quarters and good luck coming up with a worthwhile argument for a higher stock price.After the market close Wednesday, HPE reported adjusted earnings of 35 cents per share, which was inline with analyst expectations. Revenue of $9.9 billion came out ahead of Street's expectations for $9.64 billion. The disappointing results were blamed to a combination of higher memory costs and the ongoing impact of the loss of ""one big server customer.""As it did in the first quarter, HPE stopped short of saying who this ""major tier-1 customer"" is, but if you've read the transcripts of past two earnings reports, the explanation of this quarter's disappointment is a mirror image of what the company has previously cited. That ""major tier-1 customer"" that is impacting HPE's server business is likely Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), according to Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Faces 'Some Current Headwinds',Jun. 2.17,"Earnings per ShareHewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) reported earnings for the quarter ending April 2017 on Wednesday, May 31. CEO Meg Whitman was not able to encourage investors with a YoY decrease in Non-GAAP earnings per share (-17%) and a YoY decrease in revenues (-12%).This quarter Non-GAAP EPS of $0.35 was a inline with both the average analysts' and management estimates, a QoQ decrease (-22%) and a YoY decrease (-17%). This is below the average EPS for the prior five restructured quarters of $0.48. Since the restructuring, beginning with the QE January 2016, Non-GAAP earnings per share have now been $0.35, $0.45, $0.61, $0.49, $0.42, $0.41, in reverse chronological order. This includes both continuing and discontinued operations, net.What is the HPE Management Guidance?Estimated QE July 2017 Earnings per Share (Non-GAAP):HPE Estimate: $0.24 to $0.28Prior Year $0.49 = -51% to -43% YoYPrior Quarter $0.35 = -31% to -20% QoQEstimated FYE October 2017 Earnings per Share (Non-GAAP):HPE Estimate: $1.46 to $1.56Prior Year $1.92 = -24% to -19% YoY"
What To Make Of HPE's Net Loss,Jun. 1.17,"Hewlett Packard Enterprises (NYSE:HPE) reported second quarter results that hit estimates, despite revenues sinking by double digits. The company's results include a lot of adjustments, but shares look relatively inexpensive right now.HPE trades at $19, which is close to the company's 52 week high, and almost 50% higher than the lows we have seen over the last year.The big revenue decline (down 13% year on year) was heavily affected by the discontinuation of HPE's Enterprise Services business, adjusted for that organic revenues were up by one percent year over year -- not a very strong growth rate in comparison to many other technology companies, but not too bad either.Now when we look at the company's bottom line for the second quarter, we see a net loss of $0.37 per share -- a much bigger loss than the company had guided for (guidance saw a net loss of $0.07 to $0.03). This number, however, was also affected by one time items in a big way (as was the revenue number):When we look at the adjustments HPE makes to its net losses, we see many items that push adjusted EPS higher. Some of those seem justified, due to the fact that they are either non-recurring or non-cash costs.- Amortization of intangible assets, and loss from equity interest are non-cash charges"
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Earnings Face 'Significant Headwinds',May.28.17,"Earnings per ShareHewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) reports earnings for the quarter ending April 2017 on Wednesday, May 31, after market close. The analysts expect CEO Meg Whitman to report a dismal quarter, with a YoY decrease in non-GAAP earnings per share (-17%) and a YoY decrease in revenues (-24%). However, the HPE management outlook is much more positive with an EPS YoY average estimate of +2.4%. Management does not provide a revenue projection.The estimated non-GAAP EPS of $0.35 by analysts is a discouraging drop of -17% YoY and lower than the four-quarter earnings per share average through QE January 2017 of $0.49. The HPE management outlook is much more optimistic than the 23 analysts. Hewlett Packard Enterprise management needs to be correct this upcoming quarter to salvage financial performance.Since the restructuring and separation from HP (NYSE:HPQ), beginning with the QE January 2016, non-GAAP earnings per share have been $0.45, $0.61, $0.49, $0.42, $0.41 for the past five quarters, in reverse chronological order.Estimated QE April 2017 earnings per share (non-GAAP):Analyst estimates: $0.35 avg., $0.33 low, $0.38 high, 23 analystsPrior year $0.42 = -17% YoYPrior quarter $0.45 = -22% QoQHPE management outlook $0.41 to $0.45 = -2% to +7% YoYNon-GAAP and GAAP net earnings and earnings per share have not tracked together for the past five quarters. Non-GAAP earnings per share have averaged $0.48 for the past five quarters, GAAP EPS has averaged $0.40."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Has Upside With Multiple Near-Term Catalysts,Feb. 6.17,"A spin-off from the PC/Print business Hewlett Packard Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) itself has two spin-offs in store this year. HPE's management has decided to focus on the hardware side of the hybrid cloud (Enterprise Group) and divest both its consulting business (Enterprise Service) and its mature software business.Shares of HPE have outperformed the S&P 500 by over 20% since its inception, and there are reasons to believe the coming spin-offs can propel the stock further. A sum-of-parts analysis suggests HPE shares are undervalued by at least 20% on a conservative valuation. In a more optimistic yet still quite achievable scenario, HPE stock could be worth 66% more than the current price.HPE management agrees that its stock is still cheap and will buy back more stocks during 2017. Total return to shareholders in the forms of buybacks and dividend is expected to be about $3 billion in fiscal 2017 (about 7% of HPE's current market cap). This return commitment is on top of the $3 billion returned to shareholders in 2016. The shareholder-friendly management also has pledged to ""return significant capital to shareholders"" post spin-offs in the future.In addition, the spun out companies could further boost HPE shareholders' return. The consulting business after the spin-off will immediately merge with Computer Science Corporation (CSC), and the combined company might achieve much higher margins because of synergies. In its press regarding the merger, CSC estimates first-year synergies of $1 billion and a run rate of $1.5 billion after year 1, with possible more synergies subsequently. To put these synergy figures into perspective, the $1.5 billion number is about half of the combined company's adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year '16. If CSC's management can achieve its synergy target of $1.5 billion run rate, the forward EV/adjusted EBITDA is at about 5, a figure that is too low for this business. Even if CSC achieves only a $1 billion run rate synergy, the forward EV/adjusted EBITDA will still be a very low number of 5.5."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise - A Double Spin-Off Offering At Least 50% Upside But Likely To Be Significantly More,Mar.27.17,"IntroductionHewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) is currently undertaking a major transformation and spinning off two of its business segments, its Enterprise Services business and Software business. However, these are not ordinary spin-offs. Instead, these businesses are being spun off and then merged with a third party, which brings a number of additional benefits to both of these transactions. It feels a bit like taking a Mercedes and fitting it with a Mustang Engine whereas, in both instances, these transactions should create much stronger businesses than were they to be spun off separately.I want this to be a relatively simple article to follow. So, as a result, I have decided to focus on the valuing of each of the three companies that will emerge. I will also highlight some of the benefits from each transaction.I also want to highlight that my valuation will be based on the idea that management is hopeless (I hope this turns out not to be the case) and do not deliver on any of its proposed synergies or margin improvement.DXC TechnologyThe HPE Enterprise Services will be spun off under Everett SpinCo and merged with Computer Science Corporation (CSC) to create DXC Technology. The joint company will have sales of $26 billion. As per the proxy statement, the merged company will be a leading provider of technology consulting, outsourcing and support services for infrastructure, applications and business process domains, including strategic enterprise service offerings of cloud, security, analytics, and data management."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Earnings - Has The Company Done A U-Turn On A Trip To Nowhere?,Feb.27.17,"HPE - Is it Granada I see or only Asbury ParkThe introductory lead in is taken from a Cole Porter song titled ""At Long Last Love"" which comes from a very forgettable musical, ""You Never Know"" that dates to 1938. The song itself questions whether or not something the leading man sees is real or just a chimera. And after the quarterly results announced by Hewlett Packard Enterprise this past week, the question has arisen in the minds of many investors and analysts as to whether or not the transformation that we though had gotten under way at the end of 2015 when HPE and HPQ parted ways is going to create real value for investors or if it will be just like a vacation in Asbury Park. (Apologies to all those readers who have fond memories or still enjoy the place but… well, attitudes about the place were pretty much the same as long ago as 1938 as they are today.)While CEO Meg Whitman was emphatic during the call that the transformation process was still on track (what else might she really have said), some investors and analysts were less than convinced and the shares sold down about 7% in the wake of the earnings release. The conference call featured a couple of less than courteous exchanges - even by analysts who have buy ratings on the shares and two brokerages, BMO Capital, and Needham lowered their ratings from buy to hold and almost all analysts lowered their price targets.The shares had been outperforming the S&P over the past several months, although they had underperformed in the three months prior to this release in the wake of a prior lackluster earnings report, concerns about the spin-merger transactions I will describe later and ongoing concerns about conditions in the storage and server spaces. At the end of the day, while the quarterly results were disappointing and will certainly raise concerns about if this new business is still the ""same old HP,"" of more importance in terms of valuation are those spin mergers, the first of which is scheduled to close in a few weeks. Much of the valuation of the shares in Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) will come from the pieces of paper and the cash that investors will get when the transactions close. The quantitative support for the current share price targets is more a function of those transactions than it is a function of how well particular divisions of the company are doing now. And I think considering the value of the spin-mergers to HPE shareholders and the value of the cash on the balance sheet, the residual has been reduced to such a small level that investors can readily sample the water and buy shares. The potential for significant percentage gains from current levels has amplified in the wake of the prior underperformance of the shares and this most recent share price pullback."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Acquires Niara For Machine Learning Security Technology,Feb. 2.17,"Quick TakeHewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) has acquired machine learning security technology startup Niara for an undisclosed amount.Niara has developed machine learning technologies that can detect small changes in user behavior and other anomalies to automatically isolate and disconnect security threats internally or from external attack vectors.The deal is one of many occurring for major IT vendors like HPE as they gear up to bolster their offerings to mid-market and large enterprises transitioning to the cloud.Target CompanySunnyvale, California,-based Niara was founded in 2013 by CEO Sriram Ramachandran and VP Engineering Prasad Palkar.The company has developed a security analytics platform that applies machine learning algorithms to data from security infrastructure to better detect attacks that have bypassed an enterprise's perimeter defenses.Below is an interview video with VP Product Management Karthik Krishnan:(Source: Security Guy Radio YouTube)Niara raised $29.4 million in two rounds from top venture capital firms New Enterprise Associates, Index Ventures and Venrock, with its most recent round being a $20 million Series B closed in April 2015."

We've been marching towards becoming a smaller, nimbler and financially stronger company that is more committed to customers and partners than ever before.With this call in mind, we separated from HPI in November of 2015 and last month, we spun our enterprise services business and merged it with CSC to form DXC Technology. Completing this transaction was a major milestone in our strategy and I'm proud that we were able to execute such a significant change within the tight schedule we laid out and on budget."
HP: 6 Months Down Redemption Road,Mar. 7.17,"I last looked in on HP, Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) in September 2016 with an article titled ""Hewlett-Packard And 3D Printing: The Road To Redemption.""The article posited that HP was in need of growth drivers to carry its newly constituted persona as a standalone PC and printer company, areas where growth prospects seem slim. The article highlighted HP's then recently announced entry into 3D Printing as just the catalyst that could provide longer term growth potential for the company.Now nearly 6 months on I am checking back in to assess its further progress along redemption highway.HP's Q1, 2017 CC provides an excellent opportunity to assess the company's progress.On 2/22/17, HP clocked in with a CC slide deck and transcript. These give us an excellent update on the company as it begins its first bout of quarterly reports for its second year as a separate entity; it completed its division with Hewlett Packard Enterprises (NYSE:HPE) on 11/2/15.HP made its formal announcement that it was entering the 3D printer market on May 17, 2016. It received kudos for its proposed printer lineup. This is a complex marketplace. It will take several years in order for HP's initiative to bear fruit. In the interim HP's legacy businesses must perform well to provide it with the operating leeway to nurture its 3D printing operations.HP's core businesses are in solid shape as it works to implement its future growth strategies.HP's two familiar legacy businesses are its PC business, which it operates under the moniker ""personal systems"", and its printing business. Total Q1, 2017 revenues for the two businesses are $12,684B. Personal systems, which contributed $8,224B of its total revenues, is the big brother generating ~65% of revenues. HP's conventional 2D printing chips in with revenues of $4,483B accounting for ~35%."

Here's Why HP Inc. Is Poised To Outperform,Apr.17.17,"Following better-than-expected first quarter results in Feb'17, HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) is back with some good news for its shareholders. According to the latest data from IDC, the company has reclaimed the crown of world's top PC supplier from rival Lenovo Group (OTCPK:LNVGY). In Q1'17, worldwide PC shipments grew by 0.6% to 60.3 million units over the same period last year, helped by solid laptop shipments by HP, especially in North America. HP also witnessed a rebound in demand for PCs in Europe, with Asia-Pacific demand remaining subdued.Post separation, HP has gone from strong to very strong by removing over $1.0bn of excess costs and investing in innovation across both personal and printing systems. Such initiatives have brought investors' confidence back into the businesses (PC and printing) retained by HP, which was once declining and backed by debt. Year-to-date, personal computer vendor HP has delivered close to 22.6% returns to its shareholders, outperforming the likes of Lenovo Group and IBM (NYSE: IBM) and even the S&P 500 (as shown in the below chart).Now, let's dig a little deeper to see how HP is gearing up to improve its top line and why investors should care for it.HP has been working on product innovation, differentiation and enhanced capabilities across both personal and printing systems to drive top line growth. In the last two quarters, sales grew by 4.0% and 2.0% Y/Y, respectively, on the back of rising demand for high-end laptops and convertibles and solid performance of newly launched mobile photo and industrial 3D printers."
Billion-Dollar Unicorns: SimpliVity Exits Into The Arms Of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise,Feb.22.17,"According to IDC, the worldwide converged systems market grew 12.1% to $2.9 billion in Q2 2016. Hyperconverged sales grew 137.5% to $480.62 million or 16.2% of the converged systems market. Riding on this hypergrowth, SimpliVity (NYSEMKT:SIM) entered the Billion-Dollar Unicorn Club and was recently acquired by Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE).SimpliVity's JourneyWestborough, Massachusetts,-based SimpliVity was founded in 2009 by Doron Kempel with a mission to simplify IT, especially the modern data center. SimpliVity converges the traditional compute, storage and network switching in an x86 server form factor to provide lots of functionality in a much smaller footprint. This simplifies device management and helps customers achieve economies and ease of scale.Its flagship OmniCube platform was launched in April 2013. By mid-2015, deployments of SimpliVity's hyperconverged infrastructure totaled more than 2000, with about 550 large and mid-sized enterprise customers, nearly 380% year over year growth.At the end of 2016, SimpliVity had 750 employees worldwide and had shipped more than 4,000 systems globally since 2013.SimpliVity's business model was 100% indirect and its solutions and professional services were sold through its network of resellers and distributors. It had a reseller network of more than 1,000 partners in 73 countries, enabling the company to generate 50% of its sales outside of the Americas.SimpliVity's FinancialsSimpliVity was venture funded with total investments of $276 million from Accel Partners, Charles River Ventures, DFJ Growth, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Meritech Capital Partners, Swisscom Ventures, and Waypoint Capital. Their last round of funding for $175 million was held in March 2015 that valued them at about $1 billion."

The Fall Of HP And The Price Of Board Dysfunction,"Jan. 30, 2017 11:02 PM ET","Last year marked the continued disintegration of Hewlett Packard from the world's once-largest technology company to a struggling enterprise tech firm.Spinoffs of its software and tech-services businesses leave the company solely in the hardware business, where revenue and margin growth are a challenge.Almost uniformly, analysts see little long-term upside for either HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) or Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ). While other enterprise giants embrace cloud computing, software and services, HP essentially has worked itself out of those businesses and now remains locked in hardware-centric enterprises. With little prospect for growth, HP's only goal appears to be returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends.From its high-water mark of $125 billion in revenue in 2010, the two HP entities combined are posting revenue of $95 billion - a nearly 25 percent decline in just six years.""HPE probably will not be a long-term winner given that post-divestitures it will be a hardware company,"" UBS Research analyst Steven Milunovich recently noted. ""Industry trends favor software, services and public cloud over the on-premise business HPE addresses.''HPQ missed its numbers for most of 2016, and the secular headwinds for PCs and printers are ominous long-term. With the split, HP also has lost some of the cost efficiencies with the server business.Again, analysts generally are bearish on HPQ's long-term future.Jim Suva, senior analyst at Citi Research, recently stated: ""The market is in a secular decline mode (given limited spend toward infrastructure/devices) with some pockets of growth i.e. graphics printing, 3D printing as well as commercial mobility. However, the industry is plagued with commoditization and price competition within several players. While HP Inc.'s market share, free cash flow generation and friendly shareholder return policies are positives, increasing competitive intensity is a key risk that may result in additional revenue and margin pressures….""The negative sentiments are not new: HP has experienced very little - if any -- success since 2010, a sad testament to the once-iconic Silicon Valley pioneer.HP will make for an excellent case study on corporate leadership and the pivotal role played by the board of directors in determining the fate of a company, its employees and its customers.As former board member Tom Perkins told the New York Times: ""It's got to be the worst board in the history of business.''The board included venture capitalist Marc Andreessen; former television broadcasting executive Lucille Salhany; John Hammergren, CEO at McKesson Corp.; Lawrence Babbio, a former Verizon executive; Ken Thompson, former dismissed head of Wachovia Corp., and Robert Ryan, former finance chief at Medtronic. So how could things go so wrong for HP with such a seemingly distinguished board of directors?The roots of HP's current woes began in August 2010 when the Board of Directors forced the resignation of CEO Mark Hurd after an extensive, independent investigation into a sexual harassment claim. The board, guided by now-departed HP General Counsel Michael Holston, determined that the harassment claim was without merit, but ultimately ousted Hurd over what it said were several thousand dollars in expense account issues.In 2010, HP was at the top of its game. Market-share was growing in each of its businesses. Revenue, net income, cash flow and the share price all were rising. The company had moved into networking with the purchase of 3Com, significantly beefed up its tech services operation with the acquisition of EDS, and had acquired the remnants of Palm, whose operating system could provide efficiencies in HP's own software operations.Hurd's ouster brought immediate reaction within the technology community. HP's board already had been known for dysfunction (a proxy battle with family member Walter Hewlett and a subsequent spying investigation into board leaks created ugly headlines in the early 2000s).Most notable among the critics was Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who publicly stated that ""The HP board just made the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago.'' Ellison then doubled down and hired Hurd at Oracle in September 2010. Hurd is now Oracle CEO.That must have stirred strong emotions within HP's board because, shortly thereafter, HP brought on Ray Lane as Chairman. Lane is a former President of Oracle.Lane and HP's board hired a new CEO: Leo Apotheker, a former executive of SAP, Oracle's largest rival in the software space. ""I have known and admired Leo for almost 20 years,'' Lane said at the time. ""He is ideally suited to build on HP's strong foundation, leverage its many assets and keep the company at the forefront of innovation.''HP also jettisoned four board members and brought on five new members, including former EBay CEO Meg Whitman. The turmoil resulted in a mass exodus of HP senior management, further complicating efforts to meet revenue guidance. Among those departing were EVPs Randy Mott, Thomas Hogan and Vyomesh Joshi and SVPs Andy Mattes, Marius Haas and Bill Ianotti. Dozens of SVPs and VPs soon followed. Key HP figures such as Shane Robison, David Donatelli and Todd Bradley all left HP.On August 18, 2011, Apotheker, Lane and the HP board announced a ""company transformation.'' Little did they know at the time that the decisions would transform HP in ways that no one could have imagined. HP announced it would:Acquire Autonomy, a British software firm, for $11 billion;Explore the sale of its PC business;Discontinue WebOS, the tablet and phone operating system that Apotheker had touted as a game-changer just two months before.Even though the announcement of the Autonomy deal was lauded by directors, including venture capitalist Andreessen, HP's stock immediately fell 25 percent. The board immediately received harsh criticism that it had overpaid for Autonomy and confused its customer base with the PC plans. Coming atop deteriorating performance results, investors were distraught.Within a month, Apotheker was ousted and replaced by Whitman.The reckoning began quickly. In November 2012, HP announced an $8.8 billion write-down related to the Autonomy acquisition while claiming it was misled about Autonomy's results. That followed an $8-billion write-off tied to HP's botched integration of EDS, the tech services giant it acquired in 2008. Whitman then fired Holston, the general counsel.Whitman repeatedly promised a turnaround that never came. As competitors moved to mobile devices and cloud computing, HP struggled to find a viable strategy. Revenue dropped quarter by quarter. To maintain profit margins, Whitman eliminated some 85,000 jobs.Given the recent history, the performance bar had been lowered dramatically.""We haven't done anything stupid in the last four years,"" Whitman told analysts in September 2015, ""and we don't intend to do anything stupid in the future.""Perhaps nothing signified the dysfunction within HP's board more than the 2013 annual shareholder vote. HP Chairman Lane and board members Hammergren and Thompson each received less than 60 percent of the vote for reelection.HP's new interim chairman, Ralph Whitworth, announced:""Each one of our directors considered the results of our recent shareholder meeting and made the personal decision to do what they felt was best for H.P. Today's announcement is a testament to our chairman's and departing board members' statesmanship and sterling professional standards.""Unstated were these facts, as reported by the New York Times: Lane, who battled tax avoidance claims by the IRS, refused to give up the chairmanship until forced to do so by Whitman and Dodge & Cox, HP's largest shareholder. Even after he reluctantly agreed, Lane refused to leave the board. The remaining board members were unwilling to force the issue.Whitman and the HP board announced the split of the companies one year later. In 2016, HPE announced the divestment of the services and software businesses.It is notable that Lane, the architect of the Apotheker strategy, today remains on the HPE board.Projections offer no room for optimism. By 2018, the combined HP entities are expected to have combined revenue of some $70 billion - a nearly 45 percent decline from just six years earlier. Combined employment at the two companies today is 244,000, down more than 100,000 from just five years ago. (HP employed 349,600 people in 2010.)Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
Network-1 Technologies: Catalysts On The Horizon,Feb.15.17,"Network-1 CEO and Chairman Corey M. HorowitzSeveral event-driven catalysts seem to be emerging on the horizon for Network-1 Technologies Inc. (NYSEMKT:NTIP). This article will describe these possible catalysts and evaluate the merits of an investment in this microcap intellectual property firm. First, let's take a look at the fundamentals.Despite the lofty valuations of most US stocks these days, Network-1 Technologies is one company that is profitable, growing, debt free and trading at a P/E under 4. Here are some other basic metrics:Market Cap: 87.5MCash and cash equivalents: 57.8MPrice/Book: 1.7Price/Sales: 1.4Price/Cash Flow: 2.3Forward dividend yield: 2.7%Debt: 0TTM ROE: 64%Insider Ownership: 32.8%Interested?Network-1 develops, licenses and protects intellectual property assets. Put another way, Network-1 is in the business of acquiring high-quality patents on cutting edge inventions and then monetizing them by selling usage licenses. Since Network-1 owns technology patents, their licensees are often well-known tech companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). The interesting part is that historically, most or all of Network-1's licensees have been unwilling customers.This is where the ""protect"" part of the firm's mission statement comes in as a bulk of the operating expenses consist of legal consulting fees. Essentially, Network-1's CEO and Chairman, Corey M. Horowitz, has developed a consistent track record of dragging Fortune 500 tech companies into court and extracting multimillion-dollar licensing deals from them. If this business model sounds unscrupulous at first glance, consider that Network-1 actually is supporting technological innovation, which makes the world a better place, by providing inventors with a credible way to monetize their ideas.In the fiercely competitive IP industry, Network-1 isn't the biggest in terms of financial resources or staff, but unlike most of its competitors, the firm has reported a solid profit almost every quarter for the past six years. A brief overview of the competition will demonstrate just how tough the IP industry is:-RPX Corporation (NASDAQ:RPXC). Market cap: 579M. EPS has declined for four years straight mostly due to equity dilution.-Acacia Research Corporation (NASDAQ:ACTG). Market cap: 295M. About to post its fourth straight year of negative earnings.-Wi-Lan Inc. (NASDAQ:WILN). Market cap: 206M. Earnings are spotty. ROE hasn't been above 5% since 2011.-VirnetX Holdings Corp. (NYSEMKT:VHC): Market cap: 130M. Book value per share is in free fall from 1.42 per share in 2011 to .22 per share today.-Marathon Patent Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA). Market cap: 30M. Negative free cash flow every year since the 2012 IPO.To be fair, I have not done a deep dive on any of the companies listed above and some of them may be sound investments. However, after a cursory review of their financial statements, I am happy to pass on all of them.Looking at the weak fundamentals of the competition, one might be inclined to forego investing in the IP industry altogether. On the other hand, Network-1 stands out as an outlier and a consistent performer in this industry.With that overview out of the way, let's have a look at what's been happening with Network-1 lately. Over the past year, the stock has almost doubled. The 85% capital gain has coincided with two blowout quarters in both Q2 and Q3. In Q3 2016, Network-1 set all-time records in almost every operating metric and year-over-year operating income growth for the quarter was 2251%.At this point, savvy SA readers will start to wonder whether the recent performance is sustainable. No matter how impressive, past performance is only useful to the extent that it may hold clues to what the future may hold.Network-1 is a relatively easy company to understand because the firm owns four main assets with revenue generating potential. These intangible assets are portfolios of patents known as (1) Mirror Worlds, (2) Remote Power, (3) Cox, and (4) QoS. A detailed description of each of these assets can be found at Network-1's website. I will discuss each of these four assets and their monetization potential. The chart below provides a quick snapshot of what follows.AssetTotal revenue recognized(as of 30 Sep 2016)Future royalties due?Litigation Pending?Mirror Worlds~47.5MNoNoRemote Power~100MYesYesCox0NoYesQoS0NoNoMirror Worlds Patent PortfolioWhat really made Q3 2016 such a huge success was a one-time licensing settlement of 25M with Apple Inc. that was related to the Mirror Worlds patent. Under the terms of the July 2016 settlement, Apple paid 25M for permission to use one of the patents in the Mirror Worlds portfolio until the expiration of the patent.The kicker is that the patent actually expired in June 2016 so the payment was more of a penalty for past use than anything else and Network-1 will receive no future royalties relating to this settlement with Apple. This is a significant point since this 25M made up over two-thirds of the record-breaking 37M of revenue in Q3 that coincided with the big jump in Network-1's share price.The settlement with Apple was the result of litigation that Network-1 initiated in May 2013 when Apple was one of eight firms that Network-1 sued for licensing royalties. Of the remaining seven, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) settled in November 2015 for a one-time payment of 4.65M and the courts dismissed Network-1's claims against the other six firms on the basis that they were actually just customers of Microsoft.Essentially, Microsoft paid out on behalf of the other defendants. In addition, Network-1 received a lump sum payment of 17.5M in April 2016 for a professional liability settlement related to services rendered in 2008-2010 (Network-1 didn't initiate this claim but took it over when the firm acquired the Mirror Worlds portfolio in May 2013).In the end, we can see that Network-1 recognized around 30M in revenue from the Mirror Worlds litigation (4.65 from Microsoft and 25M from Apple) and another 17.5M for the liability settlement related to Mirror Worlds for a total return on investment for the Mirror Worlds patent of around 47.5M. However, no future royalties are due in connection with the Mirror Worlds patent and the firm has not disclosed any plans to initiate new litigation connected to this asset. It would seem that the Mirror Worlds portfolio has been squeezed for as much revenue as we should expect, at least for the foreseeable future.Remote Power Patent PortfolioInvestors who are familiar with Network-1 will already know that the firm's real cash cow is its Remote Power patent. With a total return of over 100M in revenue to date, this asset has been the biggest contributor to Network-1's earnings by far. 28 total firms still owe Network-1 ongoing royalty payments of around 12M-15M annually until the expiration of the patent in March 2020. Of these 28, Cisco is easily the biggest source of revenue. Cisco owes Network-1 annual payments of roughly 9M out of the total 12M-15M through the life of the patent.These royalty payments, which are payable on a monthly or quarterly basis, are the only source of locked in, recurring revenue that Network-1 can currently claim which makes modeling an earnings forecast extremely difficult. Although these recurring revenue numbers are somewhat low, even for a firm with a market cap under 100M, we can expect roughly one third of this recurring royalty revenue to translate directly into earnings. This is because Network-1 has such low operating costs with a seven-year average gross margin rate of 66.8% and a seven-year average operating margin rate of 33.1%.The firm achieves these numbers by keeping fixed and recurring costs low. Including the CEO, there are only two full-time employees. The firm leases a few small offices and since almost all the assets are either in cash or intangibles, capital expenditures are typically zero. I got a taste of this bare bones efficiency in action when I called the investor relations department recently and ended up talking directly to CEO and Chairman Corey M. Horowitz.In addition to the 12M-15M in recurring royalty revenues that we can expect from the Remote Power asset through March 2020, litigation related to this patent portfolio is still pending and investors should expect future revenue-generating settlements related to this litigation. Network-1 initiated this legislation with 16 defendant tech firms in September 2011, and as of this writing, only 12 of the 16 have settled with Network-1. Of note, the courts have consistently ruled in Network-1's favor in this litigation, so the writing is probably on the wall for the remaining four holdouts.So what can we expect from the future settlements with these firms? Perhaps the recent example of Polycom Inc. (NASDAQ:PLCM) can offer some insight. Polycom capitulated in October 2016 and agreed to pay a one-time license initiation fee of 5M for past use in addition to ongoing royalties.2M of the license initiation fee was paid within 30 days of settlement and the balance of the remaining 3M will be paid in three annual installments of 1M beginning in October 2017. In other words, the Polycom settlement did not impact Q3 since the reporting period ended on 30 Sep 2016, so we can expect roughly 2M of new settlement revenue to be recognized related to the Remote Power asset in the upcoming quarter.The remaining four firms that have yet to settle are Avaya Inc. (Private), Axis Communications Inc. (OTC:AXCTY), Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE). Estimating future payouts from these firms is difficult, but if we look at past settlements, an interesting trend emerges. There appears to be a rough correlation between the size of defendant firms and the amounts they end up paying out in licensing royalties. This makes sense when we consider that the defendant firms generate their own revenues by selling products that use the patented technology that Network-1 rightfully owns.Therefore, large firms with higher sales volumes tend to owe more in settlement royalties to Network-1 when they finally capitulate because they simply sell more of Network-1's patented technology. Therefore, we can expect that a firm like Hewlett Packard, with annual sales of around 50B, will likely be forced to pay larger settlement royalties. The trial for the four remaining firms will convene in March 2017 and it is reasonable to expect settlement payouts toward the end of 2017.Further, it is entirely possible that these firms will agree to settle before they are forced to do so and indeed a few of the original 12 defendants decided to settle prior to their trial dates. Therefore, we should expect Network-1 to recognize at least some settlement revenue in connection with the Remote Power litigation during Network-1's upcoming fiscal year.Cox Patent PortfolioThe Cox Portfolio is a wild card since to date, this asset has not generated any revenue. However, I believe this asset has untapped potential and it is actually what convinced me to buy Network-1's stock. Network-1 acquired its first patents in this portfolio in February 2013 and initiated its first litigation related to this asset in 2014. The case is progressing nicely, and in October 2016, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) ruled in favor of Network-1 against defendants Google and YouTube.The case is currently in a stay of proceedings status. If the defendants choose not to settle, I expect the case to go to trial sometime in 2018. Network-1 has already demonstrated a consistent ability to extract licensing revenues from whales such as Apple and Cisco, so a large settlement with Google seems increasingly likely. Investors who are not keen on waiting up to two years for this possible catalyst should take some comfort in the fact that Network-1 has a forward dividend yield of 2.7%, so they will at least be paid a small stipend for their patience.QoS Patent PortfolioThis relatively new patent portfolio is another wild card as it has not generated any revenue to date and Network-1 has not disclosed any intention of initiating legislation in connection with this asset.Downside RisksIn general, investing in microcaps is risky. This becomes especially true when the microcap in question operates in a fiercely competitive industry that lacks a reliable mechanism for forecasting earnings with anything resembling precision.In addition, in the case of Network-1, there are some specific risks that investors should be aware of. First, the only asset on Network-1's balance sheet that is currently generating revenue is a patent portfolio (Remote Power) that is subject to ongoing legal challenges. It is possible that the courts will determine that this patent portfolio is invalid and immediately deny Network-1 its only consistent cash flow stream.Whenever Network-1 files patent lawsuits, the defendant tech firms inevitably file counter suits seeking to completely invalidate the underlying patent in the case. This is certainly the case with both the current litigation related to the Remote Power portfolio and the Cox portfolio wherein the defendants have indeed filed counter claimsHowever, a scenario where Network-1's patents are deemed invalid seems unlikely since Remote Power has withstood legal scrutiny for over 10 years and the PTAB just ruled in Network-1's favor in the case of the Cox portfolio. Second, it is possible that Network-1 could still fail in its litigation versus the remaining four defendants in the Remote Power case. It is possible that the reason why the final four defendants including Hewlett Packard have been able to hold out since Network-1 filed suit in 2011 is because one or more of them actually has a viable defense.Third, it is possible that Network-1 will fail in its litigation versus Google and YouTube in the ongoing litigation connected to the Cox patent portfolio. Although the Cox litigation has great potential, we are still in the early phases of this case. The recent favorable PTAB ruling is a positive sign but we shouldn't expect a megacap tech company like Google to go down without a fight. If Network-1 fails to protect either its Remote Power or Cox patents in court, these events would likely create downward pressure on the stock.Finally, it is important to note that all the patents contained in Network-1's four portfolios have expiration dates and all of them will expire within approximately five years. Some will expire much sooner than that. Network-1 will need to acquire new revenue-generating patents to replace the patent portfolios currently on the balance sheet. If Network-1 fails to do this, their future profitability will be in jeopardy.ConclusionI'm cautiously optimistic regarding Network-1's ability to reach favorable settlements connected to either the Remote Power portfolio, the Cox portfolio, or both. I believe it is possible that one or more of these cases will result in a sizable settlement. Due to these possible catalysts on the horizon, I believe Network-1 investors stand a reasonable chance of achieving a satisfactory capital gain over a one to three-year holding period."
Gartner's Hybrid IT Outlook Bodes Well For These 2 Unlikely Names,"Apr. 5, 2017 2:37 PM ET","Calling a spade a spade, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have won the first round of the cloud-computing wars. Amazon Web Services did $12 billion worth of business last year, and has laid claim to roughly 40% of the market. Microsoft, through Azure, may be a distant second, but there's no ""close third"" in the race.That may be about to change, however, according to a new report from IT market research outfit Gartner. On Tuesday, Gartner posted an outlook that bodes well for mostly-cloud-irrelevant names International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE).Hybrid InfrastructureAsk ten IT people what ""hybrid infrastructure"" is, and you'll get ten unique answers. Seven of those ten responses, however, will at least look and sound similar.To the extent the question can be answered, hybrid infrastructure - sometimes called hybrid IT - is just the simultaneous use of in-house and cloud-based services to meet an organization's IT needs, which can vary from one app to the next, one utility to the next, and one database to the next.It's still a (no pun intended) cloudy description, but you get the idea... hybrid IT allows for optimization, whereas such flexibility in prior cloud computing services usually had to be custom built.The whole business has matured of late, in step with the development of new technologies and the improvement of old ones. Now, with that stage set, Gartner sees a major shift coming. That is, by the year 2020, Gartner expects 90% of organizations utilizing cloud-based services will opt for hybrid infrastructure. That shift will come at the expense of traditional data center architecture market, which is already shrinking.The dollars up for grabs aren't small either, even if they're not enormous. Spending on the young segment of hybrid cloud computing as a service is projected to swell from last year's $23.3 billion to $68.4 billion by 2020. Add in infrastructure utility services, storage, hosting and colocation demand, and the market size is expected to grow to more than $180 billion within three years, with hybrid IT overtaking the traditional data center market along the way. That's more than twice their collective market sizes right now."

What The Recent Supreme Court Decision Means For Network-1 Technologies,May.26.17,"The East District federal courtroom in Marshall, TexasOn May 22nd, the US Supreme Court delivered a long awaited decision that, at a minimum, has important implications for intellectual property companies like Network-1 Technologies Inc. (NYSEMKT:NTIP). On one hand, this event represents another setback for the intellectual property industry. Like the landmark 2013 America Invents Act, Monday's Supreme Court ruling increases the uncertainties and costs regarding the enforcement of patent rights for IP firms like Network-1. Network-1's stock responded to this decision by dropping like a brick. After hitting an intra-day high of 4.95 as recently as May 10th, Network-1's common equity closed at 4.20 on May 25th, a 15% drop in less than two weeks.However, I believe the high court's decision has not altered the bull thesis for Network-1 in the least and Mr. Market is simply showing us the moody, fearful side of his manic personality yet again. Therefore, this event presents a buying opportunity.A Closer Look at the Supreme Court DecisionNetwork-1 is in the business of acquiring and developing high-quality intellectual property assets invented by small companies and individual inventors, including world-renowned professors. Network-1 then sells the patent licenses for these assets to the large tech firms that use the technology. As you might expect, multi-billion dollar technology companies tend to be stubborn customers and these patent users typically force Network-1 to rely on the US legal system to compel them to pay to use the patents that Network-1 rightfully owns. This adversarial paradigm has forced intellectual property companies like Network-1 to seek any small advantage that they can get. One tactic that the IP companies appear to have painstakingly developed over the past few decades is the ability to select almost any district court in America to hear their cases. The mildly derogatory industry term for this practice is ""forum shopping."""
My Valuation Analysis Of HP Inc.,May. 3.17,"In this article, I am going to value the HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) based on its future cash flows. From my point of view, despite the recent growth of the share price, the company is still undervalued. I will make some critical assumptions to my valuation and therefore I will comment and justify them. Before moving to calculations, I would like to discuss the reasons for this analysis.Basics for Valuation AnalysisAccording to value approach, I am looking for good companies trading at reasonable prices. I prefer to use such metrics as Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and Earnings Yield (EY). To calculate ROIC, I use the following formula: EBIT divided by the sum of Net Working Capital and Net Fixed Assets. EY is just EBIT divided by Enterprise Value (EV). According to my calculations, HP Inc. has ROIC equals to 101.09% and EY equals to 11.4% for the last 12 month.Source: my calculations; data collected from finance.yahoo.comThe ROIC is extremely high, and the company shows a good EY. The combination of such high values is the value opportunity: the company is good, but costs cheap. Thus, the company potentially could be undervalued, and the further analysis is necessary.Free Cash Flow EstimationFirst, I need to estimate the company's free cash flow to firm. According to quarter reports for the last 4 quarters, the components of the Cash from Operations are volatile and it is extremely hard or impossible to estimate their future value precisely."
IoT Monthly Review: Investing In Hardware-As-A-Service,"Apr. 20, 2017 1:53 PM ET","March was a month highlighted by the connected car as Intel's acquisition of Mobileye for a price of 70x enterprise value to EBITDA, on a trailing twelve-month basis (TTM), reflected the high demand for technologies in this market. But more importantly, the acquisition highlights a new world of investing strategy, where a future vision of technology and ecosystems is essential for survival.The connected car is similar to many of the Internet of Things (IOT) ecosystems emerging between industries that have previously never held relationships. Traditionally, these companies were segmented by their verticals, like the semiconductor manufacturers or the analytics software providers, but the internet of things is quickly blurring those lines.The IoT is forcing horizontal integration; companies are partnering and acquiring outside their core industry, in preparation for these blurred boundaries. Intel for example, has been heavily criticized for their valuation of the semi-manufacturer, but few have realized Mobileye's potential as an edge-enabled software company, or hardware-as-a-service. In the near future, analytics and communications will be processed on silicon located at the ""edge"" of the network, as opposed to the current process occurring in the cloud, and these chips will create massive data services for vehicles. So instead of simply expanding their chip offerings, Intel has expanded their position in the value chain by acquiring the ability to create, service, and own data.This new world of enabling services from connected hardware and infrastructure requires more creative business models and industry-pioneering partnerships, but those who do not adapt to this dynamic will quickly become vertically-siloed and left for dead, with the likes of movie rentals, physical maps, and bookstores."

Tracking George Soros's Portfolio - Q1 2017 Update,"May 18, 2017 4:24 AM ET","This article is part of a series that provides an ongoing analysis of the changes made to George Soros's US stock portfolio on a quarterly basis. It is based on George Soros's regulatory 13F Form filed on 05/15/2017. Please visit our Tracking Soros Fund Management Holdings article for an idea on his investment philosophy and our previous update for the fund's moves during Q4 2016.Soros Fund Management invests globally, and the long positions in the US market reported in the 13F filings represent ~15% of the overall portfolio. The 13F portfolio value increased ~15% this quarter, from $4.32B to $4.96B. The number of positions increased from 207 to 260. Very small stock positions and large debt holdings together account for over ~43% of the 13F holdings. The US long investments are diversified, with a large number of very small equity positions, a small number of large equity positions, and a few large debt holdings. As the small positions (<0.5%) do not indicate a clear bias, the focus of this article is on the larger equity positions. The top three individual stocks held are Liberty Broadband (NASDAQ:LBRDK), Adecoagro (NYSE:AGRO), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).To learn about Soros' distinct trading style and philosophy, check out his book ""The Alchemy of Finance"" and other works.New Stakes:Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX): LRCX is a ~1.5% portfolio stake established this quarter at prices between $107 and $129, and the stock currently trades at $147.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise: A Company In Chaos,Nov.22.17,"The onslaught of bad news at HPE (NYSE: HPE) continues in full force, and this time, it seems that CEO Meg Whitman has finally given up - something the markets didn't expect, given her comments earlier this summer that she was ""fully committed"" to HPE and wasn't pursuing the top job at Uber.In an exit interview with Fortune, Whitman continued to embellish the leaner, simpler HPE that she's built since initiating the split in 2015, and she commented that ""the next CEO needs to be a deeper technologist."" Her replacement Antonio Neri, a 23-year veteran of HP and its current president, has an engineering background.Despite these comments, the unstated is fairly obvious: after two years of underperformance, it was probably time for fresh leadership at HPE. At the time of the split, HPE was supposed to be the growth machine - the idea was to separate this more attractive, software-driven, enterprise-facing company from HPQ (NYSE: HPQ), the more boring business that sells PCs and printers. The story of two HPs, however, has not played out as analysts had originally thought: in the year to date alone, HPE has underperformed HPQ by almost 50%:HPE data by YCharts"
Hewlett Packard: HP Or HPE?,Sep. 4.17,"In 2014, Hewlett Packard announced they intend to split into two separate companies - HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and Hewlett Packard Enterprises (NYSE:HPE), separating its core PC and printer businesses from its enterprise and services business.The move was viewed upon favorably by investors from the get go, allowing them to expose their investment to the company's growing data center and services industry whilst minimizing to the declining PC and Printer markets.Since its separation in 2015, the companies both have performed fairly well, with HP Inc. slightly outperforming HPE, rising 46.89% vs. HPE's 44.85%.HPE data by YChartsThe company's performance and separation is widely regarded as the right move, and although the companies stock performance is nearly identical it is yet to be seen which will outperform the other in the longer run.Sales: Have they improved?HPE has been favored by many investors who seek to distance themselves from the PC & Printer business and focus on data center and technological services innovation, but customers seem to disagree. Since the 2 companies' separation, HP Inc. has outperformed HPE's sales growth, as follows:"
Hewlett Packard Enterprise: Let The Games Begin,Sep.13.17,"It is show time now for Ms. Whitman and the folks at HPEA few months ago, having written about Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) several times, I vowed to put away my keyboard until the dust settled on all of the spin mergers. Hiving off more than half of the company to two different entities in a series of rather complex transactions (spin-mergers) and along the way making some significant mergers and selling its Chinese business as well has been no simple matter. It probably made little sense to try to value what was going to be left - until such time as the company itself established a base line. That time has now arrived, I believe.Shakespeare once wrote that “what’s past is prologue.” Of course at some level, that always must be true. But when it comes to evaluating what now remains of HPE, it is probably not the most helpful of quotations. I think it is time for investors to consider the assets that this company has and whether it can develop a solid business with some growth and more profitability and cash flow, with the residuum that Ms. Whitman has wrought.Just about a week ago, HPE reported the results of its third fiscal quarter. These result were posted in the wake of the company’s spin-merger of its software division to Micro Focus. That transaction netted HPE about $2.5 billion in cash as well as Micro Focus shares worth about $6.5 billion - a bit greater than $5/share of value."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise: In A Business Breakup Fever,Jun. 6.17,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) is continually breaking itself up after the historic split of the formal HP between its PC and enterprise businesses, with the latter making up today's HPE. We advocated for the move more than two years before the actual breakup on Nov. 2015, when at the time there was no such mentioning in the public domain, not to our knowledge.Less than a year after the HP breakup, the previously spun-off HPE has on two occasions decided to further spin off its enterprise services and software segments and merge them with, respectively, Computer Science Corporation, an IT and professional services provider, and Micro Focus, a British software company. This slims down HPE to an enterprise-computing hardware maker at the core, essentially centering around selling cloud servers, data storage and networking gears.In a sense, HPE is reversing the old HP's efforts of the past decade that sought to reinvent itself beyond traditional hardware making by acquiring a slew of software and IT services companies, including its infamous and controversial purchases of Autonomy, a British software company, and Electronic Data Systems, a then IT services giant. HP's seemingly unsuccessful software and services reinvention, featured by tens of billions of dollars in write-offs on Autonomy and EDS alone, was probably more of the result of poor executions rather than flawed strategic considerations."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Keeps Growing,Nov.19.17,"Earlier this month, the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) declared a cash dividend of $0.075 per share of common stock, which represents a 15.4% increase from the previous dividend of $0.065. This year’s income was 318M, with its EPS growing 35.5%. HPE’s performance this year, while unspectacular, was still good overall, and it is taking the right steps to continue expanding its sales and growth.(Chart taken from HPE Securities Analyst Meeting 2017)HPE’s performance in the past few years has been trending upwards, with the company steadily growing at a small but steady rate. Looking at the chart, we can see how HPE, in conjunction with DXC (NYSE:DXC) and Micro Focus (NYSE:MFGP), outpaced the S&P 500. Since November 2015 to October 2017, the total shareholder return was of 91%, while S&P 500 had a 26% return. In previous years, HPE’s return was near that of S&P's, so this seems like a clear improvement.(Taken from HPE Securities Analyst Meeting 2017)HPE is also expanding its reach and market. With new technologies emerging, it is looking to be a frontrunner in several categories. In the chart above, it's clear HPE has diversified its earnings, taking on a lot of different sectors in the information and technology sector."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise: Is Now The Best Time To Buy?,Dec.27.17,"Since the earnings announcement in November, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) has been on a consistent rise. HPE saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. Since it has been on a rise for a while, is now a good time to buy it? HPE is ranked by analysts as “hold”. Therefore, now is not the best time to buy it, but it is not a “sell”.HPE has been on a rise since the last earnings announcementHPE's 10/30/2017 actual EPS of 31 cents beat the analysts' estimate of 28 cents and also came toward the higher end of management's guidance range of 26-30 cents. This was 10.70% surprise with difference of 3 cents.Net income from continuing operations grew from 248 million to 420 million since the last quarter. Net income applicable to common shares grew from 165 to 524 million. The bottom-line performance is primarily owing to cost savings, lower tax rate, favorable other income and expense as well as transactions in connection with Software-spin merger. Meanwhile, cash flow from operations remained about the same.Poor Revenue but growing net incomeHPE reported revenues from continuing operations of $7.660 billion, up 4.6% from the year-earlier quarter's revenues of $7.324 billion. However, quarterly revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.714 billion.During the quarter, HPE's performance in the Americas stayed constant, revenues in Europe grew mid-single digit driven by higher networking and growth. Asia-Pacific witnessed strong core server sales, with growth in Japan, Australia, India and China."
Meet The New (And Improved?) Hybrid-Oriented Hewlett Packard Enterprise,Jun. 9.17,"Two months ago I penned an article about the outsized growth potential of the hybrid IT market, pegging Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) as the most-overlooked beneficiaries of the burgeoning opportunity.IBM was and still is plagued by too many problems to make it a compelling investment. Namely, its legacy businesses are losing ground faster than their next-generation lines are gaining it, and it's still unclear to most companies other than IBM what Watson is supposed to be and do.Hewlett Packard Enterprise, on the other hand, had a real shot at not just doing well with hybrid infrastructure, but thriving in it.After a closer look at the presentations and comments made by CEO Meg Whitman and the company's other technology chiefs at this week's HPE Discover 2017 conference in Las Vegas, I'm even more convince HPE is going to emerge as the leader of this paradigm shift.Hybrid What?Truth be told, it's a phrase that's not been perfectly defined, possibly bydesign. Broadly speaking though, hybrid IT is a cloud computing platform partially managed offsite, and partially managed in-house. Where speed is more important than collecting a lot of data and crunching big numbers, a company might want to manage such apps on the servers in the same building. If an application is data-intensive or needs to be available all over the world, a widespread public-cloud deployment makes more sense. A hybrid solution gives a company the option of utilizing both at the same time, finding the best of both worlds.Whitman's got a realistic view of how may and may not be interested in an HPE-provided solution too. She explained at the conference:The notion of hybrid IT is very, very relevant for small-to-medium business. Often, they don't have technology talent or the IT department inside that a big company... How do they shrink time to value for mobile apps or whatever their newest thing is? And frankly, I think hybrid IT is highly relevant to them."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise To Acquire Cloud Technology Partners,Sep. 7.17,"Quick TakeHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) has announced an agreement to acquire Cloud Technology Partners [CTP] for an undisclosed amount.CTP provides a range of consulting services to companies seeking to transition their IT functions to the cloud.HPE is right to acquire CTP for its expertise in advising and implementing information system moves to the hybrid cloud, as the once-in-a-generation shift from private to hybrid and public clouds by enterprises is well under way.Target CompanyBoston, Massachusetts-based CTP was founded in 2009 to help companies plan, build and manage IT applications and infrastructure in public or hybrid cloud environments.Management is headed by co-founder and CEO Chris Greendale and co-founder and CTO Erik Sebesta, who was previously a principal architect at Novell.Below is an overview video of CTP’s cloud orchestration system on Amazon’s AWS:(Source: Amazon Web Services)CTP’s primary offerings include:Cloud Adoption - Helping organizations plan the move to the cloudDigital Innovation - Accelerating development timelinesCloud Controls - Managed cloud operations services"
"On Second Thought, I Want To Buy The Other HP",Sep.15.17,"In March of this year I penned some bullish thoughts on Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), renewing an optimistic call I had made a little more than a year earlier. Though HPE shares were up 35% from my first look, they've gone exactly nowhere in the meantime (though they did make a couple of false starts since then).Despite the tractionless sideways movement in the meantime, I stand by my opinion voiced at the time... a handful of acquisitions and partnerships gave Hewlett Packard Enterprise some marketable technologies it simply didn't have before. While most of these newly-garnered technologies like better networking switches and hybrid cloud computing won't mean much to the average consumer, in the enterprise arena that HPE is targeting, they mean a lot. It's just going to take the company time to push these products all the way through a very slow purchase cycle.With time and reason to take note of what's changed in the meantime, however, I'm inclined to wonder if I hitched my wagon to the wrong star. That is to say, while the enterprise-scale tech market is still a compelling one, the consumer market Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) -- now referred to as HP -- is taking aim at may have become the more attractive of the two.HPQ shares are sure acting like that's the case anyway.PC Market Turning the Corner... SlowlyThe short version of a long story in case anyone reading this doesn't remember: Hewlett Packard split into two companies as of November 2nd of 2015. Hewlett Packard Enterprise took its business class customers and products, save printers, while HP was formed to deal with individual consumers, though it would still market printers (including 3D printers) to enterprise-level customers. Then-CEO Meg Whitman felt more focus would help both sides of the table, especially in light of the fact PC demand was still in the throes of a long and agonizing contraction. She took the helm of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and left Dion Weisler holding the bag as CEO of the new HP."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Gets Down To (The Enterprise Group) Business,Sep.13.17,"With the spin-offs of its Enterprise Services and Software businesses now complete, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE) will now focus on its Enterprise Group (EG) business. HPE still has its Financial Services segment, which mostly supports EG. After the spin-offs, HPE has 73,000 employees, down from 195,000.My previous article on HPE centered mostly on the Software spin-off. This article looks more closely at HPE after the spin-offs.The Enterprise Group provides customers with on-premises and cloud-based technology infrastructure and related services. This includes integrated systems of servers, storage and networking equipment, IT management software and related IT services. The sale of servers is by far HPE's largest product line, accounting for just under half of the EG's net revenues of $26.2 billion over the past 12 months. HPE competes with full service technology providers, like IBM (NYSE:IBM), Dell/EMC, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Lenovo (LVNGY), as well as product specialists, like Network Appliances, Hitachi (OTC:HICTY) and Brocade Communications (NASDAQ:BRCD), and cloud-service providers, like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). HPE competes in some segments of the market through partnerships with other technology companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (Azure) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) HANA.Over the past 10-15 years, the IT landscape has changed dramatically. Computing power and capacity has increased exponentially even as product prices have declined. The rise of mobile applications has spurred the growth of cloud-based infrastructure offerings, which has also given companies greater flexibility in meeting their evolving infrastructure capacity requirements. While technology users have maintained and expanded their own IT systems, they have also developed new applications in or offloaded some of their infrastructure capacity growth requirements to private and public clouds."

Hewlett Packard Enterprise: Cheap Stock But Tough Road Ahead,Sep. 8.17,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) reported fiscal third quarter earnings recently. The Meg Whitman led company reported better than expected earnings results posting major beats in both revenue and earnings. However, the market has not warmed up to the strong performance as the guidance again was a letdown and hardly inspires confidence. Shares of the enterprise software and hardware maker have heavily underperformed this year, partly due to the spinoffs. HPE stock is down by over 40% YTD. In comparison shares of Cisco (CSCO) and IBM (IBM) have gained more than 5% and lost more than 13%, respectively, YTD. Now, the better than expected Q3 earnings brings us to the question: Is HPE stock a good buy following the latest earnings update?HPE Q3 2017 Earnings: A Quick LookHPE reported revenue of $8.21 billion, against expectations of $7.49 billion. On the bottom line too, the company delivered an impressive beat. EPS came in at 30 cents compared to expectations of 26 cents, a beat of 15.38%. And as we had anticipated in our HPE Q3 earnings preview, the earnings beat wasn't enough to lift the stock. HPE stock price was up by over 4% in the after hours following the earnings announcement. However, the stock has fallen by more than 5% in the following days.Most of the segments showed improvement. The enterprise group delivered a revenue of $6.7 billion, a 3% year-over-year (YoY) growth. The software segment, which was recently spun off, registered $718 million in revenue, a 3% YoY decline (2% YoY decline on an adjusted basis). The financial services segment revenue came in $897 million, good for a 10% YoY growth and 11% growth on an adjusted basis. Another closely watched metric in the earnings was the server sales, as the entire server market is under pressure. Server sales were down 1% YoY but remained flat on an adjusted basis. However, storage and network revenue showed good double-digit growth. The non-GAAP operating profit margins which have been under pressure lately and a cause of concern for investors came in at 8.4%, down 150 basis points YoY but up 60 basis points sequentially."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise: Consensus Estimates Too High Given Negative Outlook,Sep.12.17,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) investors experienced a disappointing week with the stock plunging over 8% in the week ended 9/8, making it the worst performing domestic tech stock with over $10B in market cap. In my view, the biggest driver of HPE's weakness was the negative commentary given during its earnings call, which, taken together, reflects HPE's unfavorable competition position. With no evidence of headwinds abating, I see risk of consensus EPS estimates coming down for FY18 and FY19, which may pressure the stock further.Earnings AnalysisOn Tuesday, 9/5, HPE reported its FY3Q17 earnings results. In the earnings release, the CEO cited ""encouraging sign of progress"" and ""better execution"". However the market was not impressed as the stock sold off 1.9% on the first day of trading after earnings release, and continued to weaken through the week.Q3 earnings looked solid with EPS coming in at $0.31, 5 cents better than consensus. Revenue for the quarter was $8.21B vs. consensus of $7.50B. Revenue upside to consensus was broad-based with Enterprise, Software, and Finance all beating consensus estimates. The stabilization of its Server business was especially notable as its strength was somewhat unexpected. Operating margin by segment was a bit more mixed with Enterprise and Software beating estimates by 10 bps and 70 bps, respectively, while Finance missed by 110 bps.However, FY4Q17 guidance was disappointing. Q4 EPS was guided to $0.26 to $0.30, significantly below consensus of $0.40 (some estimates may include the divested Software business, which complicates the picture a bit). Management provided more forward-looking commentary during the call, which in the aggregate is fairly negative."

"HP, Inc. - The Better-Looking Twin With 3% Yield",Nov.23.17,"Both HP, Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) reported earnings, and the ongoing trend of the year continues: the dull business of selling PCs and printers at HP, Inc., originally thought to be the ""legacy"" business, has actually outperformed relative to HP Enterprise. The latter is declining in nearly all product segments and just recently announced the departure of CEO Meg Whitman, who was CEO of the combined Hewlett-Packard companies before initiating the spinoff and assuming leadership of HPE, then thought to be the ""growth"" company.A little more than a year ago, HP, Inc. looked dead in the water. PC shipments were declining, printer sales were down - and even more importantly, the paper and ink that makes the bulk of HP's profits went down with it. Now, however, the company looks poised for a fundamental comeback.As I wrote in a prior article, HP's PC business (64% on FY17 revenues; the other 36% comes from printers and supplies) has been on a rebound this year, taking the crown as #1 PC maker in April 2017. In Q3, CEO Dion Weisler notes that overall PC market returned to growth (as mentioned in HP's earnings call), and HP itself outpaced wider industry growth and gained additional share. Its market share stood at 22.5% as of Q3 (the company's fiscal Q4), up 1.2% from the prior year's Q3.And despite beating revenue estimates by a wide mile in fiscal Q4 and hitting in-line earnings targets, HP's stock sank in the aftermath:HPQ Price data by YCharts"

Antonio Neri, HPE’s President will become President and CEO and join the HP Board on February 1, 2018. I will remain a Director on HPE’s Board.

Antonio is a 22-year veteran of our company who began his HP career as a customer service engineer in the EMEA call center. He is a computer engineer by training, has a deep technology background and is passionate about our customers, partners, employees and culture. The Board unanimously agreed that Antonio should be my successor. This transition is possible because of all the work we have done during the past 6 years to transform HP. Many of you will recall the challenges the company faced when I became CEO and will recognize how far we have come."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise: Q3 Earnings Preview,Sep. 4.17,"Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) is set to report its Q3 earnings after the market close on the 5th of September. HPE shares saw an abrupt decline of 21% in the last trading session on account of the completion of a planned spin-off and merger of its software business with the UK-based Micro Focus International. The company also stated that it would issue an adjusted fiscal-year 2017 guidance at its Q3 earnings.HPE stock has still not recovered from the sell-off it witnessed in April, earlier this year. The reason for the sell-off was the lowered adjusted outlook for 2017 after the spin-off of the company's enterprise services business and merger with Computer Sciences Corp. to create DXC Technology. The stock was down by nearly 22% in the year-to-date before the completion of the latest spin-off. The updated guidance numbers after the first spin-off in March ending had sent the stock crashing. The big question ahead of the upcoming earnings announcement is: Will the upcoming earnings announcement help Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock shrug off the negative sentiment around the company? Is HPE stock at risk of a further massive slump after the earnings?HPE Q3 2017 Analyst Estimates And Management GuidanceThe current Wall Street consensus expects the Meg Whitman-led enterprise tech company to report non-GAAP earnings of 26 cents a share, down from an EPS of 49 cents in Q3 2016, a 47% YoY decline. On the top-line front, Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenue of $7.49 billion, good for a 38.6% year-over-year drop. A part of the decline in both top line and bottom line can be attributed to the spin-off of the enterprise services business. The separation costs and restructuring charges have also had an effect on the non-GAAP earnings. As per the management guidance, non-GAAP diluted net EPS in Q3 is expected to come in the range of $0.24 to $0.28, translating to YoY decline of 51.02% at the lower end and 42.85% at the higher end."

"HP Enterprise boosts dividend, buybacks in 2018 outlook","Oct. 18, 2017 7:22 PM ET","With its annual Securities Analyst Meeting today, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE +0.6%) has released its fiscal 2018 outlook.It expects EPS (non-GAAP) for 2018 to come in at $1.15-$1.25 (vs. consensus for $1.19).The board boosted its share repurchase authorization by $5B, and committed to returning $2.5B to shareholders during the fiscal year (including $2B in buybacks).It's also boosting its dividend by 15%, to $0.075/share. Free cash flow is expected around $2B, though on an as-reported basis it will be about $1B (after $200M in legacy restructuring and separation payments, $300M of payments for tax settlements, and $600M of funding for its HPE Next initiative).“Going forward, we will accelerate profitable growth through a focus on higher margin services and solutions,"" says CEO Meg Whitman. ""We will redesign our company to deliver Hybrid IT and Edge innovations tailored to our services strengths.”For fiscal 2017, it's expecting revenue growth of 5% Y/Y, and expects EPS of $1.00 as the company stands today (including Enterprise Group and Financial Services).

HP Inc. Needs To Spin-Off Printing,Nov.27.17,"Congratulations to Meg Whitman for her fine work at HP - and creating so much value for shareholders! And kudos for following the advice I offered 6 years ago: Stop HP's horribly destructive M&A and spin-off its enterprise, services and software divisions. Indeed, the old HP broke into legacy HP Inc. (HPQ) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) as well as the spin mergers of its service and software divisions.Including its spun-off software (($9 billion) and services ($14 billion), HPQ and HPE together have a market cap of $80 billion. In 2011, I calculated breaking up would give HP an aggregate $80 billion market cap, precisely where we are today. The parts were indeed worth quite a bit more than the whole - $47 billion more, in fact.Sure, HP achieved a lot of success splitting into so many different pieces, but there is still more work to be done, particularly at HP Inc. I'd like to make two suggestions to CEO Dion Weisler to make HP more valuable.#1: It is time for a bold spin-off! Separate your printing division from personal systems.Printing and computers used to go together like peanut butter and jelly. No longer. Gone are the days when we bought a matching desktop and printer! Today, they are very different businesses. Personal systems has nearly twice the sales of printing but less than half the profits. Computers bring in a puny under 4% operating margin while printing racks up a 17% operating margin. Printing doesn't belong under the same roof as the personal division. HP Inc.'s printing gem is hidden under a tired old commodity computer business!(SEC 8-K)"
HP's Bold Acquisition Could Be A Positive For Stockholders,Jul.25.17,"HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) is one of the two publicly traded entities formed out of the November 2015 split of Hewlett-Packard Company. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) is the other entity formed by the split. HPE has since successfully executed a spin merge of its enterprise services business with the former Computer Sciences Corporation to form DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC).HPQ’s business comprises two segments: personal systems (PCs, laptops, tablets, etc.) and printing products and services (print ink, toner, and printers).After being liberated to pursue its own strategic direction, HPQ has been hitting it out of the park under the astute leadership of President and Chief Executive Officer Dion Weisler. In the latest quarter the company delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.40, at the high end of guidance. It grew net revenue by 7% year-over-year to $12.4 billion, driven by growth in Personal Systems and Print – the first quarter in which it has delivered growth in both segments since Q4 2010. Printing revenue grew 2% year-over-year, with both hardware and supplies revenue growing in the same quarter for the first time since Q2 of 2011.Here’s what Mr Weisler had to say on the company’s latest earnings call:Over the last six quarters, we've been building momentum, improving our business fundamentals and delivering on what we said we would do. We’re taking profitable share, out-executing our competitors and delivering some of the best innovation, design and execution in HP's history.In this article I want to focus on a transaction that I believe may be an under-appreciated catalyst for accelerated growth in the Printing segment."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Aruba Leverages High-End Wi-Fi Infrastructure To Enter The Asset Tracking Market,Jun. 5.17,"Aruba, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) company, announced today their new solution for indoor asset tracking. This solution enables small tags to be attached to assets, which are then tracked as they move around a site. Aruba is marketing their solution most strongly in the retail and healthcare industries, in which asset tracking brings particularly a strong return on investment.Most asset tracking solutions on the market are produced by small companies. These solutions involve installing ""locators"" around a site, which track the locations of ""tags"" that are attached to physical assets such as equipment, carts and other movable items. The cost and effort of such systems are often dominated by the infrastructure that must be installed and configured.Aruba's unique proposition is that their asset tracking can use already deployed Wi-Fi access points. Aruba is one of the top high-end Wi-Fi network providers, along with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Extreme Networks (NASDAQ:EXTR) and Ruckus Wireless (NYSE:RKUS). The ability of Aruba's asset tracking solution to leverage their existing Wi-Fi networks means that many enterprise sites will not need to install new infrastructure for asset tracking.Interestingly, while their Wi-Fi networks are used for asset tracking, the asset tracking does not use Wi-Fi. Rather, most of their Wi-Fi access points have been delivered in recent years with Bluetooth Low Energy (known as BLE) capabilities, which can be enabled by software update. Wi-Fi is still used for Aruba's smartphone-based indoor location applications.One of the challenges faced by existing indoor location systems that attempt to leverage Wi-Fi infrastructure is that Wi-Fi access points tend to be installed 80-100 feet apart, which is sufficient for Wi-Fi access but does not give enough overlap to support good indoor location positioning. But when I asked Aruba about this, they said that in recent years their enterprise customers have installed Wi-Fi access points more densely, generally 50ft apart, in order to support voice and video services on mobile devices. In addition to supporting voice and video, this density provides better location positioning."

(NYSE:HPE) Deutsche Bank Technology Conference 2017 September 12, 2017 5:40 PM ETExecutivesTim Stonesifer – Chief Financial OfficerAnalystsSherri Scribner – Deutsche BankSherri ScribnerI think we’re going to get started. Welcome everybody I’m Sherri Scribner, I’m the IT hardware and supply chain analyst at Deutsche Bank. And I’m very pleased to have with us today Hewlett Packard Enterprise’ CFO Tim Stonesifer.I’m going to kick it off with a couple of questions and then I’m going to open it up to the audience for questions. So if you have any questions get ready with your questions.But first may be I’ll start off Tim, HP has been hit by a number of issues this year including high commodity cost, pricing pressure and execution challenges as you divested your services and software businesses from an execution perspective HP was back on track this past quarter you guys reported last Tuesday.Can you talk to some of the challenges you've faced on the execution side over the past few quarters? And where you are now in terms of remedying those issues?Tim StonesiferYes I mean we have certainly been busy with separations. I don’t that's a secret to anyone. So I think particularly in the first quarter where we had some challenges one of the things that I think we underestimated was the impact on the EG personnel. So when you think about the ES separation, we were very focused on that but as an example when you are restructuring in Europe whoever is the leader in that country has to deal with the workers councils and all that and in most cases that was in the G. person it was driving a lot of sales so I think that's well you know one of the execution issues we've had. We've had some challenges on the go-to-market as we've been transitioning and I think those are starting to get higher and out. We have folks that have been in their roles for a longer period of time. They know now what they're doing, very focused. And I think we saw some that come through in the third quarter.Sherri ScribnerYes, oaky. And you mentioned the separation. You guys – just to remind everybody you guys are done with the service the separation you just finished the software separation. And I think you said on a conference call that things are going – you're doing a little bit better than you thought you would have. Is that right and…Tim StonesiferYes I think the – I mean both separations took quite a bit of effort. But if you just look at the scale of it, I mean when we separated ES that was 110,000 employees. So we moved from 160,000, 170,000 folks to 50,000 or 60,000 folks. And that's, I think, from an operational perspective where we really started to feel it and see it as we were operating and that's what led into some of the HPE next initiatives.Sherri ScribnerOkay. We're going to get to that for sure.Tim StonesiferOkay.Sherri ScribnerBut first on the demand environment, the demand environment for your main product segment has been challenged this year. In your view what's been driving this more challenging demand environment? And what's your expectation from when this demand environment will improve at least on the hardware and services side?Tim StonesiferYes I think if I look at it from a geographic perspective, the U.S. has been challenged for sure particularly on the pricing front. I think to be honest with you we saw a little bit of a lift in Q3. Or let's put it this way. I’ll be a little bit more bullish on the market in Q3 versus Q2. We had some good performance in Nimble, we had some good performance in SimpliVity. When I look at Europe. It was a little more balanced. I think balanced – a pretty balanced in Western Europe. I think and we saw some good progress in Germany.And in Asia we saw a bit of a lift we had some double digit growth. If I think about Japan, or China, or India. So the markets are feeling a little bit better, but it is still very competitive out there."

Hewlett Packard Enterprise: Out Of The Woods?,Feb.26.18,"After beating around the bush and disappointing investors for more than a year, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) has given investors a nice surprise: a healthy beat to earnings, driven by growth across all of the company's key IT lines of business. Hewlett Packard Enterprise has been a messy company ever since divorcing from the PC and printer side of the business (which became HP, Inc. (NASDAQ: HPQ)), intending to become an enterprise software and IT-driven company; shortly afterward, Hewlett Packard Enterprise divested its huge software subsidiary to MicroFocus for $8.8 billion in September 2017. For a long time, Hewlett Packard Enterprise looked like a company without direction - and, after hearing about the sale of its profit-driving software arm, I wasn't inclined to believe in Hewlett Packard Enterprise either.But there's a wonderful piece of news underlying these fundamental transformations: Meg Whitman is finally out, and new CEO Antonio Neri is at the helm. Neri - who unlike Whitman, is a former engineering leader - is exactly what Hewlett Packard Enterprise needs to show both customers and investors that the company's innovative spark hasn't gone out. After years of ""business as usual"" under Whitman in which the company continually lost market share and saw declining revenues in nearly every segment, HP looks ready to break out and grow again.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise: Upside Hard To See,Feb.26.18,"Typically, after a large earnings beat and +10% intraday move, as we saw with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) last week, I typically like to dig into the results to determine was truly drove the beat and into individual analysts' view of the report to gauge whether upside remains. In addition to understanding the fundamental prospects for the business and what drove the earnings beat, I find understanding sell-side analyst reactions and in turn, the recommendations they are passing along to their clients, as important in determining whether the stock will continue running or if the majority of upside has been captured by others.Source: HPEEarnings ReviewFollowing HPE's Q1 earnings announcement, which showed the company easily beat consensus revenue and EPS estimates, HPE's stock ripped higher, closing +10.54% for the day. In addition to the Q1 beat on the top and bottom lines, management's Q2 EPS guidance ($0.29-$0.33) and FY EPS guidance ($1.35-1.45) also came in well above consensus of $0.26 and $1.18, respectively. Finally, the company announced it would use repatriated cash to fund a massive $5B share repurchase program and raised the dividend 50%."

Hewlett Packard Enterprise 2018 Q1 - Results - Earnings Call Slides,Feb.23.18,The following slide deck was published by Hewlett Packard Enterprise in conjunction with their 2018 Q1 earnings call.124
"HP Is (Still) A Buy, Even After Incredible Rally",Mar. 6.18,"In September of last year, I posted some bullish thoughts on computer and printer icon Hewlett Packard, now just called HP (HPQ). At the time, it was mostly a lamentation of my then-misplaced preference for former bother Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), though I readily acknowledged the consumer-oriented HP had proven its value on its performance.Since then, HPQ shares have gained more than 20%. I'm glad I bothered to notice and say something.Thing is, as technically overbought as the stock may be here, this is one of those turnaround stories that's not over yet. We're only a little more than halfway through it, and the stock likely has plenty more upside to go before all is said and done.That's the veiled way of saying HP is still a buy.Not a Lot Not to LikeFor the record, the crux of my thesis from six months ago:While the PC market outlook for the foreseeable future is tepid, on average, most observers may be underestimating the future.In its most recently reported quarter, HP reported a 15% increase in sales for Personal Systems… its PC unit. It was the sixth consecutive quarter HP logged a year-over-year increase in PC revenue.To be fair, the rising tide is helping. IDC reported at the beginning of the year that total PC shipments from all vendors grew in the fourth quarter of 2017. It was the first Q4 PC sales increase in six years, up just a hair under 1.0%. Clearly, that tailwind helped. It helped HP a heck of a lot more than it helped its rivals though, underscoring the idea that luck favors the prepared. Hewlett Packard has been redesigning and improving its entire lineup for several quarters now.That modest uptrend is expected to persist as well. Gartner's PC outlook for 2018 calls for 264 million devices to be shipped this year, up from last year's 262 million. Most of that growth will be spurred by ultramobile devices. Laptop and desktop shipments are projected to fall from 204 million last year to 193 million in 2018."
HP Inc. Is Making A Comeback,Feb.26.18,"The strength in HP Inc.'s (NYSE: HPQ) first quarter results, in part, were foreshadowed by the January-dated IDC report which detailed upbeat conditions for the PC market in the critical holiday season. Beset by a yearslong noise that PC replacement cycles were elongating and hardware makers like HP would eventually die out, HP investors have long been awaiting a return to growth - and it seems that time has come.Despite the fact that good results were more or less expected, that didn't stop HP shares from rallying nearly 10% after first-quarter beats to both revenue and earnings. Strength was driven primarily by the PC business, which saw a 7% y/y increase in unit shipments (rare for a company that has seen units decline for an extended period of time), though HP's other behemoth - Printing - also saw strong performance in the quarter.I've been long on HP for a while despite the general perception that the mundane maker of PCs and printers would eventually fold. Since splitting from its enterprise software and services arm, HP Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) - led by the now-ousted Meg Whitman - HP Inc. has surprised investors by being the better-performing of the two stocks. Its much simpler mix of boring businesses has contributed to outperformance, whereas HPE has been beset by a confusing string of acquisitions and divestitures, the majority of which never really worked out.Even through the recent uptrend, investors have still been cautious on buying HP shares, which trade at a substantial discount to the broader market. HP trades at a forward P/E ratio of just 11x (versus the S&P 500 at 16.5x) and yields about 2.5%."

"S&P: Tech sector could ""never look the same again"" after tax reform harm","Feb. 8, 2018 2:55 PM ET","S&P Global Ratings warns investors that the U.S. tax overhaul could harm the tech sector and that it might “never look the same again.”S&P believes “the overall industry credit profile will weaken over time, largely because of the potential for more aggressive financial policies in response to greater access to overseas cash.” S&P notes Apple’s (AAPL -0.6%) plans to go from $163B in cash to becoming net-cash neutral and says this could happen with other companies. Other tech companies with large stashes of overseas cash: Alphabet (GOOGL -2.6%), Cisco (CSCO -2.4%), and Qualcomm (QCOM -3%). S&P also calls out companies with almost as much debt as overseas cash. If those companies repatriated and passed the cash on to shareholders while holding on to the debt, the action would prove harmful to the company’s rating. Companies with overseas cash and debt nearly in balance:  Oracle (ORCL -2.7%), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE -1.9%), Western Digital (WDC -3%), and Intel (INTC -3.9%).

Is Micron Technology The Cheapest Technology Stock?,Jan.17.18,"Micron Technology (MU) designs and manufacturers semiconductor memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) technologies which can be found in servers, graphic cards, and cars or devices like smart phones, tablets and laptops. To see where the company stands from a valuation perspective I decided to compare its financial performance and valuation ratios to other companies throughout the technology industry.First I selected a company which supplies Micron with wafer manufacturing equipment, Lam Research (LRCX). LRCX is a leading supplier of thin film deposition, plasma etch, photoresist strip, and wafer cleaning tools. About 50% of Lams shipments were in the memory segment, where LRCX has a leadership position in vertical 3D-NAND scaling.Next I was thinking about companies which engage with Micron on the other end, its customers. I decided to choose two companies, Hewlett Packert (HPE) and Nvidia (NVDA).HPE emerged in November 2015 after HP Inc (HPQ) and the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company split into two separate entities. Following the separation HPE is now focused on servers, storage, networking, software and services, combined with its financing solutions.Nvidia designs and manufactures computer graphics processors, chipsets, and related multimedia software. They invented the GPU in 1999 and are the absolute leader in GPU sales with a 70% market share.To round the whole thing up I thought it would be good to include an oldschool semiconducter company and colaboration partner, Intel (INTC). They engage in the design, manufacturing, and sales of computer products and technologies, especially CPUs where they have a market share of 70%. The company is transforming from pc-centric to data-centric which now accounts for 45% of its revenues."

"HP, Inc. - Strong Buy On PC Sales Data",Jan.13.18,"Surprise - people are buying PCs again. Long thought to be a dead market after replacement cycles lengthened and tablets/phablets and hybrids like the Microsoft Surface (NASDAQ:MSFT) increased in popularity, it seems that consumers are treating themselves to computers again.When you think about it, this doesn't appear to be a huge surprise - consumer confidence is up, stocks are at record highs, and consumer spending is on the rise, with reports of Christmas sales up ~5% y/y and representing the largest spike in six years. It stands to reason then that some of those dollars flowed into PCs, which have also been in decline for six years.I've been an HP, Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) bull since its stellar earnings report in November, and despite my general aversion to hardware stocks, I can't help but to think that HP is materially undervalued, in the Warren Buffett sense of the word. HP's innovative moat and brand power within PCs (which represents two-thirds of its revenues; the other third derives from printers and printing supplies) cannot be understated. Profits are up double digits this year as HP achieved PC shipment growth even as the rest of the PC industry is stalling - this doesn't sound like a company that deserves to trade at a 12.7x forward P/E, based on analyst consensus estimates of $1.81 in EPS in FY18.Here's a look at HP's one-year chart. The stock has certainly climbed out of its depths, but the ascent in the stock price, in my view, hasn't kept pace with the ascent in its fundamentals. With its above-average earnings growth, HP should be trading at least at 17x forward P/E - in line with the rest of the market - implying a price target of $31. There's plenty of room for this company to ride the bull run higher, especially as it's surfaced from the down-cycle of the PC market.HPQ data by YCharts"

Corporate Bonds After A Spin-Off: Consider The Covenants,"Feb. 2, 2018 7:15 AM ET","By Nathan N.J. Grant, CFAOver 1,000 companies, valued at over $1.3 trillion, have been spun off from their parents over the last decade.Companies resort to spin-offs for a variety of reasons, and while the most common motivation given is to ""unlock shareholder value,"" that goal can be accomplished in different ways. The marketplace ascribes different values to different businesses, and separating certain assets and fine-tuning their capital structures can enable the component parts to command a combined value greater than if they remained together.Stable, mature businesses can often support significantly higher debt loads, while companies in their growth stages may require the added flexibility that carrying less debt provides. A firm might spin off an entity to focus on one specific line of business or market segment. Conversely, a company may believe it can create increased value by permitting one or more separated businesses to pursue diversification opportunities.The new spin-off stock may also be used to fund additional acquisitions, increase market reach, create economies of scale, or incentivize management and employees. A separated company may be more attractive to outside capital. The spin could also be a way to jettison underperforming businesses.The impetus for the spin may come from current management or from outside shareholders, particularly activist investors.Whatever their motivations, spin-offs can have a dramatic effect on the performance of the associated corporate bonds, so it is crucial that fixed-income investors conduct the necessary analysis. Of particular importance are the covenants governing each security. These covenants determine whether the extant bonds will remain outstanding, receive a consent payment to permit the spin, or have to be redeemed.From a covenant perspective, investment grade spin-offs are relatively uncomplicated. The standard investment grade covenant package - negative pledge, limitation on sale/leaseback, and change of control - would not preclude the typical spin-off."
Tesla Jumps The Shark On CEO Compensation,Jan.25.18,"In the effort to enhance executive performance, many firms use stock options and other equity-based compensation methods to align the incentives of management and shareholders. By tying significant portions of executives’ wealth to the share price, or other financial indicators, their prosperity becomes inextricably bound to that of the companies they lead. Some even take it to the extreme, paying CEOs $1 cash salaries but a raft of shares or options. Facebook (FB) and Oracle (ORCL) do this, as did Hewlett-Packard (HP) until 2014.On January 23rd, Tesla Motors (TSLA) became the latest company to transition to pure “performance-based” compensation, announcing that CEO Elon Musk expected to meet a number of major performance milestones in order to unlock huge chunks of stock for himself. If he fails to deliver, he gets nothing. The compensation plan is based principally on share price performance, but also includes revenue and EBITDA milestones. Milestone payments are divided into 12 tranches, each of which would award Musk shares equal to 1% of current shares outstanding. In a best-case scenario, Musk would rake in $70 billion. Not bad for the head of a company that is burning through half a million dollars in cash per hour – and arguably structurally unprofitable."
The Concerns Of An AMD Bull,Mar.21.18,"The preceding year has been good for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in the desktop market, thanks to the launch of Ryzen. There is also optimism around AMD’s performance in servers’ market due to 1-socket strategy and performance of EPYC. Thanks to cryptocurrency mania, graphics card sales are staying on the high side. However, the one segment that remains a challenge for AMD is the portable PC market.Few models to show for…AMD is clearly under-performing in the portable PC, or the notebook market. As of now, despite several months since the availability of Ryzen Mobile platforms, only five laptops from four vendors feature AMD’s Ryzen. Although Ryzen Mobile is available from top vendors including Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Dell (DVMT), Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) and Asus (OTC:AKCPF), it’s not enough given that only one Ryzen model is available from most of the vendors while a myriad of Intel (INTC) options are available.This gives Intel an edge as consumer are always keen about sifting through different models before selecting one. OEMs are not giving AMD a fighting chance in the market. No wonder consumers are likely to select an Intel based notebook if 10 (same specification) models are presented to them including nine Intel-based models and one AMD-based model.It’s a not a question of performanceIt’s not that AMD’s processers are not a par with Intel’s offerings. Cinebench R15, a general purpose CPU benchmark, shows that HP’s Envy x360 has almost identical performance for Ryzen 5 2500U and Intel’s Core i5-8250U in single and multithreading loads, according to notebook check. Moreover, 3D Mark 11 scores are quite higher for Vega 8 than Intel’s embedded graphics solutions. See details here. The notebook head winds for AMD can be traced back to Intel’s marketing superiority or close ties with OEM, or AMDs inability to market its mobile processors adequately; well, we can only speculate."
