What Makes IBM One of America's Best Companies,"Feb 27, 2013 at 11:44AM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) is the original information-technology company. Its roots date back to the late 1800s, and IBM has undergone many successful strategic transitions throughout its life, from a purveyor of early calculating machines to a modern business-focused software provider. Today, IBM is dedicated to creating and advancing innovative technologies to, in its own words, ""make the world work better.""The case for IBMIBM's over 400,000 full-time employees have not been shy about offering their opinions of the company on Glassdoor, but the results are a bit mixed. The company earns a middle-of-the-pack rating of 3.1 stars out of five from nearly 7,000 employees, with 59% of respondents saying they'd recommend the company to a friend seeking a better job. However, as befits a high-tech company, the salary of virtually every position Glassdoor lists at IBM exceeds the 2011 U.S. median household income of $51,400. On LinkedIn, IBM is the 74th most in-demand employer in the world. It's also consistently rated as one of the most diversity-friendly companies in the world, which no doubt flows in part from the direction of CEO Virginia Rometty, who earns a 79% approval rating on Glassdoor.IBM was once seen as a hardware dinosaur, but it's since become the model of successful tech transitions in a software-dominated world. The year before IBM sold its PC division to Lenovo in mid-2005, it generated 32% of its revenue from hardware sales and had an 8.8% net margin. Seven years later, in 2011, IBM earned about 18% of its revenue from hardware -- none of it consumer-focused -- with an overall 14.8% net margin.IBM has rewarded shareholders over the past five years with a 110% return, and during this period its dividend yield has ranged from about 1.5% to nearly 2%. Over the same time frame, IBM's revenue has grown 30% and its net income has grown by 49%, indicating a mastery of the profit margin. In the same time period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average to which IBM belongs has only gained 14%, which means that investors in IBM have enjoyed two-bagger performance above the index -- or a roughly 80% outperformance relative to the Dow's total return when accounting for the dividends of its components.IBM has made a concerted effort to be a good global citizen. It was ranked No. 1 overall in Newsweek's ""America's Greenest Companies"" for 2012, earning high marks for its Smarter Planet initiatives. IBM has also developed energy- and water-management software solutions for its customers, leaving a green imprint far beyond its own walls. IBM has a number of positive social initiatives on its plate, from research on advanced solar technology to Innovation Awards that support the application of technology to the classroom. IBM ranks second on Corporate Responsibility's list of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens of 2012, earning the top rank for environmental initiatives.Areas for improvementNo company is perfect, and even one as well-run as IBM has its shortcomings. IBM took flak over changes stealthily made to its employee pensions and 401(k)s late last year, which moved the company to a one-time matching payment at year-end rather than the per-period matching payments. Any employee leaving before December 15 for non-retirement purposes won't get their yearly match, which could cost employees thousands if they decide to leave for greener pastures. IBM has also slimmed its American workforce by about 30,000 employees while shipping many thousands of jobs overseas, and its old reputation as a place to build a career seems all but wiped out.After analyzing all the available factors, we believe that IBM's benefits to the world -- and its employees -- far outweigh its recent negative actions toward those employees, and it is indeed among the best companies in America.Click here to read about the rest of The 25 Best Companies in America."
IBM and Genentech Introduce a New Era,"Apr 7, 2013 at 2:30PM","On this day in economic and business history ...IBM (NYSE:IBM) knew it had something big on its hands when it introduced the System/360 series of mainframe computers on April 7, 1964. Legendary IBM executive (and son of that other legendary IBM executive) Thomas J. Watson Jr. called the launch ""the most important product announcement in the company's history."" IBM hosted a launch event that would put today's to shame -- a coordinated nationwide reveal attended by more than 100,000 businessmen in 165 cities across the United States.Watson told the world:System/360 represents a sharp departure from concepts of the past in designing and building computers. It is the product of an international effort in IBM's laboratories and plants and is the first time IBM has redesigned the basic internal architecture of its computers in a decade. The result will be more computer productivity at lower cost than ever before. This is the beginning of a new generation -- not only of computers -- but of their application in business, science, and government.Watson was right. System/360 was not a single mainframe, but an entire series of them, with capabilities and costs running the gamut from workhorse to wonder. It was the first time that computers had been designed with upgrades in mind, as the entire range of System/360s shared the same base instruction set and could thus be upgraded without forcing users to learn to use something unfamiliar. System/360s were available at monthly rental costs that ranged from $2,700 to $115,000 -- compared with purchase prices of between $133,000 to $5.5 million -- and users could feel confident that no matter which machine they ordered, they could always upgrade later as their data processing demands grew.The System/360 family became extremely successful in the market, producing some of the strongest business (and stock price) gains in IBM's history. IBM also created a number of industry standards with the System/360 family. Some have since been superseded by newer designs, but the 8-bit byte was possibly the most durable -- it remains the standard to this day.IBM continued to deliver and support System/360s almost up to the release of its PC in 1981, as the last mainframes were delivered to customers in 1978. It's still possible to run applications for System/360 machines in the present day, as IBM's modern System z mainframes are fully backwards compatible with their groundbreaking ancestors.Birth of biotechGenentech was founded on April 7, 1976, becoming the world's first true biotechnology company. Genentech itself tells the story of its founding through the ""GenenLab Notebook,"" part of a welcome kit the company gives to new employees that found its way online in 2012:It all began with an experiment conducted by a team led by Dr. Herbert W. Boyer of the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) and Dr. Stanley N. Cohen of Stanford University. They proved that DNA could be recombined, meaning, in theory, that genetic material from one species could be successfully introduced into the gene of another species. ...In January 1976, Robert A. Swanson, who had been a partner at the venture capital firm of Kleiner & Perkins, telephoned Boyer. Swanson believed that recombinant DNA technology (rDNA, for short) could be employed to create commercial products in a relatively short time, but it seemed that nobody -- including the overwhelming majority of scientists -- agreed with him. Everybody he talked with said it would be 15 to 20 years before that happened.Swanson persuaded Boyer to meet with him for a few minutes. In fact, the meeting lasted two or three hours because Boyer agreed with Swanson on the commercial feasibility of genetic engineering, not in the distant future, but now. ...By the time their initial meeting was over, the two had agreed to organize a new company. They each put up $500. Boyer also came up with a name for the company, derived from GENetic Engineering Technology. (Good thing, because Swanson's suggestion was the HerBob Company.) ... In June, on the basis of an eight-page business plan, Kleiner & Perkins agreed to provide $100,000 in venture capital funding, which lasted Genentech nine months. At least Swanson could now take a small salary.Genentech would eventually develop a number of important new medical products, beginning with synthetic insulin, its very first FDA-approved product in 1982, and the first genetically engineered human theraputic. Genentech's success eventually led to one of the largest acquisitions in health-care history, as Roche (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY) took full control of Genentech for roughly $47 billion in 2009 after holding majority ownership since 1990.The star of the oil industryTexas Company -- popularly known as Texaco -- was officially formed in Beaumont, Texas on April 7, 1902. Originally devised as a transport and pipeline operation to take advantage of the massive oil flow from the nearby Spindletop field, Texaco would grow into a fully integrated exploration and production company a year later, with the tapping of a 5,000-barrel-per-day well at nearby Sour Lake Springs. The company's success was rapid and notable -- within only 13 years, Texas Company would become the first oil enterprise to ever earn a place on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI). This index membership continued, with one small interruption from 1924 to 1925, for more than 75 years.By 1928, Texaco was the first company to operate a unified sales network of one branded gasoline. Texaco developed modern service stations in 1937, with the familiar car wash, mechanic bays, sales office, restrooms, and large street-facing brand signs. In 1959, Texas Company officially changed its name to Texaco, which it retained until merging with Chevron (NYSE:CVX) in 2001 to create one of the world's largest integrated oil companies, under the Chevron brand.Can you see me now?The first public demonstration of long-range television transmission in history took place in an AT&T (NYSE:T) Bell Labs auditorium on April 7, 1927. AT&T brought future President and then-Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover to the demonstration to serve as the subject of the transmission, where he said to those gathered on both sides: ""Today we have, in a sense, the transmission of sight for the first time in the world's history. Human genius has now destroyed the impediment of distance in a new respect, and in a manner hitherto unknown.""It was just one year later that television broadcasts began in the United States, but they were hardly entertaining -- early viewers were just getting the shadows of popular programs, which would have been all but impossible to make out. True broadcasts as we now consider them didn't gain popularity until the mid-1930s, and although color televisions had been tested shortly after AT&T's Hoover broadcast, it was not made commercially available until after World War II. Those woebegone Depression-era folks might not have been so depressed, if only they'd had TV -- assuming they could afford it, of course.10 better buys than the Dow Jones Industrial AverageWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Secrets to Success for the World's Oldest Tech Company,"Apr 20, 2013 at 3:35PM","Technology is a pretty brutal sector of the economy. Billion-dollar behemoths can have the rug pulled out from beneath them by a couple of kids in a garage. Today's biggest and best supercomputer is liable to be as good as the smartphone (or smart brain implant, perhaps) of tomorrow's children. Scale doesn't really matter. If you can out-innovate the leader today, you can out-scale them tomorrow.Yet, somehow, IBM (NYSE:IBM) is still here. Most of the tech companies you think of as ""old"" are younger than your parents, or got into the tech game decades after their founding. Since its earliest days, way back in the late 1880s, IBM has been all about developing and profiting from technology. The company's been on top of the tech world for so long that it's now paid dividends for almost 100 years -- three payments in 1913, and then quarterly distributions since 1916.How has IBM stayed so consistent and so profitable for so long? It all comes down to three basic principles:The market matters more than the machine.Don't be afraid to try something new, even if it threatens you.""THINK.""High-tech originsCutting-edge technology will only take you so far, as I've already mentioned, but it can take a company pretty far while it retains a technological edge. IBM's foundational technology, from which its predecessor, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, derives the middle part of its name, was Herman Hollerith's tabulating machine:SOURCE: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS .Pretty old-school, isn't it? This little gizmo cut the time it took to process the United States census from eight years to one year, with the national population total of 62.9 million reported after only six weeks of work. Hollerith's Tabulating Machine Company was soon recognized as the best and most defensible business of the four merged to create C-T-R in 1911, which established IBM's identity from the start as a provider of technological solutions for businesses (and sometimes for governments).The man behind the machinesThe man who recognized the importance of the machines would be the one who laid down IBM's three core principles: Thomas J. Watson, brought aboard as general manager in 1914 and made the company's president less than a year later.Watson might have been many things -- a good manager, an innovative thinker, a controversial amateur diplomat -- but first and foremost, Thomas J. Watson was a great salesman. Before arriving at IBM in 1914, Watson built his reputation by brutally outmuscling competitors at the head of National Cash Register's (NYSE:NCR) Rochester, N.Y., sales office. A great salesman has to know his audience, and Watson understood that the best customers of IBM's best product would be larger data-driven businesses, at least to the extent that businesses could be data-driven in those days. Thus he instilled from day one the corporate culture that prized customer relationships as much as technology.That's not to say that Watson was anything near a Luddite. He understood that a technology company is only as good as the minds it contains, and when he arrived from NCR, he also brought along a personal mantra: ""THINK.""Legend has it that Watson coined the mantra in a sales meeting, interrupting something tedious to point out: ""[T]he trouble with every one of us is that we don't think enough. We don't get paid for working with our feet -- we get paid for working with our heads."" Watson emphasized this by writing the word THINK on the meeting room blackboard.""We get paid for working with our heads.""(NYSE:F)Watson needed his employees to use their heads, and they did -- the company's revenues doubled in the first four years of his leadership. In the 1920s, IBM expanded again into time recording products and continued to advance the technology behind its punched-card tabulators, which would set standards for the format that remained in place until digital computation swept punched cards into history's dustbin decades later. During this time, IBM firmly established itself as a technology powerhouse, and the company opened its first modern research lab in Endicott, N.Y., in 1932.Watson's commitment to producing cutting-edge technology for deep-pocketed enterprises was soundly validated when the company won a contract (all but unopposed) to supply tabulating equipment for the newly instituted Social Security Administration in 1935. Called ""the largest accounting operation of all time,"" the timely contract ensured that IBM would be a major U.S. government supplier for many years and gave the company a financial foundation from which to grow.Out with the oldBy the end of the second World War, real computers -- bulky, clunky, hard-wired, and very limited, but still computers -- began to appear. Although IBM was essentially a ""tech"" company, the pre-transistor era experienced far slower rates of progress than the period following the transistor's invention in 1947. The company had relied on punched-card technology for so long that it was hard to imagine moving on to something newer and unproven. Watson didn't see the company through the dawn of the computer era, but his legacy lived on in his son, Thomas J. Watson Jr., who assumed leadership after his father's death in 1956.In many ways, the son would surpass the father. He oversaw the development and sale of the 701, IBM's first commercial scientific computer, four years before assuming company leadership. On his ascent to the corner office, Junior restructured the company with a greater focus on research and development and reaffirmed IBM's commitment to large business and government clients at a time when the market for computing products was starting to expand dramatically.A year after becoming CEO, Watson Jr. made innovation a mandate by barring further development on vacuum-tube machines in favor of solid-state circuitry. The 701 used vacuum tubes. Within Watson Jr.'s first two years at the helm, IBM saw the end of antitrust actions against its dominant data-processing machines, designed the first example of artificial intelligence, created the first high-level programming language, and built the world's first hard disk drive, shown below:SOURCE: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS .Watson Jr. took over a company with nearly $1 billion in annual sales and, just as his father before him, doubled IBM's revenue in his first four years at the helm. By the end of those first four years, almost no trace remained of the company's tabulating-machine origins. Despite this dramatic change, IBM held true to its roots while embracing Watson Jr.'s intensified push for innovation. IBM under Watson Jr. freely made its old products obsolete, notably in the 1960s with the launch of the System/360 mainframe line and in a 1969 decision to split hardware and software sales. Watson Jr. retired in 1971 after a heart attack, leaving behind a company more than nine times larger (and 12 times as profitable) as the one he'd inherited in 1956. He also left a research-driven culture that has now produced five Nobel Prize winners, all awarded in the years after Watson Jr.'s retirement.A near-fatal detourIBM's lowest ebb as a public company must have come in early 1993, when it was fresh off a $5 billion annual loss (the worst in history at that time) and facing the near-certainty of another terrible year. IBM had created the PC standard and had then gifted the richest slices of that standard to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which made the two most essential elements of what quickly became reverse-engineered commodity hardware. IBM was making boxes. Anyone could have made those boxes, and many competitors did so at a lower cost.SOURCE: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS.IBM had rushed to market with off-the-shelf parts, and the companies making those parts got rich. The company had strayed from its mission of building technological solutions for businesses and came as close as it ever has to eliminating its dividend. Despite cutting the payout by 80% in 1993, IBM held on -- thanks to the timely hiring of Louis V. Gerstner as its new chief executive.Gerstner is best-known for shifting IBM away from unprofitable consumer electronics and back into high-margin business technology services, returning the company to a business model frequently used in the Watson Jr. era. Gerstner also renewed the company's focus on cutting-edge research, which has given the world a succession of increasingly impressive forms of artificial intelligence -- first Deep Blue, and later Watson, the Jeopardy!-playing supercomputer named for IBM's first great executive.The market was always businesses and the focus was always on innovation, but IBM almost failed by straying from those core principles during the PC era. Its renewed success today is perhaps luck as much as anything. Would the company be where if it hadn't hired Gerstner in 1993? Still, luck can only take you so far. Today, IBM is best known as a software and services company. What will it become in the future? Shareholders can rest easy knowing that the company should be consistently strong, as long as it remembers its core principles."
IBM vs. AT&T: Which Dow Stock's Dividend Dominates?,"May 13, 2013 at 11:30AM","Dividend stocks outperform non-dividend-paying stocks over the long run. It happens in good markets and bad, and the benefit of dividends can be quite striking -- dividend payments have made up about 40% of the market's average annual return from 1936 to the present day. But few of us can invest in every single dividend-paying stock on the market, and even if we could, we might find better gains by being selective. That's why we'll be pitting two of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's (DJINDICES:^DJI) dividend payers against each other today to find out which Dow stock is the true dividend champion. Let's take a closer look at our two contenders now.Tale of the tapeIBM (NYSE:IBM) will be a 34-year veteran of the Dow by the end of next month. Based in the suburbs north of New York City, IBM has been producing cutting-edge technology for over a century, which gives it real claim to the title of ""World's Oldest Tech Company."" IBM employs over 430,000 people, but it's remarkably nimble for such a massive company. ""Nonstrategic"" parts of IBM's business worth a total of $15 billion in annual revenue have been divested over the past decade, and its three major new initiatives (Smarter Planet, data analytics, and cloud services) all enjoyed double-digit revenue growth in 2012. Due to the Dow's price-weighting system, IBM is its single most important component -- a move in IBM stock prices will have several times the impact of a move in nearly every other stock on the Dow.AT&T (NYSE:T) has been part of the Dow for over 13 years under its new corporate identity, but the original telecom has been a component in one form or another, without interruption, for 74 years. Like IBM, AT&T was one of the earlier Dow components, but was removed during the tumultuous Roaring '20s (IBM actually lost its original spot on the Dow to AT&T in 1939 when the latter rejoined). Although AT&T is now primarily known as a wireless service provider (it has 107 million wireless subscribers), the company also provides broadband access, cable television subscriptions, and other connectivity services. All told, AT&T's Internet backbone carries an estimated 33 petabytes of data each day. That's over 15 million hours of high-definition streaming video!StatisticIBM AT&TMarket cap$226.7 billion$201.0 billionP/E Ratio14.129.1Trailing 12-month profit margin16.1%5.8%TTM free cash flow margin*15.0%15.8%Five-year total return 77.9%25.9%SOURCE: MORNINGSTAR AND YCHARTS.* FREE CASH FLOW MARGIN IS FREE CASH FLOW DIVIDED BY REVENUE FOR THE TRAILING 12 MONTHS.Although IBM squeaks ahead on market cap and profit margin while posting a far better total return for the past five years, AT&T is no slouch on free cash flow, which is an important consideration for dividend sustainability. Which of these two old-guard tech purveyors will triumph today?Round one: enduranceBoth IBM and AT&T have a long history of dividends. IBM began paying dividends all the way back in 1913, and has been making quarterly distributions since 1916, for a 97-year streak. However, AT&T's dividend history dates all the way back to 1893, for an uninterrupted streak of 120 years. Sorry, IBM. This is one contest you joined too late.Winner: AT&T, 1-0.Round two: stabilityPaying dividends is well and good, but how long have our two companies been increasing their dividends? The same dividend payout year after year can quickly fall behind a rising market, and there's no better sign of a company's financial stability than a rising payout in a weak market (as long as it's sustainable, of course).IBM suffered a tough time in the early 1990s as its commitment to competing for PC market share eroded profitability. The company had to lower dividends as a result, which means that dividend growth has only been under way since 1996. AT&T, on the other hand, has been raising its payouts since 1959, following an extended streak of stable dividends.Winner: AT&T, 2-0.Round three: powerIt's not that hard to commit to paying back shareholders, but are these payments enticing, or merely tokens? Let's take a look at how both companies have maintained their dividend yields over time as their businesses and share prices have grown:IBM DIVIDEND YIELD DATA BY YCHARTSWinner: AT&T, 3-0.Round four: strengthA stock's yield can stay high without much effort if its share price doesn't budge, so let's take a look at the growth in payouts over the past five years. If you bought in several years ago and the company's grown its payout substantially, your real yield is likely look much better than what's shown above. This one looks to be just as close as the last one:IBM DIVIDEND DATA BY YCHARTSWinner: IBM, 1-3.Round five: flexibilityA company -- even one as well-positioned as IBM or AT&T -- needs to manage its cash wisely to ensure that there's enough available for tough times. Paying out too much of its free cash flow in dividends could be a warning sign that the dividend is at risk, particularly if business weakens. This next metric analyzes just how much of their free cash flows our two companies have paid out in dividends over the past four quarters:IBM CASH DIV. PAYOUT RATIO TTM DATA BY YCHARTSWinner: IBM, 2-3.Despite a spirited comeback, IBM simply can't overcome AT&T's advantage of time. Had the company not bungled the transition from mainframes to PCs so badly, things might have turned out differently, as IBM boasted a strong history of dividend growth before those two awful years of historic unprofitability. There's no doubt that the strength of AT&T's market position will help it keep its yield high for years to come -- but will that be enough to make it a better buy than the faster-growing IBM?"
The Death of the Dot-Com Era and the Long Fall of the Nasdaq,"Mar 10, 2013 at 11:00AM","On this day in economic and financial history ...The Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) reached its all-time high on March 10, 2000, only a day after breaking the 5,000-point barrier. It was a positive day by only the slimmest of margins, as the tech-heavy index tacked on only 1.78 points to close at 5,048.64. At the same time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI), which was already 15% lower than its mid-January peak, fell further as its component drugmakers and financials shed value over fears of higher interest rates. It was a highly symbolic day, according to CNNMoney, as the Nasdaq held above 5,000 while the Dow sank beneath the 10,000-point level for only the fourth time since the previous April.The Nasdaq's peak became the ultimate investing cautionary tale in later years, as swarms of pundits emerged to say ""I told you so!"" Where were they when the bubble was inflating to dangerous levels? Dot-com analysts pointed to ""momentum"" and ""insatiable demand"" without considering the financial fundamentals of the Nasdaq's many bubbly stocks. One of these analysts simply said that ""if you're an astute observer, your portfolio will reflect what's new and exciting and dynamic."" Everyone was buying trendy stocks because everyone was buying trendy stocks. It was circular logic at its finest.A book titled Dow 100,000 had been published only half a year before the Nasdaq's peak, and it became widely mocked after the bust for its wide-eyed optimism. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, having apparently forgotten his 1996 pronouncement that the market suffered from ""irrational exuberance,"" noted on March 10 that CEOs Jack Welch and Lou Gerstner of economic bellwethers General Electric (NYSE:GE) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) were both enraptured by the market's rise. Greenspan quoted the two executives as believing it was a ""true revolution"" and that ""they have seen nothing like this in their experience.""That revolution sputtered out once investors realized that fundamentals simply couldn't support their optimism, and the endless economic expansion of the '90s wasn't so endless after all. The Nasdaq's P/E was well into triple-digit territory in the spring of 2000, aping a similar valuation bubble that blew Japan's Nikkei index to the moon in the 1980s. And just as the Nikkei fell for a generation, the Nasdaq has also been looking up at March 10, 2000, ever since. A decade after that peak, the Nasdaq had lost 63% with inflation taken into account, compared with a real decline of 28% in the Dow over the same time frame. GE and IBM, which both set all-time marks near the Nasdaq's peak, have spent more than a decade struggling to reclaim those levels. Still, they've done better than many Nasdaq stocks. A fifth of 1999's newly public companies fell off the Nasdaq completely by the end of 2000, and half of the rest had lost more than half of their initial value.The Nasdaq's slide continues to be a low point for American markets many years later. Mark Hulbert of MarketWatch pointed out in early 2013 that ""no other bear market in U.S. stock market history has been as awful as the Nasdaq's since 2000."" In real terms, it was still 53% lower than its 2000 peak at the time, which makes it a worse performance than either the Dow's brutal Depression-era secular bear market or the stagflationary weakness that kept returns low from 1966 to 1982. There's still time for the Nasdaq to regain ground over these periods, but it's going to take a very strong performance -- perhaps on the scale of the 1990s -- to recapture its old heights.I think it's for you""Mr. Watson, come here -- I want to see you."" Alexander Graham Bell had just spoken the first words ever heard through a telephone on March 10, 1876. This landmark utterance actually occurred three days after Bell had gained the first telephone patent ever issued in the United States, which was an unusual ordering in those days -- most patents were granted only after proof of concept. The race to create the telephone led to one of the great patent battles of American corporate history, as Bell fought off other inventors with better business acumen and cleverer legal tactics. This first phone call -- and the legal victories that followed -- led to the rise of AT&T (NYSE:T) as a national monopoly, as Bell's control of the industry strengthened in the years thereafter. Click here to read more about the innovation, intrigue, and subterfuge behind the creation of the telephone and the birth of AT&T.Thomas Edison, patent trollLegendary inventor Thomas Edison is so well known in large part because of his prolific use of the patent, and his subsequent dogged defense of those patents. However, not all of these defenses worked out. Edison lost an important patent lawsuit against American Mutoscope & Biograph on March 10, 1902, severely eroding his exclusive claim over the nascent field of motion pictures.A circuit court decision, written by Judge William Wallace (middle name James; no known relation to the famous Scotsman played by Mel Gibson), states:It is obvious that Mr. Edison was not a pioneer, in the large sense of the term, or in the more limited sense in which he would have been if he had also invented the film. He was not the inventor of the film. He was not the first inventor of apparatus capable of producing suitable negatives, taken from practically a single point of view, in single-line sequence, upon a film like his. ... Undoubtedly Mr. Edison, by utilizing this film and perfecting the first apparatus for using it, met all the conditions necessary for commercial success. This, however, did not entitle him, under the patent laws, to a monopoly of all camera apparatus capable of utilizing the film. Nor did it entitle him to a monopoly of all apparatus employing a single camera.The decision reopened the floodgates of film competition, but it also pushed Edison toward a strategy of highly specific patents over numerous subsets of the filmmaking process. This new strategy -- common among hardware and software companies today -- allowed Edison to regain his dominance of the Eastern motion picture industry and also established a modern precedent of control over a new technology by patenting small but vital elements of its design. Edison's early East Coast competitors, eventually worn down by further patent suits, agreed in 1908 to create the Motion Picture Patents Company, the earliest motion-picture trust.The MPPC had a major role in the rise of Hollywood, as its many restrictions on the filmmaking process pushed creative experimentation to the West Coast, far from the easy reach of Edison's patent lawyers and the courts that looked favorably on his claims. On the other hand, Edison did invent the lolcat video, so he had a fairly good idea of what people wanted to watch:Eventually, the MPPC trust was broken by federal antitrust action in 1917, which only encouraged the establishment of another trust -- this one centered in Hollywood and built on the production and distribution of motion pictures, rather than on the patent system.

Celebrating One of the Greatest IPOs of All Time,"Mar 13, 2013 at 11:33AM","On this day in economic and financial history...""In over-the-counter trading, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) rose $7, to $28, on its first day of trading."" Where were you on March 13, 1986, when one of the greatest IPOs of all time barely merited a mention in the nation's newspapers? The Microsoft IPO, which set Bill Gates on the path to wealthiest-man-in-the-world status and established the company behind MS-DOS as a serious contender, earned only one sentence from The New York Times on its first day on the market -- and not a word from the other major American papers. However, the event attracted greater notice when Fortune magazine featured it in a July issue that year:Going public is one of capitalism's major sacraments, conferring instant superwealth on a few talented and lucky entrepreneurs. Of the more than 1,500 companies that have undergone this rite of passage in the past five years, few have enjoyed a more frenzied welcome from investors than Microsoft, the Seattle-based maker of software for personal computers. Its shares, offered at $21 on March 13, zoomed to $35.50 on the over-the-counter market before settling back to a recent $31.25. Microsoft and its shareholders raised $61 million. The biggest winner was William H. Gates III, the company's co-founder and chairman. He got only $1.6 million for the shares he sold, but going public put a market value of $350 million on the 45% stake he retains. A software prodigy who helped start Microsoft while still in his teens, Gates, at 30, is probably one of the 100 richest Americans.The wonder is that Microsoft waited so long. Founded in 1975, it is the oldest major producer of software for personal computers and, with $172.5 million in revenues over the last four quarters, the second largest after Lotus Development. Microsoft's biggest hits are the PC-DOS and MS-DOS operating systems, the basic software that runs millions of IBM (NYSE:IBM) personal computers and clones. The company has also struck it rich with myriad versions of computer languages and a slew of fast-selling applications programs such as spreadsheets and word-processing packages for IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and other personal computers.By 1986 it was becoming clear that the IBM PC model would dominate the personal-computing industry. Thanks to an easily reverse-engineered design, the PC and its clones had displaced the Commodore 64 by 1984 and would capture more than half the market by the end of 1986. Apple, which had gone public in 1980 to greater acclaim and more widespread public interest, saw its shares sink below their IPO price by the time Microsoft debuted. Apple's shares were then suffering the aftermath of Steve Jobs' ouster and the reality of persistently low market share in a fast-growing industry. Microsoft, on the other hand, was already well-established as a profit gusher, posting a net margin of up to 34% in the period leading up to its IPO.Microsoft was only a few months removed from the launch of Windows 1.0 and would release the first iteration of its massively popular Office productivity suite four years later. The Office launch coincided with the release of Windows 3.0, which was the beginning of Windows' dominance. These popular programs catapulted Microsoft's shares to a 1,300% gain in its first five years on the public markets -- but this was only the start. Windows 95 became the catalyst for another 350% share-price gain in the following five years.By the time Microsoft celebrated its 13th IPO anniversary in 1999, shareholders from day one had enjoyed a 41,000% gain on their initial investment. Microsoft topped out at an all-time maximum gain of more than 60,000% at the height of the dot-com boom, with a market cap of more than $600 billion. Adjusted for inflation, Microsoft remains the largest American company in history, and its staggering post-IPO success -- shares had still returned more than 28,000% two decades after the IPO -- makes it one of the most successful public debuts of all time. That's not on the basis of IPO proceeds, but in long-term shareholder returns. And, yes, that's far better than Apple's 20-year performance. At the same point in its public life, the iPhone maker was only a three-bagger.Good as goldThe price of gold reached $1,000 per ounce for the first time on March 13, 2008. This should have been no surprise, considering the debt-fueled economic slowdown then underway, which the Federal Reserve (and other central banks) had been attempting to combat through lowered interest rates. However, gold had begun rising early in the new millennium with relatively little slack even during a period of supposed economic strength. UBS metal strategist Robin Bhar told CNNMoney: ""The current environment is such that the doom and gloom scenario plays right into investors' hands. ... Though forecasts point to no recession, hedge fund clients are quite fearful right now.""The National Bureau of Economic research would later confirm that a recession was then already underway. Even the end of that recession did little to halt the rise of gold, which topped out at nearly $2,000 per ounce in 2011. Only the post-Nixon gold bubble of the 1970s surpassed the growth of gold over the first decade of the 21st century, as its inflation-adjusted peak was near $2,500 per ounce in early 1980.Oil must flowLeaders of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, finally lifted their crippling embargo against the United States on March 13, 1974. The embargo, enacted the previous October, had been a measure of revenge against the U.S. for its support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War. American peace initiatives seemed enough to assure Arab ministers that they had seized the upper hand against Israel and its allies after failing to do so with a surprise attack.The embargo had indeed been a terrible vengeance: A barrel of oil quadrupled in price, from $3 to $12, over the course of the embargo. This action, and President Nixon's 1971 decision to take the U.S. off the gold standard, combined to create one of the worst postwar economic climates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) lost 45% of its value during a highly inflationary bear-market period, but most of the decline actually occurred after the embargo lifted, as the economic impact took some time to work its way through the American system.The triumphant conclusion of OPEC's embargo proved to be the high point of the organization's power. Another oil price shock at the end of the 1970s came as a result of instability and war in Iran, which was not part of the cartel. Shortly after Iran again stabilized, the world entered a period of oil surpluses that pushed prices down to historic lows. The 1973 embargo was a short-term success, but in the long run it had forced other nations to explore for oil more intently and focus more on energy efficiency initiatives. A decade after the embargo ended, the U.S. was importing less than 30% of its oil, which was a substantial decline from the near-50% importation rate it had sustained during the oil-scarce 1970s.10 better buys than the Dow Jones Industrial AverageWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

Best Investments for the Next 5 Years,"Apr 9, 2013 at 7:15PM","It's nearly impossible to project anything five years out. If it were easy, we'd all know what stocks to put in our portfolio. Ironically, however, thinking long-term is a healthy habit for stock market investors. It filters out the noise and helps investors think about the underlying fundamentals that drive businesses over the long haul. In the next few paragraphs, I'll uncover two stocks that could make some of the best investments over the next half-decade.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)PC sales are declining, and smartphone and tablet sales are booming. If there's one company that is sure to benefit from this trend over the next five years, it's Apple. Yes, Apple may have lost market share over the last 12 months to Samsung, but it still captures the majority of worldwide smartphone profits. In fact, a recent study by Canaccord Genuity found that Apple took 72% of worldwide handset profits in the fourth quarter.Another favorable factor for Apple: It is a cash cow. Even as the company's margins continue to decline, it's still adding far more money to its balance sheet than it's paying out in dividends. In 2012 alone, the company earned $46.3 billion in free cash flow on $164.7 billion in revenue. Free cash flow, of course, is equal to cash provided by operations minus capital expenditures, so this is the cash Apple generated after it took care of its operating expenses and its long-term investments.Though 2013 may have been tough on the stock so far, analysts, on average, expect earnings to increase at about 19% annually over the next five years.Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) (NYSE:BRK-A)The Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, seems to be on his A game -- even at 82 years old. Berkshire Hathaway shares almost tripled the S&P 500's 11.8% return over the last 12 months, with a 30.1% gain. Even better, his lieutenants, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have both managed to outperform the S&P 500 by double-digit margins. In fact, they did better than Buffett himself, he admitted in the 2012 annual letter to shareholders.Though it's too early to tell whether Berkshire's acquisition of H.J. Heinz will play out nicely, the outcomes of the company's major acquisitions and purchases over the last five years have in time mostly silenced the naysayers who so eagerly criticized Buffett at the time of the purchases.A case in point is the company's largest acquisition ever: Burlington Northern Santa Fe, which it acquired in 2010 and turned out to be a significant success. In 2010, the company earned $2.45 billion; just two years later, the railroad contributed a whopping $3.37 billion to Berkshire's earnings. Since Berkshire acquired BNSF, the Dow Jones U.S. Railroads Index has more than doubled the returns of the S&P 500, snapping up a return in excess of 80%.Berkshire isn't lacking in stock ideas, either. In 2011, Berkshire started picking up shares of IBM like nobody's business. Now Berkshire owns 6.1% of the company. The stock has gained about 15% since Buffett started buying.The management of the well-diversified conglomerate of exceptional businesses hasn't lost its touch at capital allocation, which will ultimately be the driver of future growth.What are your picks?I think these could be among the best investments over the next half-decade. In fact, I've made outperform CAPScalls on both stocks. Do you think these stocks are great bets for the next five years?

25 Surprising Facts About Berkshire Hathaway,"May 2, 2013 at 11:27PM","This article has been updated on 11/6/20141. For the five-year period ending 2013, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) underperformed the S&P 500. This was the first such underperformance in 44 such five-year periods since Buffett took the helm in 1964. 2. If you had taken $10,000 back then and achieved the same rate of return as Berkshire's growth in per share book value, at the end of 2013 you would have had $69,351,800.3. Under Buffett, Berkshire shareholders have collected just one dividend: A $0.10 per share payout in 1967. Buffett jokes he ""must have been in the bathroom when that decision was made.""4. Berkshire's roots go back more than 174 years to the founding of textile manufacturer Valley Falls Company, which itself merged with Berkshire Cotton Manufacturing Company in 1929. The resulting company merged with Hathaway Manufacturing to create Berkshire Hathaway in 1955.5. In 2010, Warren Buffett said he considered Berkshire the ""dumbest"" stock he ever bought. Why? Because in 1962 he acquired his controlling stake in anger when one of its managers short-changed him in a tender offer to the tune of $0.125 per share. After he fired the manager, Buffett realized he had committed too much of his money to a ""terrible"" textiles business, which he fought to save for 20 years before giving up. By Buffett's estimation, that mistake cost him more than $200 billion in compounded returns. 6. In 1981, just 12 people attended Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting. This year, an estimated 40,000 shareholders made the trip to Omaha.7. Over the course of just nine hours at last year's annual meeting, Berkshire shareholders bought 1,062 pairs of Justin Boots, 12,792 pounds of See's candy, 11,162 Quikut knives, and 6,344 pairs of Wells Lamont gloves. No wonder Buffett joked a few months earlier, ""Anyone who says money can't buy happiness simply hasn't shopped at our meeting.""8. At the end of 2013, Berkshire employed 330,745 people.9. That included just 25 people at Berkshire's headquarters office -- a testament to Buffett's decentralized management structure, which entrusts business unit leaders to make the best possible decisions with minimal bureaucracy.10. Not including its equity holdings, Berkshire is made up of 57 distinct subsidiary businesses.11. That doesn't include the 25 smaller companies on which Berkshire quietly spent $3.1 billion last year as ""bolt-on"" acquisitions to be melded into its existing operations.12. In keeping with his principles on maintaining an adequate margin of safety, Buffett insists on having at least $20 billion in cash on Berkshire's balance sheet at any given time.13. Berkshire's insurance operations have operated at an underwriting profit for the past 11 consecutive years, good for a total pre-tax gain of $22 billion -- and an incredible feat in the insurance industry. For some context, consider rival insurer State Farm (a well-managed company in its own right) has operated at an underwriting loss for nine of the last 13 years.14. GEICO's Gecko got a mention in Buffett's latest shareholder letter in praise for the company's outstanding performance and ability to ""gobble up market share year after year."" Still, I think GEICO's ""Did you know"" ad campaign deserves at least some credit:15. As of the middle of last year, Berkshire's MidAmerican energy had 2,285 megawatts of energy generation capacity coming from 1,267 wind turbines, making it the No. 1 owner of wind-powered energy generation among U.S. rate-regulated entities. 16. That doesn't include another 1,050 megawatts of capacity -- dubbed the ""Wind VIII expansion -- which MidAmerican is adding in Iowa by year-end 2015. Once that expansion is complete, roughly 39% of MidAmerican's total owned generation capacity will come from 1,715 wind turbines.17. But don't forget solar power, which currently comprises just 8% of MidAmerican's renewable generation capacity. In particular, consider its 579 Megawatt Antelope Valley Solar joint venture with SunPower Corporation (NASDAQ:SPWR), construction for which began last year and is expected to complete by the end of 2015. When all is said and done, this project will have provided 650 jobs and more than $500 million in regional economic impact, and should provide enough clean energy to power around 255,000 average California homes.18. Berkshire's currently carries about 15% of all inter-city freight in the U.S. through its Burlington Northern Santa Fe subsidiary. That calculation includes all goods transported by truck, rail, water, air, or pipeline.19. Even better, BNSF is able to carry each ton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel, which is around four times more efficient than the trucking industry.20. Buffett is rapidly increasing the equity portfolio responsibilities of 43 year-old Todd Combs and 50 year-old Ted Weschler, both of whom have worked for Berkshire for less than 4 years. By the end of 2013, Buffett says both Combs and Weschler had each ""handily"" outperformed the S&P 500, and collectively managed around $14 billion of Berkshire's money.21. Weschler, a former managing partner of the Peninsula Capital Advisors hedge fund, won the job after placing the winning bid in both 2010 and 2011 for Buffett's annual charity auction to the benefit of San Francisco's Glide foundation. Though he remained anonymous until after his hiring was announced, Weschler paid more than $2.6 million each year to have lunch with Buffett.22. While Buffett owns nearly 14.5% of American Express through Berkshire, he says the best advice he can offer young people is to avoid credit cards. Why? In his words: ""If I borrowed money at 18 or 20 percent, I'd be broke.""23. Berkshire ""lost"" around $2.5 billion last month after its huge stakes in both IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) plummeted following the companies' respective disappointing quarterly financial results. But Buffett was likely thrilled about those short-term losses considering he suggested earlier this year Berkshire's ownership interest in both IBM and Coke was likely to increase in the future. In the end, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if Buffett used the drops as an opportunity to add to his positions.24. In times of financial duress, Berkshire is more than happy to lend a hand to other struggling companies, including loans of $3 billion and $5 billion to Swiss Re and Bank of America in 2009 and 2011, respectively, as well as loans in 2008 to both Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and General Electric for $5 billion and $3 billion, respectively. Of course, each of those loans made Buffett a bundle of money, with the Goldman Sachs deal culminating last year in Berkshire becoming one of Goldman's top 10 shareholders for next to nothing.25. Buffett holds more than 98 percent of his $70.2 billion net worth in Berkshire Hathaway stock, and plans to gradually give nearly all of it to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation before he dies. Through the Giving Pledge he and Mrs. Gates formed in June, 2010, they have so far convinced over 120 more of the world's wealthiest individuals and families to follow suit, giving at least half their wealth to philanthropy or charitable causes either during their lifetime or after their death. 10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway (A shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It's Time to Buy Xerox Stock. Here's Why.,"May 26, 2013 at 11:45AM","It might not be obvious to the casual observer, but right now, today, Xerox (NYSE:XRX) stock offers one of the best values available in the IT industry. Why?Three reasons.Xerox stock is cheapWhen you stack up Xerox stock against two of its rivals in the international ""business process outsourcing"" industry -- Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) -- it's clear that Xerox is one of the cheapest options out there. Its 9.7 price-to-earnings ratio falls 32% below the P/E of IBM. It sells for a whopping 45% discount to the price of a share of Accenture.And as is so often the case, with a low valuation comes a big boost in dividend yield. Xerox stock currently yields a tidy 2.6% dividend. That's as compared with Accenture and IBM, both of which yield less than 2%.Xerox: A cheap price for low expectationsWhy aren't investors paying up for Xerox stock (yet)? Part of the reason, one presumes, is because no one's expecting the stock to do very much over the next five years. Of the three firms named, Xerox currently sports the lowest projected growth rate.But while that sounds bad, if you turn this fact on its head, low expectations might actually turn out to be good news for investors in Xerox stock. After all, if no one's expecting much growth out of the company, then Xerox has a low hurdle to clear.It has to be easier for Xerox stock to exceed expectations for 6.7% earnings growth, after all, than it will be for Accenture to deliver better than 11.4% growth. (And with sales growth alone having averaged 5.4% annually over the past five years, there's every reason to believe Xerox can at least hit its targets going forward).Xerox stock pays you bestPerhaps most important to investors, though, is the simple fact that out of the three big IT companies discussed here, Xerox is the one generating the most cash from its business -- and it gives you the biggest free cash flow bang for your buck.Measured by dividing a company's market capitalization (the price you pay for Xerox stock) into its free cash flow (the money your investment generates for you), Xerox offers investors easily the best ""free cash flow yield"" of the three companies named. Put even more simply, for every $1 you invest in a share of Xerox stock today, you can expect the company to generate nearly 17.4 cents worth of real, cash profits on your investment.XRX FREE CASH FLOW YIELD DATA BY YCHARTSXerox may ultimately use this cash to pay you bigger dividends (although its 2.6% dividend is already pretty big), to buy back shares (increasing the size of your stake in the company for every share it takes off the table), or to reinvest in its business and maintain its lead over rivals for years to come. Any way you look at it, though, Xerox's ability to generate cash offers investors a great reason to invest.And that, Fools, is the reason I think now's a great time to buy Xerox stock."
How Innovation Affects Your Company's Stock Price,"Apr 29, 2013 at 1:05PM","Companies earn their revenue from selling innovative products and services. That's one big reason investors from Kenneth Fisher to Michael Murphy have long touted the importance of following a company's research and development expenditures. But does this mean that greater R&D spending will lead to a greater stock market return? In the following video, Fool contributor Kevin Chen finds that there may be an upward trend between the two.Analyzing IBM (NYSE:IBM), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Kevin calculates the return on research capital, or RORC. You can calculate this number yourself by taking this year's gross profit and dividing it by last year's R&D expenditures.After charting the RORC against each stocks' price change over the past few years, it becomes apparent that greater R&D expenditures may increase the stock's price return. However, there is one huge caveat. To learn more about the RORC and how to better think about your company's R&D investments, watch the video below.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

What Makes Teradata One of America's Best Companies,"Feb 27, 2013 at 11:44AM","Founded out of Caltech in 1979 by a team of researchers, Teradata (NYSE:TDC) is best known for helping Wal-Mart analyze its business on a mass scale by deploying the world's first 1 terabyte ""data warehouse"" in 1992. Today, the company partners with top tier consulting firms such as Computer Sciences, IBM, and Wipro, among others, in order to serve a vast and growing base of information-starved clients.A data warehouse is a lot like it sounds: Gather up bits of information from across a network of different sources into a digital storage facility for later analysis. Marketing data sits next to customer data, which sits next to finance data, and so on. Think of it as a personal Internet from which business intelligence and analytics tools draw insight.Teradata generates revenue from a combination of software and services, with maintenance contracts accounting for slightly more than 50% of revenue in most quarters. Sales of data warehousing technology comprises a substantial portion of the haul, of course.But as more companies become interested in analyzing patterns in their businesses, Teradata has also taken to selling more tools -- including the algorithmically astute Aster Data, which handles unstructured information such as documents. Teradata acquired Aster in 2011 after taking a partial stake earlier. Combining traditional data warehousing with advanced tools for analysis has kicked up growth in recent years.The case for TeradataGiven its fairly lengthy history, you wouldn't necessarily think of Teradata as home to cutting-edge technology. And yet it is. Employees laud Teradata's friendly and helpful teammates, excellent work-life balance, and professional growth opportunities. Not bad for a 33-year-old tech company that hasn't enjoyed much independence since its early days, especially when you consider that the employee rolls have ballooned by 50% over the past five years.And yet Teradata could do better. In an industry that offers rich benefits and sometimes even unlimited vacation time, the company pays 2% below market  on average, according to PayScale. What's more, those who rate the company highly tend to cite job security and management talent rather than compensation and benefits.Teradata went public in 1987 -- a year after Fortune named its signature technology ""Product of the Year"" -- only to be acquired by NCR (NYSE:NCR) in December 1991. The company would remain a division of NCR for the next 16 years, three of those under the leadership of current Oracle co-president Mark Hurd. Throughout, Teradata would compete with Silicon Valley rivals from the dingy confines of Dayton, Ohio.NCR granted Teradata its independence 20 years after its IPO, in 2007, and customers have come knocking in increasing numbers since. Not only is Wal-Mart still a client, but 25 organizations including Apple, Dell, and Verizon now trust more than a petabyte -- equal to 1 million gigabytes -- of sensitive corporate data to Teradata systems.More than 1,300 clients use the software in some form today. What's that mean practically? Under Koehler's leadership, Teradata has grown revenue 9% annually and profit per share by more than twice that over the past five years. Gross margin -- at 56.2% -- is as high it's been since the company returned to the public markets as an independent entity. Returns on capital have declined over the same period but remain strong at 19.8% over the trailing 12 months.Shareholders have enjoyed the performance. Shares of Teradata have more than doubled since coming public, a period during which the S&P 500 fell about 2%. The stock has also dramatically outperformed those of its closest peers: IBM, Oracle, and SAP.Corporate performance isn't the only area where Teradata stands out. More than any of its peers -- or, frankly, the vast majority of publicly traded entities -- the company takes its role as a steward seriously.The company has implemented a variety of energy-saving techniques that have allowed it to dramatically reduce its energy and emissions intensity. Employees are granted four working days per year for giving back, and so far, more than 2,300 have participated. The 2011 ""Teradata Cares"" awards singled out workers who helped with wildfire relief in Texas and education for underprivileged children in India, among other things. Teradata added to these efforts with undisclosed financial gifts.The Foolish bottom lineTeradata's combination of strong positioning, proven business performance, employee satisfaction, and enduring commitment to the wider world affirm Teradata as one of America's best businesses.Click here to read about the rest of The 25 Best Companies in America.10 stocks we like better than TeradataWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"How Apple, Smartphones, and Tablets Are Killing Sony","Mar 10, 2013 at 8:35PM","There has never been a technology that took over our lives like smartphones. After IBM released its first PC in 1981, it took nearly 20 years before 100 million PCs were sold a year. We're now closing in on six years since the first iPhone's launch, and more than 200 million smartphones were shipped last quarter alone. Hot on the heels behind smartphones are tablets, which look poised to overtake PC sales themselves within the next three years.   If the PC was like vines slowly overgrowing the technology space, then the smartphone and tablet have been wildfire, moving fast and destroying everything in their path.While the media has focused on how mobile products -- both smartphones and tablets -- threaten PC-dependent companies such as Microsoft and Dell, those companies are just a small part of a storyline in which all consumer electronics-spending is being shaken up. The truth is, the damage mobile spending is doing to Microsoft is nothing compared with how the trend is ravaging Sony (NYSE:SNE). Even worse, the reality is that we're now ending a first phase of the mobile transition, and the next phase could be even more damaging to the company and its peers. Let's take a look at Sony, and why the future is about to get a lot more dangerous. Sony: It's really just a bankIt's nearly impossible to avoid Sony. With its TVs, video-game systems, movie studio, and record label, the company is a dominant media force. Yet if you think Sony is primarily a consumer electronics and media company, you're wrong. Shockingly, almost all of Sony's profits come not from home electronics, but instead from its financial services segment. Yes, Sony has become really just a life insurance company. Just look at how things shake out at the company.Segment Operating Profit (Millions of U.S. Dollars) Sales (Millions of U.S. Dollars)Financial Services (Life Insurance, Banking) $1,595 $10,590Music (Sony Music) $448 $5,373Movie (Sony/Columbia Pictures) $414 $7,981Game (PlayStation) $356 $9,768Imaging (Cameras) $226 $9,238Mobile Products (Cell Phones) $88 $7,556Devices (Components and Chemicals) ($269) $12,456Home Entertainment and Sound (TVs, AV Equipment)  ($2,466) $15,570SOURCE: S&P CAPITAL IQ. FIGURES ARE FROM THE TRAILING 12 MONTHS OF OPERATIONS.Sony is an absolute force in most these segments. In music, it's the second largest record label, while its movie studio's films raked in $1.8 billion in the U.S. last year, enough to beat Time Warner and Disney to make Sony the highest-grossing studio. Finally, its PlayStation line-up sold more than six times the next closest video game console early last decade during the reign of the PlayStation 2. While Sony has seen less success with the PlayStation 3, it's still a dominant player in video games. Yet the one thing most consumers had no idea Sony was involved in -- life insurance and banking -- is literally more profitable than its video games, cameras, music label, and movie studio, combined. Apple: 628 times more mobile profits than SonyWhile Sony's banking arm churns out most of the company's profits, most of its sales and infrastructure lay in other units. Two of the most deeply ailing are its mobile-products and home-entertainment division. Mobile products is slightly profitable before taxes. However, its $88 million in pre-tax operating profit is laughable when stacked up to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) $55.2 billion in profit during the same period that's driven largely from the iPhone. For those of you who like really big numbers, Apple's operating profit is 628 times larger than Sony's mobile profit. The irrelevance of Sony's mobile division extends beyond the results of that segment itself. iPads sell for a higher cost than many large televisions. Sony's digital camera sales are off as smartphones increasingly become the point-and-click camera of choice. Blu-ray has never taken off the way DVD sales did last decade as consumers use tablets to buy digital media, or increasingly stream it from services like Netflix. Sony is at the mercy of all these changes, and its mobile unit isn't relevant enough to offset its losses elsewhere. Buy a smartphone, not a camera. A tablet, not a TV.The problem is that while consumer spending isn't a zero-sum game, it's close. In 2012, the industry was worse than a zero-sum game, with total spending falling. In 2013, consumer technology spending is supposed to bounce back. However, even optimistic projections expect growth to be in the low single digits this year. If consumers spend their money on a tablet, that doesn't mean they're expanding their electronics spending. It means they're forgoing another purchase like a new TV. The trend is most starkly evidenced by data from market researcher NPD. Out of the five largest spending categories on consumer electronics, everything is shrinking except smartphones and tablets. Category 2011 Sales Growth 2012 Sales GrowthTablets 135% 42%Smartphones 28% 25%Flat-Panel TVs (5%) (7%)Notebook Computers (2%) (9%)Desktop Computers 9% (11%)SOURCE: NPD RESEARCH. RESULTS ARE FOR U.S. SPENDING. Beyond these main categories, the pain extends to other areas of spending where Sony has a big presence. Video-game sales decreased 9% to $14.8 billion. Sony's camera sales are off 17% in the past 12 months. The Swiss Army knife of technologyOne of the great disruption points of smartphones and tablets is what Swiss Army knives they are. Take for example, calculators. With smartphones coming with built-in calculators and advanced ones available for download from Apps stores for low-fees, the market for standalone calculators still exists, but it's been thinned down to students and more demanding professionals. That situation is not too dissimilar from cameras, video games, or physical media. It's not that if you go to Best Buy that you won't still see Sony Blu-ray players, cameras, and PlayStations moving off the shelves. Instead, it's that a reasonable percentage of consumers are using mobile devices like smartphones and tablets instead of dedicated separate consumer electronics. Previously, if you wanted a video camera, your only option was paying a few hundred dollars for a standalone unit. Perhaps 75% of consumers were happy happy enough to do so. However, if 25% find a smartphone's built-in video camera capable enough to forgo a purchase of a standalone camera, that devastates the industry. Go back and look at Sony's camera division, and you'll find operating margins of an anemic 2.5%. For comparison, Wal-Mart, a company synonymous with taking every measure to sell items cheaply and undercut competitors, has operating margins of 5.9%, a level double Sony's camera division. Even its vaunted video-game division had operating margins of 3.6% last quarter, below Wal-Mart. Its sales were off 6% from last year, and research shows the U.S. gaming population dropped 5% last year. Video games aren't dying; the economics are just being chipped away, with the minority of gamers who are content with games on their phone shifting away from console games. The point here is that Sony specializes in hardware to meet many different markets. Yet increasingly, a percentage of users is shifting from specialized hardware to handle functions like taking pictures to letting an all-in-one device like iPhones with specialized software handle their electronics needs. Borders didn't die because everyone stopped buying books. It died because one year 11% fewer people bought books. Then the next year 14% fewer people bought books. Then finally in its last year, 16% fewer people bought books, and it couldn't adjust its cost structure fast enough to handle the changes.Sony cut 10,000 jobs last year to address the changing state of consumer-electronics spending. Yet even that massive lay-off number was just 6% of its workforce.  It gets worseThe problem for Sony is that so far, smartphones and tablets have merely shifted consumer spending. In the next phase, they could define it. Take, for example, Sonos, a wireless system. It's proved to be an extremely popular product, as different music can be streamed wirelessly and controlled to each room in the house. Yet the beauty of Sonos is in its simplicity and software. There's no litany of audio jacks on the back since music is streamed wirelessly. Well-developed software controls the music's flow through the house. Finally, the software runs on either Apple's iOS platform or Google's Android. Sonos not only kills the kind of home-theater experience that Sony is used to, but it also entrenches home electronics as vassals to platforms like Android and iOS. Therein lies the problem for Sony. The next generation of electronics is increasingly defined by its ability to tie into a platform. Sony uses Android, but it owns no dominant platforms of its own. If next-generation home-theater systems focus on simplicity and tie-ins to great software, where does that leave Sony? In the past, the company has been crippled in the software arena. It tried to make competitive software offerings, but it has all too often been crippled by making concessions to its media divisions. Later, true disruptors like iTunes arrived. A battle it can't winSony's other segments, like movies and music and, well, life insurance, are doing well. They're just not doing well enough to make up for how terribly its home-electronics and other businesses are doing. There will always be a market for high-quality video games. There will always be a market for high-end SLRs that professionals rely on. Televisions will need speakers. There will be companies that survive these shifts and manage to thrive in a smaller, more niche market of tomorrow. Yet there may not be a need for a huge sprawling corporation like Sony, with its lack of focus on any one niche area and huge corporate expense structure to control them. Five years ago, Sony was one of the most impressive technology companies on Earth. Today, it's a life insurance company. In five years, it could be gone. Major technology shifts occur rapidly, and as we've seen in past ones, even some of the world's largest companies on the wrong side can falter. Technology moves fast. Giant, sprawling businesses, all too often, don't.10 stocks we like better than SonyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why AT&T Isn't a Tech Company,"Jan 14, 2013 at 11:30AM","On this day in economic and financial history...The suit that shaped the computer revolutionAT&T (NYSE:T) is no stranger to antitrust suits. The telecom leader battled the government three times in the 20th century, and each time the result had a lasting impact on the business and technological landscape. The Department of Justice filed a suit on Jan. 14, 1949 that proved unsuccessful in its attempt to break AT&T's telecom monopoly but nevertheless changed both the telecom industry and the infant computer industry.The suit sought to separate AT&T from Western Electric, a manufacturing subsidiary AT&T had picked up as part of the spoils from its early patent battles with Western Union (NYSE:WU). Western Electric had grown into a significant part of AT&T's business model, enabling vertical integration from the phones on customers' tables to the wires that carried their signals to the switchboards at AT&T's central offices. AT&T used its dominance of the nation's telephone system to establish a leasing system, under which phone customers had to pay fees one way or the other simply to have a phone -- a relationship more oppressive than that between today's mobile customers and their carriers. Western Electric's research arm was also behind a number of Bell System innovations, including the vacuum tube, the loudspeaker, ""talkie"" films, and early mobile communications. Western Electric's research success resulted in a number of valuable patents, which the company wielded against its competitors at every opportunity.It was the vacuum tube that most profoundly influenced the ""Final Judgment"" in the case, which was delivered in 1956 as a consent decree. The suit had been focused more on AT&T's domination of a vacuum-tube computer industry than on its iron grip on the nation's phone network. The government's attitude softened somewhat between 1949 and 1956, and AT&T was allowed to maintain its regulated telecom service and its Western Electric subsidiary, but it was barred from extending itself into the computer industry or into international markets. AT&T was also forced to be more generous in its patent licensing. This ruling benefited IBM (NYSE:IBM), which was already establishing itself as a leader in the nascent computer industry -- especially considering that AT&T's Bell Labs had invented the transistor two years prior to the government's suit.Western Electric remained an important development and manufacturing arm for AT&T well past the 1984 Bell System divestiture. The subsidiary was reorganized, together with Bell Labs and American Bell, into AT&T Technologies, and it remained part of AT&T until 1996, when it was spun off as Lucent. A decade later, after persistent financial woes, Lucent became Alcatel-Lucent (NYSE:ALU) when it merged with French-based Alcatel.The consent decree had one other notable impact, according to Ars Technica writer Matthew Lasar. The creation and distribution of Unix might have not occurred without the Department of Justice's demand that AT&T stay out of the computer industry. Thanks to AT&T's openness during Unix's early development, it is today one of the most influential operating systems ever created. Both the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) OS X and iOS operating systems are Unix-based, and Linux is a Unix derivative that forms the foundation of Google's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android platform.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip. Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner and his brother, Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner, just revealed two brand new stock recommendations. Together, they've tripled the stock market's return over the last 13 years.* And while timing isn't everything, the history of Tom and David's stock picks shows that it pays to get in early on their ideas.Click here to be among the first people to hear about David and Tom's newest stock recommendations.*Stock Advisor returns as of April 2, 2018The Big Three plus oneThe Big Three became the Big Four on Jan. 14, 1954 when two former Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) components merged to become American Motors. Shareholders of Nash-Kelvinator, which had been a Dow component as Nash Motors in the 1920s and '30s, and Hudson Motors, a one-time addition in 1930, approved a merger that day to create the fourth-largest American automaker behind General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford (NYSE:F), and Chrysler. It was the largest corporate merger in American history up to that point, with the combined entity boasting a valuation of nearly $200 million.The two companies were among the oldest automakers remaining following a decades-long shakeout spurred by Ford's implementation of the assembly line: Nash had its origins in 1902, and Hudson traced its history to 1909. At this point, only Packard and Studebaker remained among the smaller automakers, and neither lasted much longer. Packard purchased Studebaker later that same year, but the smaller company's financial difficulty led to the company's failure by in the mid-1960s.Nash chairman and president George W. Mason retained these roles in the combined company, but he would not make it through AMC's first year. Mason died in the fall of 1954, and George Romney, his protege, took over these roles. The Nash and Hudson brands were soon phased out, and AMC began to produce marquees under its own name. Romney successfully fended off a takeover attempt in 1957, and the combination of star power both within and outside the industry and his impeccable stewardship of the company helped the company gain significant market share as it headed into the 1960s. Romney would resign in 1962 to capitalize on his high visibility and positive public image to enter and win the race for governor of Michigan that year.This was also near the height of AMC's strength. Although Romney had built the company's reputation on efficiency, rather than the rumbling power that typified postwar vehicles, AMC was always at a significant disadvantage in development programs to the Big Three, and it could not adapt as easily due to its smaller size. This left AMC vulnerable to the 1973 oil crisis, which forced the Big Three to pour more resources into efficient vehicles. By the mid-1970s, AMC had resumed its pre-Romney, money-losing ways, despite picking up Jeep and its lucrative government contracts in 1970. By the early 1980s AMC was primarily owned by Renault, but government pressure and poor public relations pushed Renault's executives to sell AMC to Chrysler in 1987, at which point it became Chrysler's Jeep-Eagle division.Today, AMC is primarily responsible for three things: the continuing popularity of the Jeep brand, a management mindset that has caused as many problems as it has solved for American automakers, and the political rise of Mitt Romney.Mining for long-term wealthOn Jan. 14, 1946, the industrial concern known as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing graduated from over-the-counter trading and began life as a member of the New York Stock Exchange (UNKNOWN:NYX.DL). That company officially adopted its longtime nickname when it changed its name to 3M (NYSE:MMM) in 2002.By the time of its debut, 3M was already a well-established manufacturer of diverse products, including high-quality sandpapers, Scotch tape, and other useful things for industrious types. Within two years, 3M was generating $100 million in sales, which would be nearly a billion dollars when adjusted for inflation. The Dow, recognizing 3M's consistent growth and its usefulness as a representative of the American economy, made the company one of its 30 components three decades after its debut on the NYSE. In the six decades that have followed its debut, 3M's sales have grown at an annualized rate of 9.7% -- or 5.6% if beginning with the inflation-adjusted figure."
Can Buffett's Baby Crawl Above Its 52-Week High?,"Jan 22, 2013 at 1:00PM","The A class shares of rock star investor Warren Buffett's vehicle Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) reached a 52-week high on Friday. Let's take a look at how it got here to find out if the famed company's stock price can grow even higher.How it got hereBuffett is celebrated and followed because he regularly beats the market. So it stands to reason that when the Dow advances, Berkshire Hathaway's stock price not only gains too, it trumps the index. Take any time frame you'd like -- Buffet's child will almost always win handily against the DJIA. That applies to the short term, let's say the past three months:DATA BY YCHARTS.A slightly longer string of time, one year:DATA BY YCHARTS.Or even a full decade:DATA BY YCHARTS.Buffett, an eminently quotable guy, has been making his usual pronouncements and prognostications of late, but he hasn't said or revealed anything jolting enough to move the stock on its own. Rather, the stock price advance seems largely to be due, like the success of the firm it constitutes, to strong improvement in fundamentals over time.Berkshire Hathaway earnings saw marked gains in 3Q, the company's most recent reporting period. Net came in at $3.9 billion, a fat 72% advance over the same time frame the previous year. Zooming out by a factor of three, the same figure for 1Q-3Q last year was a little over $10 billion, or 43% better than the same period of 2011.These were on the back of across-the-board revenue growth in each of the firm's three business lines. The heart of the company is its insurance and related operations, and these beat loudly with a 15% year-on-year advance in the most recent quarter. Railroad, utilities, and energy chugged and beamed along well, growing 8%, and the take from finance was positive that quarter, at a little over $1 billion... as opposed to the $1.45 billion shortfall posted in 3Q 2011.Banking on profitsWith large-scale banks weighing in with results recently, Buffett has been hit by the spotlight, too. In mid-2011, Berkshire Hathaway took a $5 billion stake in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) . This was a classic contrarian move by the cagey investor, made at a time when the company was still flat in the mud, trying to wash away the grime of the crisis era.As so often happens, his timing was magnificent, and he got a sweet deal. On the day the buy was announced, B of A's stock price was a soggy $7.55. Now, even after the bank's market-displeasing results last week, they still trade at a nearly 50% premium.Smart Warren holds preferred shares that carry a rich 6% dividend. What's more, the buyer will probably be B of A itself -- after all, what respectable bank drawing a few percentage points on its long-term debt wants to keep forking over that high a disbursement? B of A will pay a 5% fee for the privilege of retiring those preferreds, or a cool $250 million.What's even more, Buffett also received warrants on 700 million shares of common stock, which gives him the right to buy at $7.14 per share. The math on this end of the transaction alone is grand and impressive: Assuming the current share price rises even modestly, Berkshire Hathaway stands to gross not far from $3 billion.Although this is hardly a new development, it's gotten a bit of play in the media thanks to a New Year's article in The Wall Street Journal opining that the bank would greatly benefit from grabbing back the stake.My fellow Fool John Maxfield agrees; take a gander at his read on the situation here.What's nextHistorically, January's been a good month for the Dow. If this ancient trend continues, Berkshire Hathaway should outpace the index, as ever. Investors should keep an eye not only on those developments and the B of A situation, but the state of the insurance business -- as it produced roughly two-third of the company's revenue in 3Q -- plus the performance of the firm's high-profile equity holdings in big stock market names.As of the end of that quarter, the company's top five positions in those stocks (in percentage of portfolio terms) constituted a Buffettian mix of sectors: Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Wells Fargo, IBM (NYSE:IBM), American Express, and Procter & Gamble. Only one of the five (Amex) has been beating the Dow since then, however, with Coke and IBM in negative territory . The bulk of Berkshire Hathaway consists of the firms it controls directly, not its stock positions, but it still has plenty of skin in this game, and investors will want to monitor how these shares perform.DATA BY YCHARTS.It almost goes without saying that, since they form the core of Berkshire Hathaway, it'll be crucial to watch developments in those directly held subsidies. Since they aren't publicly traded, they're a little more off-radar, but there will be enough information about them when the company as a whole reports its 4Q February 1. If that quarter is a good one, and the Dow's still rising, look for Buffett's baby to continue adding inches to its height.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

"Recession, War, and Bear Markets","Feb 25, 2013 at 9:05AM","What causes a bear market? How does it get started, and how does it end? What happens to stock fundamentals during these bearish times? There are no ironclad rules that can teach you to identify the beginning and end of bear markets to come, but there are some similarities that all bear markets share. Understanding the way bear markets work can help you become a better and more informed investor -- and if you're the inquisitive sort, you're also bound to find some interesting parallels between otherwise unrelated market cycles. History may not repeat, but it often rhymes.Here, in the second part of a three-part series, you'll find an overview of notable bear markets, from the middle of the Great Depression to the height of the Cold War, in the history of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Each bear market overview includes some basic background data, some of the market's major fundamental changes during those periods, and a brief description of the economic, social, technological, financial, and political forces at work. When you've finished reading, don't forget to check out the other parts of this series, as well as the companion series to this one that highlights the Dow's many bull markets. You can find the links below.1937-1938: Echo recessionBegan (starting price): March 10, 1937 (194.4)Ended (final price): March 31, 1938 (98.95)Number of trading days: 268Total percentage loss and average loss per trading day: 49%, 0.18% per dayVolatility (i.e., average daily price change): 1.32%CAPE, initial and final: 22 to 11.8 (47% decline)The Japanese invasion of China, combined with rising belligerence in Europe and a change in U.S. economic policy, sent the Dow into tailspin. Industrial production fell harder than it had in 1930, and steelmakers saw their output capacity plummet to just 20%. The domestic causes have been debated -- Keynesians argue that austerity measures were to blame, while monetarists and Austrians point to money-supply problems as the root issue.1938-1939: Prewar jitters (part two)Began (starting price): Nov. 9, 1938 (158.08)Ended (final price): April 11, 1939 (123.75)Number of trading days: 103Total percentage loss and average loss per trading day: 24%, 0.03% per dayVolatility: 0.94%CAPE, initial and final: 16.1 to 13.9 (14% decline)A short, relatively shallow bear market began after the Munich Agreement, which ceded the Sudetenland to Germany and resulted in the infamous ""peace for our time"" speech. Investors feared the onset of war, and they would soon be proven correct.1939-1942: World War II gloomBegan (starting price): Sept. 12, 1939 (155.92)Ended (final price): April 28, 1942 (92.92)Number of trading days: 656Total percentage loss and average loss per trading day: 40%, 0.06% per dayVolatility: 0.65%CAPE, initial and final: 16.5 to 8.5 (48% decline)This bear market began soon after the German blitz of Poland and continued until America was earnestly engaged in the war following the attack on Pearl Harbor. An initial ""war bride"" buying frenzy collapsed within days of the blitz as it became more apparent that America's allies might be overrun. A rumor that the New York Stock Exchange might close only made the situation worse. The slide continued until after America's entry to war prompted the largest industrial surge in history.1946-1949: Postwar hangoverBegan (starting price): May 29, 1946 (212.5)Ended (final price): June 13, 1949 (161.6)Number of trading days: 762Total percentage loss and average loss per trading day: 24%, 0.03% per dayVolatility: 0.59%CAPE, initial and final: 15.8 to 9.1 (43% decline)The transition from wartime production to peacetime production was even more pronounced in 1946 than it was in 1919. More importantly for stocks, millions of workers in this economy became savers, rather than investors, as many still held bad memories of the speculation preceding the Great Depression. There were only 150 investment management companies operating at the end of 1949, managing only $2.7 billion in funds. Total daily volume at 1949's lowest point was only about $540,000 -- nearly 97% lower than it had been in 1929. However, this bear market was an outlier, as corporate earnings grew more than 200% in nominal terms and more than 120% when adjusted for inflation, a higher rate by far than experienced in any other bear market.1956-1957: Red scareBegan (starting price): April 6, 1956 (521.05)Ended (final price): Oct. 22, 1957 (419.79)Number of trading days: 390Total percentage loss and average loss per trading day: 19%, 0.05% per dayVolatility: 0.53%CAPE, initial and final: 19.4 to 13.7 (29% decline)This shallow bear market is sometimes considered a mere correction. It occurred primarily in response to Communist-driven geopolitical events, particularly the launch of Sputnik and the Soviet invasion of Hungary. The Suez Canal crisis in mid-1956 also contributed to the decline.1961-1962: Steel and tech crashBegan (starting price): Nov. 15, 1961 (734.34)Ended (and final price): June 26, 1962 (535.76)Number of trading days: 154Total percentage loss and average loss per trading day: 27%, 0.18% per dayVolatility: 0.63%CAPE, initial and final: 21.9 to 17.1 (22% decline)This bear market is sometimes associated with the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis, but neither took place within this time frame. Rather, it was President John F. Kennedy's battle with U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) over its price hikes that precipitated a crash, as investors feared an antibusiness sentiment in the government. Many tech companies of the day, including IBM (NYSE:IBM), were valued at unsustainably high levels. Before the crash, IBM had a P/E of 65, and other ""Nifty 50"" tech companies were similarly valued. However, this relatively mild bear market was only a speed bump on the road to more Nifty 50 gains.1966: Credit crunchBegan (starting price): Feb. 9, 1966 (995.15)Ended (final price): Oct. 7, 1966 (744.32)Number of trading days: 168Total percentage loss and average loss per trading day: 25%, 0.15% per dayVolatility: 0.64%CAPE, initial and final: 23.7 to 18.8 (21% decline)This was the first bear market following the escalation of the Vietnam War, but investors were not yet preoccupied with it as they would be later in the decade. At the start of the year, CAPE ratios for the market were at their highest level since 1929, and the flow of investment money was drying up. Tight money led to fewer buyers, putting downward pressure on stocks despite a slowly expanding economy. A crisis of confidence hit Wall Street just as civil unrest began to simmer.Putting it all togetherMemories of the Great Crash of 1929 held much of the market's speculative tendencies in check during this period. As a result of reduced investor interest and greater investor caution -- particularly after the war -- many of the bear markets during this period were mild in terms of either total decline or their average daily declines. Politics had an especially outsize influence on the Dow during these years as a world war gave way to the Cold War and America always seemed on the brink of another great clash.Want to learn more about market cycles?

The Postwar Bull Market Boom,"Feb 25, 2013 at 9:02AM","What drives a bull market? How does it get started, and how does it end? What happens to stock fundamentals during these bullish times? There are no ironclad rules that can tell you when a bull market begins and ends, but there are some similarities that all bull markets share. Understanding the way bull markets work can help you become a better and more informed investor -- and if you're the inquisitive sort, you're also bound to find some interesting parallels between otherwise unrelated market cycles. History may not repeat, but it often rhymes.Here, in the second of a three-part series, you'll find an overview of some of the most notable Depression-era and postwar bull markets in the history of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Each bull market overview includes some basic background data, some of the market's major fundamental changes during those periods, and a brief description of the economic, social, technological, financial, and political forces at work. When you've finished reading, don't forget to check out the other parts of this series, as well as the companion series to this one that highlights the Dow's many bear markets.1932-1937: Roosevelt's reboundBegan (starting price): July 8, 1932 (41.22)Ended (final price): March 10, 1937 (194.4)Number of trading days: 1,161Total percentage gain and average gain per trading day: 372%, 0.32% per dayVolatility (i.e., average daily price change): 1.27%CAPE, initial and final: 5.8 to 22 (278% increase)This rebound began less than a week after future President Franklin D. Roosevelt's acceptance speech at the Democratic nominating convention in 1932. It was both incredibly powerful and incredibly volatile, driven in part by the Roosevelt administration's ""bold, persistent experimentation"" with both regulation and economic stimulus. It was also marred by two corrections strong enough to be termed bear markets in their own right: a 37% decline from September 1932 to February 1933 as investors awaited the Roosevelt presidency and a 22% decline from February through July of 1934.1938-1939: Roosevelt's second reboundBegan (starting price): March 31, 1938 (98.95)Ended (final price): Nov. 9, 1938 (158.08)Number of trading days: 154Total percentage gain and average gain per trading day: 60%, 0.39% per dayVolatility: 1.32%CAPE, initial and final: 11.8 to 16.1 (37% increase)The Dow shrugged off war worries and made a modest recovery from a 1937 recession within the Great Depression period. Industrial output and factory employment both increased as the government resumed its deficit spending, which it had temporarily interrupted during the bear market preceding this rebound.1939: Prewar bounceBegan (starting price): April 11, 1939 (123.75)Ended (final price): Sept. 12, 1939 (155.92)Number of trading days: 108Total percentage gain and average gain per trading day: 26%, 0.24% per dayVolatility: 1.01%CAPE, initial and final: 13.9 to 16.5 (18% increase)Most of the gains in this baby bull took place during its final week as the Dow rose from a 9% gain to its final 26% gain in the span of six trading days. This came in response to the German blitz of Poland, which triggered war-bride optimism toward industrial stocks similar to what had been seen during World War I.1942-1946: World War II boomBegan (starting price): April 28, 1942 (92.92)Ended (final price): May 29, 1946 (212.5)Number of trading days: 1,022Total percentage gain and average gain per trading day: 129%, 0.13% per dayVolatility (average daily price change): 0.49%CAPE, initial and final: 8.5 to 15.8 (85% increase)America's entry into World War II produced the most comprehensive industrial shift in history. American automakers were conscripted to build a staggering amount of war machines and materiel. Steelmakers and shipbuilders were kept going at maximum capacity. The singular focus on war production (and the conscription of millions of America's young men) brought unemployment down to negligible levels. U.S. debt to GDP reached its highest point in history as the government engaged in the largest stimulus program ever seen. There weren't a lot of investors, but those who remained were far more interested in buying, despite a 27% reduction in real corporate earnings as a consequence of widespread federal contracts, mandates, and business restrictions.1949-1956: Postwar boomBegan (starting price): June 13, 1949 (161.6)Ended (final price): April 6, 1956 (521.05)Number of trading days: 1,708Total percentage gain and average gain per trading day: 222%, 0.13% per dayVolatility: 0.48%CAPE, initial and final: 9.1 to 19.4 (114% increase)A generation's distrust of the stock market finally melted away during this period of dramatic economic expansion. The devastated European continent provided little competition, but it offered great export potential for American industrial concerns. The baby boom was kicking into full gear as the Greatest Generation formed families and entered their prime earning years. The consumer economy that took root in the Roaring '20s reached new heights as a recalibrated manufacturing sector cranked out cars and gizmos, rather than tanks and aircraft.1957-1961: Return of the retail investorBegan (and starting price): Oct. 22, 1957 (419.79)Ended (and final price): Nov. 15, 1961 (734.34)Number of trading days: 1,025Total percentage gain and average gain per trading day: 75%, 0.07% per dayVolatility: 0.51%CAPE, initial and final: 13.7 to 21.9 (59% increase)A severely weakened investment industry began its earnest recovery in the latter half of the 1950s. Over the course of this decade, employment in the securities industry doubled, investing was again heavily touted in public advertisements, and an estimated 10 million new investors rushed into the market. By the end of this bull market, $1,000 invested in U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) in 1949 had grown to $7,000, and the same amount invested at the same time in IBM (NYSE:IBM) had grown to $26,300. The massive National Interstate and Defense Highways Act became law in 1956, initiating the radical restructure of middle-class American life around the suburbs. In many ways, this was a continuation of the previous bull market, with many of the same economic forces at work.1962-1966: A New Frontier for mutual fundsBegan (starting price): June 26, 1962 (535.76)Ended (final price): Feb. 9, 1966 (995.15)Number of trading days: 914Total percentage gain and average gain per trading day: 86%, 0.09% per dayVolatility: 0.41%CAPE, initial and final: 17.1 to 23.7 (38% increase)Like the Eisenhower bull market, this bull market continued the postwar strength. Begun during President John F. Kennedy's term, it continued growing after his assassination on the back of tax cuts and the rapid expansion of the mutual-fund industry, which grew to $35 billion during this period from just $1 billion after the war. Mainframe computing companies gained prominence during this period, planting the seeds for the first computing bubble. Warren Buffett gained control of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) during this period and achieved spectacular growth at its helm during the secular bear market that began after the bull run ended.Putting it all togetherInvestors entered this period with fear and ended it in a state of rapturous bullishness. The most destructive war in world history reshaped the global map of power. America's manufacturing infrastructure reached its peak during this period, but few could have expected such an outcome in 1932. The public's attitude toward the stock market made a complete turnaround, which helped to create the modern securities and investing industries.Want to learn more?

Bear Markets in Modern Times,"Feb 25, 2013 at 9:06AM","What causes a bear market? How does it get started, and how does it end? What happens to stock fundamentals during these bearish times? There are no ironclad rules that can teach you to identify the beginning and end of bear markets to come, but there are some similarities that all bear markets share. Understanding the way bear markets work can help you become a better and more informed investor -- and if you're the inquisitive sort, you're also bound to find some interesting parallels between otherwise unrelated market cycles. History may not repeat, but it often rhymes.Here, in the last of a three-part series, you'll find an overview of notable bear markets in the recent history of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Each bear market overview includes some basic background data, some of the market's major fundamental changes during those periods, and a brief description of the economic, social, technological, financial, and political forces at work. When you've finished reading, don't forget to check out the other parts of this series, as well as the companion series to this one that highlights the Dow's many bear markets. You can find the links below.1968-1970: Vietnam jittersBegan (starting price): Nov. 29, 1968 (985.08)Ended (final price): May 26, 1970 (631.16)Number of trading days: 370Total percentage loss and average loss per trading day: 36%, 0.10% per dayVolatility (i.e., average daily price change): 0.58%CAPE, initial and final: 22.3 to 13.8 (38% decline)The escalating conflict in Vietnam caused widespread unrest and protests in the latter part of the 1960s. Inflation and the expansion of government entitlements, begun under President John F. Kennedy but greatly expanded by President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, also contributed to worries among the investor class. Interest rates rose beyond 9% by 1969 as the Federal Reserve attempted to combat inflation, further tightening the supply of credit.1973-1974: Nixon and OPEC price shocksBegan (starting price): Jan. 8, 1973 (1,047.86)Ended (final price): Dec. 6, 1974 (577.6)Number of trading days: 485Total percentage loss and average loss per trading day: 45%, 0.09% per dayVolatility: 1%CAPE, initial and final: 18.7 to 8.3 (56% decline)President Richard Nixon had taken the U.S. off the gold standard in 1971 and would resign in disgrace over the Watergate scandal by early 1974. These two events bookended the OPEC oil embargo, which sent oil prices skyrocketing to four times their 1973 levels by the time of Nixon's resignation. The dollar weakened under the weight of these crises, inflation ran at one of the highest levels of any bear market (the consumer price index increased 22% during this time), and interest rates continued their rise. The Nifty 50's growth was finally undone after a decade of largely positive momentum. IBM's (NYSE:IBM) P/E slipped from 40 to 12 by the end of this bear market.1976-1978: StagflationBegan (starting price): Sept. 21, 1976 (1,014.79)Ended (final price): Feb. 28, 1978 (742.12)Number of trading days: 363Total percentage loss and average loss per trading day: 27%, 0.07% per dayVolatility: 0.56%CAPE, initial and final: 11.3 to 9.5 (21% decline)The Carter years experienced less inflation than the post-Nixon bear market, but they also experienced flat real earnings growth -- thus, ""stagflation."" The CPI grew roughly 10% during this period, but real earnings increased just 3%. This bear market was also the first to experience what would become an ongoing and deepening trade deficit. Gold enjoyed a dramatic rise as an inflation hedge.1981-1982: Volcker crashBegan (starting price: April 24, 1981 (1,024.05)Ended (final price): Aug. 12, 1982 (776.92)Number of trading days: 329Total percentage loss and average loss per trading day: 24%, 0.07% per dayVolatility: 0.63%CAPE, initial and final: 8.8 to 6.6 (25% decline)This relatively shallow bear market resulted from the combination of a deep recession and Fed Chairman Paul Volcker's determined inflation-fighting efforts, which exacerbated the recession. An oil price shock in 1979 also had lingering effects on the American economy. Stocks began this bear market already at their lowest valuations in a generation and continued lower to a CAPE not seen since the Great Depression. The Fed's discount rate, which is the interest rate it charges banks to borrow its reserves, hit an all-time high of 14% in mid-1981 and was not lowered back into the single digits until after this bear market had bottomed out.1987: Black Monday crashBegan (starting price): Aug. 25, 1987 (2,722.42)Ended (final price): Oct. 19, 1987 (1,738.74)Number of trading days: 39Total percentage loss and average loss per trading day: 36%, 0.93% per dayVolatility: 1.7%CAPE, initial and final: 18.3 to 13.6 (26% decline)One of the most bewildering bear markets in history was also the shortest and most violent by far. Without the 23% drop on Black Monday that marked the end of this crash, it would have been a relatively minor 17% correction. It was this event that awakened investors to the new reality of computerized trading and provided market regulators the impetus to implement new mechanisms to rein in the worst automated excesses.1990: Iraq contractionBegan (starting price): Jul. 17, 1990 (2,999.75)Ended (final price): Oct. 11, 1990 (2,365.1)Number of trading days: 62Total percentage loss and average loss per trading day: 21%, 0.34% per dayVolatility: 1.05%CAPE, initial and final: 17.7 to 15.2 (14% decline)The Gulf War began midway through this bear market, sending oil prices spiking to a decade high in October of 1990. This, combined with the simmering savings and loan crisis and the decline of Japan's Nikkei index from its all-time high, produced a short, mild downturn that is sometimes termed a correction rather than a bear market.2000-2002: Dot-com crashBegan (starting price): Jan. 14, 2000 (11,722.98)Ended (final price): Oct. 9, 2002 (7,286.27)Number of trading days: 694Total percentage loss and average loss per trading day: 38%, 0.05% per dayVolatility: 1.05%CAPE, initial and final: 43.8 to 22 (50% decline)Stock valuations at the peak of the dot-com bubble were higher than at any other time in the Dow's history, driven by unchecked speculation (or ""irrational exuberance"") divorced from any due diligence or sensible expectations for the future. A number of dot-com start-ups went bankrupt within a year of going public in 1999 and early 2000, and a number of major corporate accounting scandals, particularly those of Enron and WorldCom, further shook investor confidence. The 9/11 attacks deepened a mild recession and further prolonged the slide, which became the second-longest of the postwar era. The Nasdaq (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) peaked two months after the Dow but has never recovered due to the number of worthless or drastically overpriced dot-com stocks added during the bubble. The merger of AOL and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) was this bear market's canary in the coal mine. Announced just four days before the Dow's peak, the resulting combination never lived up to its initial $350 billion price tag.2007-2009: Housing and financial crisisBegan (starting price): Oct. 9, 2007 (14,164.53)Ended (final price): March 9, 2009 (6,547.05)Number of trading days: 356Total percentage loss and average loss per trading day: 54%, 0.15% per dayVolatility: 1.51%CAPE, initial and final: 27.3 to 13.3 (51% decline)A debt-fueled housing bubble blew apart in spectacular fashion during this bear market. The proliferation of financial instruments tied to home loans proved disastrous for the global financial sector as millions of American homeowners defaulted on homes they couldn't afford. Liquidity dried up around the world, forcing central banks to take unprecedented action and compelling governments to enact enormous stimulus measures to prop up their ailing economies. This was the second-deepest and second-most-volatile (excepting 1987) bear market in the Dow's history next to the one that began the Great Depression -- a once-in-a-lifetime event for many investors.Putting it all togetherAn era that began in uncertainty soon came to be ruled by excess. Many parallels exist between the Roaring '20s and the dot-com era, including the speculative mania of bubble times and extreme corrections that followed. After enduring two deep declines, the Dow has returned to a nominal level within reach of its all-time high. Is this the start of something durable, or is there another bear market in the near future? If the 1930s are any indication, we may not be out of the woods yetWant to learn more about market cycles?

How IBM Created the Future of the PC -- and Almost Destroyed Its Own,"Aug 12, 2013 at 11:33AM","On this day in economic and business history...International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) burst into the growing personal computer field Wednesday by announcing a new system that will be sold through IBM's own stores, ComputerLand dealers, and Sears, Roebuck & Co's new Business System Centers.The IBM personal computer, designed for home, school, or small business use, will range in price from $1,565 for a basic home system attached to an audio cassette player and television system to as much as $6,300 for business systems using color graphics and printers.With its announcement, made with great fanfare at media conferences held simultaneously in Chicago and other cities, IBM presented its challenge to Apple Computer; Tandy's Radio Shack; and Commodore International. Those firms now dominate the personal computer market, which has grown to $1.5 billion in revenues since the mid-1970s.-- Chicago Tribune, ""Personal computers to join IBM lineup."" Aug. 13, 1981.IBM changed the world on Aug. 12, 1981, when it launched the 5150 personal computer. It was not the first to market -- Apple, RadioShack, and Commodore had created the first ""trinity"" of true PCs in 1977 (click the links to read more about their groundbreaking products) -- but IBM blew the doors off the competition, purely by accident. In fact, it was because IBM acted in a most un-IBM-like way that its PC became the de facto computing standard for more than three decades.The personal-computing market was already growing rapidly by 1981. Contemporary estimates showed the size of that market doubling every year since the launch of the 1977 trinity, and by the time IBM was ready to hit the market, approximately 80,000 computers were shipped each month, resulting in monthly revenue of about $250 million. Every month that IBM waited would see it fall further behind in an exploding market.The company could have developed proprietary components and built its PC from the ground up, as its competitors had, but that might have taken years. When IBM executives reached out to Bill Lowe, the director of IBM's General Systems Division lab in Boca Raton, Fla., to develop a personal computer, they granted him and his team wide latitude for the sake of development speed. As a result, the Boca Raton team did something IBM had never done before in developing a new system: They used other companies' parts. IBM's history describes this fast-paced environment:The manufacturing strategy was to simplify everything, devise a sound plan and not deviate. There was not time to develop and test all components. So they shopped for completely functioning and pretested subassemblies, put them together and tested the final product. Zero defects was part of the plan.In sum, the development team broke all the rules. They went outside the traditional boundaries of product development within IBM. They went to outside vendors for most of the parts, went to outside software developers for the operating system and application software, and acted as an independent business unit. Those tactics enabled them to develop and announce the IBM PC in 12 months -- at that time faster than any other hardware product in IBM's history.At a press conference at the Waldorf Astoria ballroom in New York City, [PC project lead Don] Estridge announced the IBM Personal Computer with a price tag of $1,565. Two decades earlier, an IBM computer often cost as much as $9 million and required an air-conditioned quarter-acre of space and a staff of 60 people to keep it fully loaded with instructions. The new IBM PC could not only process information faster than those earlier machines but it could hook up to the home TV set, play games, process text and harbor more words than a fat cookbook.IBM sold 100,000 5150 PCs by Christmas of 1981. It did not immediately become the best-selling machine on the market -- the Commodore 64 held that title until IBM-based PCs took the lead in 1985 -- but it set in motion a sea change in the computing industry that would eventually push two of the 5150's component suppliers to all-time market-cap records. Because the IBM PC's core components were supplied by other companies, all it took was a ""clean room"" reverse engineering of the IBM PC's basic input/output system for other manufacturers to figure out how to build copycat machines without running afoul of any IBM copyrights.Columbia Data Products launched first IBM PC clone less than one year later after taking the 5150 through the clean-room reverse-engineering process. This clone retained the two most important parts of the original 5150: the Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) 8088 microprocessor and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) MS-DOS operating system. Wintel was thus allowed to spread beyond IBM's control, and before long there were a wide array of IBM-compatible PCs on the market. The first ""portable"" IBM PC, the Compaq Portable, launched shortly after Columbia's clone, and by the mid-'80s, Compaq and other low-cost manufacturers had begun to push the PC standard forward with the use of better Intel chips and more advanced Microsoft operating systems.By the late 1980s, IBM had effectively lost control of the technical standard it had created. Its effort to build a proprietary operating system (with Microsoft's help) fell flat, and Windows took off shortly thereafter. The spread of commoditized PCs was an incredible boon to Intel and Microsoft, as both companies retained full control over the pricing of the PC's two most essential components. However, IBM was floundering. The venerable tech company reported a $5 billion annual loss for the 1992 fiscal year, a record for U.S. corporations, despite holding the lead in global PC market share. PCs had become a commodity, and IBM couldn't keep cutting its prices.The decision to use off-the-shelf components had far-reaching effects on the business world. PCs would almost certainly have continued to spread without IBM, but the computers that would have spread in the 5150's absence would have looked and worked differently. Instead of establishing IBM at the head of the computing pack, the PC eventually produced market caps in excess of $500 billion for both Microsoft and Intel, while IBM sought buyers for its distressed PC manufacturing operations. After IBM lost the market-share lead in the 1990s, Hewlett-Packard eventually stepped up in its stead, particularly after it merged with PC clone pioneer Compaq in 2002.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) recognized Microsoft and Intel's importance to the PC era in 1999, two years after it added HP to its roster. No other easily identifiable product can claim as much responsibility for the success of so many Dow components as the IBM 5150. Unfortunately, these companies' continued reliance on the PC industry in a post-PC era might make them the PC's next wave of victims, as well.10 better buys than the Dow Jones Industrial AverageWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

How Dividends Change the Game for Faithful IBM Investors,"Nov 11, 2013 at 2:03PM","The wealth-building power of compound interest will never cease to amaze me.It's a story of patience and attention to detail, where small short-term differences add up to massive divergence over decades. And in the end, the biggest winners don't always deliver the fattest share-price returns.Today, I'll take another look at Dow Jones (DJINDICES:^DJI) bellwether IBM (NYSE:IBM). It's been about six months since I last dove into IBM's dividend and buyback policies, and things have changed dramatically since then. This is a very unusual picture for IBM investors:IBM DATA BY YCHARTS.The Big Blue stock has underperformed its Dow Jones peers dramatically over the last two quarters. IBM has missed earnings estimates, discussed dramatic strategy shifts, and generally not acted like the rock-steady blue-chip company investors had come to know. All of these rare headwinds have damaged IBM's stock returns. But that's not always a disaster for long-term investors.Low share prices have a couple of upsides, too. For one, IBM's 2.1% dividend yield offers payouts not seen since the height of the 2008-2009 financial crisis:IBM DIVIDEND YIELD (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.For another, IBM keeps buying back shares at a breakneck pace, and it added another $15 billion to its repurchasing plans only two weeks ago. That's a fantastic way to return value to shareholders when share prices are running low. You get so much more bang for your buyback buck when you're trading 15% below 52-week highs.The same theory also applies to regular investors, especially those with an active DRIP plan or some other automatic dividend-reinvestment strategy. Again, you simply get more IBM shares for your dividend check when stock prices are falling.All of these theoretical upsides are null and void if IBM never returns to its characteristic long-term price gains, of course. If the business is falling apart, it doesn't really matter how cheaply you can buy the stock, or how rich the dividend yield may look in the short term.But that's hardly the case here. Remember the strategy shift we talked about earlier? IBM is adapting to a changing market by stepping away from the one-stop shop business model and focusing on high-growth opportunities like cloud computing and smart infrastructure installations.IBM has been around for more than a century, and this isn't the company's first drastic market shift. There are always uncharted waters to map out, but few companies are better-equipped to get it done than this surprisingly nimble veteran.Warren Buffett believes in IBM -- so much that he invested nearly $11 billion in the company. If Buffett feels this strongly about a technology stock, it's almost foolhardy to bet against him.

Following Warren Buffett Into IBM Could Be a Great Strategy,"Oct 22, 2013 at 7:00PM","Legendary investor Warren Buffett began buying shares of technology giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) in early 2011 due its impressive turnaround under former CEOs Lou Gerstner and Sam Palmisano. Buffett also heralded the company's smart financial management, which has generated additional value for shareholders.Indeed, IBM is now the third-largest holding for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B). However, so far the investment has underperformed. While the market has been rising since Buffett began buying, IBM shares recently dropped below the average price he paid, following IBM's disappointing Q3 earnings report.WARREN BUFFETT SPEAKS TO REPORTERS.This has given investors a rare opportunity to follow Berkshire Hathaway into a major investment without paying a premium to what Buffett paid. This seems like a smart strategy. While IBM has hit some bumps recently, the company has a strong franchise and there are good reasons to expect fairly swift improvement. This creates a very favorable risk/reward trade-off today.Rare declineThe recent earnings-driven drop in IBM's stock price has left the stock nearly 20% below the all-time high it set earlier this year. Up until now, IBM has generated extremely consistent share price appreciation since closing the sale of its PC unit to Lenovo in 2005.IBM 10 YEAR STOCK CHART. DATA BY YCHARTS.Aside from a roughly 40% drop in 2008 due to the Great Recession, IBM shares have not experienced a 20% decline since 2005. In other words, IBM is a business that has historically been a reliable performer. If IBM's weaker-than-expected results are a sign of secular decline, then the stock could be in for continued trouble, but otherwise the recent price drop represents an historic opportunity.IBM can bounce backFortunately, IBM's recent struggles are unlikely to continue. While revenue declined 4% year-over-year, half of that decline was attributable to currency fluctuations. Management blamed most of the remaining shortfall on delayed hardware purchases in China, where public sector spending has ground to a halt in anticipation of new economic reforms that could be announced as early as next month.The bottom line for investors is that IBM expects both of these factors to diminish over the next two quarters and then turn into a tailwind thereafter. IBM also experienced weak growth in software last quarter, but management expects a strong rebound in the current quarter. As a result, executives repeatedly affirmed during IBM's earnings call that IBM is on track to meet is long-term guidance, which calls for EPS of $20 by 2015.One key data point supporting that forecast is that IBM's services backlog continues to grow. It reached $141 billion at the end of last quarter, up 2% in dollar terms and up 6% in constant currency. This is a sure sign that IBM's largest business unit (accounting for more than half of company revenue) will return to growth soon.Foolish conclusionIBM may have dragged down Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio last week, but don't expect Warren Buffett to sell. In fact, he's more likely to take advantage of the ""fire sale"" at IBM to scoop up even more stock.IBM stock is particularly attractive because while the market's earnings multiple continues to expand, IBM now trades for less than 10 times expected 2014 earnings. The company's recent stumble does not seem to be indicative of long-term decline. Meanwhile, IBM has been consistently repurchasing more than $10 billion of stock each year, thus building shareholder value.As a result, I think IBM will be a long-term winner for Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. Best of all, individual investors now have a chance to buy IBM at the same price Buffett paid back in 2011 and share in Buffett's future gains.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"How Falling Server Sales Affect HP, IBM, and Intel","Dec 10, 2013 at 3:00PM","With the growth of cloud computing, the traditional server market has lost its cash cow status for many companies. IDC estimates that server sales fell by 3.7% year-over-year in the third quarter, thanks largely to big web companies designing their own servers and having them built by contract manufacturers. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), the top two server manufacturers, have seen margins decline due to this trend, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the dominant server chip provider, has had to adapt to this changing market.Proprietary no moreIn the old days, companies simply bought servers from companies like HP, IBM, and Dell, and those providers were able to achieve solid margins in the server business. But, as cloud computing has taken off, with the so-called ""big four"" cloud companies -- Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft -- rapidly growing their capacity, server companies are increasingly being cut out of the loop. These cloud companies are designing their own servers, buying chips directly from Intel, then farming manufacturing off to Asia.Four years ago, 75% of Intel's server chip revenue came from Dell, HP, and IBM. Today, that same 75% is split between eight companies, one of which is Google. It's clear that the market has already shifted dramatically, and Intel has a dedicated salesperson for each of these big cloud customers. Small companies that don't need a huge number of servers and don't want to trust their data to a public cloud will likely remain customers of HP, IBM, and Dell, but the proprietary server business is certainly shrinking.What this means for HPThe No. 1 server vendor, HP, stands to lose the most from these trends. The company derives a significant portion of its profits from server sales, and although HP picked up share in Q3, operating margin continued to decline. The slight increase in revenue from this gain in share likely means nothing long-term, and I see no reason to believe that the server profits will stabilize any time soon.HP's enterprise group, which is responsible for servers, accounted for 45% of the company's fiscal 2013 non-GAAP operating profit. Operating margin, which sat near 19% in Q4 of 2011, has fallen to 14.5% in Q4 of 2013. What's worse, HP has no other businesses that can make up for these falling profits. Companywide, revenue and profits are declining in almost every division. As server profits slowly dry up, it's hard to imagine where growth is supposed to come from.What this means for IBMThe No. 2 server vendor is IBM, a company which sells servers based on both the x86 architecture from Intel and its own Power architecture. IBM's server sales collapsed last quarter, likely allowing HP to pick up share, but IBM has a robust, highly profitable business without relying on hardware sales.Last quarter, IBM had a service backlog of $141 billion, up 6% year-over-year. The company is constantly shifting out of low-margin businesses to focus on high-margin opportunities, and it has become very good at maximizing and growing profits. The IBM of today looks very different from the IBM of 2000, as can be seen from the graphic below.Pre-tax income by segmentSource: IBM Investor RelationsHardware has become decreasingly important to IBM, and today the company can easily absorb hardware weakness without significantly affecting the bottom line. While HP is in big trouble due to the shift to the cloud, IBM should be perfectly fine.What this means for IntelSales of x86 servers actually grew by 2.8% in the third quarter, as the big cloud companies design their servers around Intel chips. The vast increase in demand for servers from these companies is clearly a positive for Intel. However, the company has had to accept lower margins as the big cloud companies typically use cheaper, lower-margin CPUs than typical enterprise customers.This margin sacrifice is necessary in order to keep AMD and ARM-based chips from gaining any significant server market share. Intel's data center group is a bright spot for the company, and Intel expects revenue to grow by 15% annually in the long-term. This likely hinges on the company's chips powering the growing data centers of the big cloud companies, and Intel is making sure that happens. The CPU is one area that companies can't really skimp on, and Intel offers superior performance-per-watt compared to the alternatives.The bottom lineMuch like the PC market, the server market is becoming one where the companies that actually manufacture the servers make very little money, while Intel manages hefty margins. Given HP's reliance on server profits, I don't see a path to growth for the company any time soon. IBM's shift away from hardware is serving it well, and a declining hardware business means little for its bottom line. Intel has serious competitive advantages in the server chip business, and those should allow the company to continue to dominate the industry.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

5 Companies With Epic Stories About Getting Fired,"Nov 16, 2013 at 11:00AM","One of the most famous firings of all time actually inspired the term ""firing.""It happened in the early 1900s when John Patterson, the eccentric founder of the National Cash Register Company (NCR (NYSE:NCR)(NYSE:NCR)), was so displeased with a sales executive that he had the employee's desk and chair removed to the company's grounds. Right before the employee returned from a sales call, the whole pile was set on fire.This hapless salesman wasn't the only employee Patterson fired. Fully one-sixth of NCR executives were dismissed between 1910 and 1930 for infractions as grievous as using butter or pepper (Patterson was fanatic about fitness) or falling off a horse during mandatory equestrian trots.The words of wisdom he imparted to his fired minions were equally brutal. His ""goodbye"" went like this: ""There are just two things. Everything you say is wrong. Everything you do is wrong.""The best revenge for being fired...It was Patterson's firing of another executive that made business history, however.Once again Patterson had the man's desk put out on the lawn. But the salesman, Thomas Watson -- took his firing in stride and his resume right over to a small NCR competitor called Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company.Watson would stay there for the next forty years where, under his leadership, CTR became one of the most successful American companies ever -- IBM (NYSE:IBM).Another corporate mis-fireOne of the most infamous firings was carried out by onetime Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO John Sculley who ousted the man who hired him -- company co-founder Steve Jobs. (Sculley claims he ""demoted"" Jobs. Jobs always insisted he was fired.) )The upshot? Sculley became a footnote in Apple's corporate history, himself fired after ten years, and Jobs will forever be the man who not only saved his own company, but changed the way the human race interacts with technology.Sometimes companies try to ease fired employees out the door with a little more care. But, even then, there's plenty that can backfire.When Northwest Airlines fired hundreds of workers in 2006 it sent them off with a helpful brochure of 101 tips, including holding garage sales and dumpster diving (tip No. 46) to tide them over during the rough patch without paychecks.That may seem almost benevolent now when employees are fired via text, FedEx, email, Post-its, voice mail, fax, Facebook, and auto-correct. (So far Pinterest firing seems to be virgin territory.)source:http://www.buzzfeed.com/tabathaleggett/brutal-firedEven CEOs aren't immune to these callous ways of letting someone go. Former Yahoo! CEO Carol Bartz was fired by phone in 2011.And in this age of electronic means of surveillance at every corner, woe is the company who finds its personal employee dealings aired to the entire world.This August, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong fired an employee for taking a photo during an all-hands employee meeting/conference call. Unfortunately for all involved, the meeting was being recorded. The audio of the firing went viral, and what would have been a small news item on the feeds became fodder for water coolers everywhere.There is a ""right"" way to fire someoneThere are some things about getting fired that are going to be unpleasant, no matter what -- there's no way to put a happy face on the ""walk of shame"" of carrying a box of belongings while being frogmarched out by security.According to HR expert Susan M. Heathfield there is only one right way to fire someone: Face-to-face. (Firing someone via any other means of communication is the No. 1 item on her list of 10 ""don'ts"" when it comes to firing.)""Laying off employees by remote indicates a very low emotional intelligence on the part of management,"" Al Siebert, a workforce stress expert and Resiliency Center director told CNN.com.That said, while it might not have been cool when Radio Shack (NYSE:RSHCQ) fired 400 employees by email in 2011, not everyone's feathers were ruffled. Wall Street often rewards layoffs with subsequent share price appreciation. After all, layoffs lead to lower overhead costs and, theoretically, more efficiency.  And then there's this method of dispatching employeesAt least Montgomery Burns, fictional tycoon from The Simpsons, fires face-to-face. He says to a quaking employee seated over Burns' trap door (Burns' usual method of dispatching firees),""All right, let's make this sporting, Leonard. If you can tell me why I shouldn't fire you without using the letter ""e,"" you can keep your job.""Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Cheap Stocks for 2014: Tech's Best Buys,"Dec 15, 2013 at 2:00PM","Looking for a deep-discount value play in the tech sector? The market is littered with cheap stocks for 2014. Some tech stocks are cheap for good reason while others seem spring-loaded for a huge bounce next year. Here are three of tech's best buys right now.Rackspace Hosting (NYSE:RAX) raced to all-time highs last January, but then disappointed on three of its next four earnings reports. Rackspace shares have fallen 53% year to date, creating this interesting five-year chart:RAX DATA BY YCHARTSThe stock suffered in 2013 as rampant revenue growth failed to pull earnings along for the ride. Sales are growing at a 15% annual rate while trailing earnings are down 40% year over year.But that's a conscious decision, said Rackspace CEO Lanham Napier in the third-quarter conference call last month. The cloud computing pioneer is all about top-line growth right now, far more important than bottom-line earnings at the moment. ""We've said throughout 2013 that our No. 1 financial objective has been to accelerate our growth rate,"" Napier said.To reach Napier's 20% revenue growth target in 2014, the company needs to do a better job of explaining what's different and better about the all-important OpenStack cloud computing solution. The OpenStack product is already a big deal as a cloud platform, and Napier sees it becoming equally important as a revenue driver. ""However, we don't believe we've yet proven this to the market,"" he said.So the top job for Lanham Napier and Rackspace in 2014 is to educate investors about the business value of an open cloud computing platform. Do that, and the stock will bounce back to those stratospheric January levels and beyond.Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) has already proved that there's investable value in open software. Red Hat's eponymous operating system is just as free (as in speech and as in beer, unless you're buying enterprise-level support contracts) as Rackspace's OpenStack. Open software is all Red Hat does, after all.Red Hat's five-year chart looks eerily familiar:RHT DATA BY YCHARTSHere's another company hell-bent on driving massive sales growth. Red Hat investors have been richly rewarded over the past five years, even though the market enthusiasm ran dry in 2013. Share prices have fallen 12% year to date.Both Red Hat and Rackspace have more than doubled their sales over the past five years, setting the stage for huge earnings and cash flows when the companies shift out of high-growth mode. By reducing their sales and marketing budgets and nixing other growth-oriented programs, both of these companies can leverage their margins and watch the stocks follow suit.This won't happen in 2014, of course, but you're looking at a mighty fine entrance point on both Red Hat and Rackspace right now. The rewards might be delayed, but fortune favors the prepared.Let me round this list off with a different kind of value play. IBM (NYSE:IBM) shares have plunged 10% year to date and trade 20% below the all-time highs that were set in March this year.This is no damn-the-torpedoes growth story, but a downright secular tech giant in the middle of yet another game-changing transformation. This time, Big Blue is moving away from low-margin hardware sales to refocus on software and services. Once again, cloud computing is a major theme.Change is always tough, and this particular transformation hurts. IBM is letting hardware sales go to the competition in exchange for higher margins, and the net effect hasn't had a blindingly obvious positive effect on the bottom line yet. IBM also misjudged the market impact of recent changes in the Chinese economy, further damaging the revenue line.IBM DATA BY YCHARTSBut you know, IBM has been here before. The company that built the first PC traces its computing industry history back to punch cards and mechanical tabulators. Obsolete products are nothing new to IBM, and the company has always adjusted to the changing times. This time is no different.Expect IBM shares to roar back to life in 2014 as the software-based makeover starts to pay real dividends. Panic-selling a hundred-year survivor on a couple of soft quarters is always a bad idea, but buying in while other investors are selling can make you rich.So those are my top three best buys in tech for 2014: two high-flying growth plays and one misjudged giant.

7 High-Paying Jobs for the Future of Big Data,"Nov 23, 2013 at 10:06AM","Like it or not, big data is here to stay -- and jobs in these seven occupations with an average salary of almost $72,000 per year are set to add over a million jobs to the U.S. economy by 2020.Defining big data""Big data"" is a buzz phrase thrown around often, and it really only entered into the conversations of the American public over the last few years. You can see that people searching the phrase on Google has skyrocketed since the beginning of 2012:SOURCE: GOOGLE.In October 2012, the Harvard Business Reviewdeclared that big data was ""The Management Revolution"" and a Wall Street Journal report from October of this year noted that almost two thirds of companies have invested or plan to invest in big-data technology within the next year. Garnter projects big-data spending will more than double from $27 billion in 2012 to $55 billion in 2016.Though defining big data can be a challenge, a recent Forbesarticle put it nicely when it noted:Big data is a collection of data from traditional and digital sources inside and outside your company that represents a source for ongoing discovery and analysis.We live in such a connected world with so much information produced that companies are often inundated with information. IBM reports that ""90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone."" Every interaction from a Facebook ""like"" to a Google search or click on a headline from Yahoo! lends to some small stored bit of information. But beyond what we do on the Internet, there is the data generated from traffic sensors, sales figures at small businesses, and the immense amount of data utilized in hospitals about patients to help patients.But big data isn't simply the collection of information -- and the age-old question of ""if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"" is eerily similar to one that I'd like to pose to you: If information is collected and no one is there to analyze it, is it actually information?The biggest challenge cited by the managers surveyed by The Wall Street Journal about big data was ""determining how to get value from the data,"" and the only way to do that is through people, and workers in these seven career fields are the ones poised to benefit the most from this data renaissance.Software Developers 2010 Employment: 913,1002020 Projected Job Growth: 30%2010 Average Salary: $90,5302020 Jobs Added: 270,900SOURCE: BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.Certainly software developers -- those who create and write computer programs -- aren't exclusively involved in big data, but with each passing day, more people are needed to make the programs that can effectively and effortless collect, synthesize, and process all of the data created. For college graduates with degrees in fields like computer science, software engineering, mathematics, or some other related field, the future for developers was bright 10 years ago, and that remains true today.Market Research Analysts 2010 Employment: 282,7002020 Projected Job Growth: 41%2010 Average Salary: $60,5702020 Jobs Added: 116,600SOURCE: BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.Market research analysts are going to be the ones who work in almost every industry who view the massive amounts of data that is collected and then report on their findings. They are those ones who will help companies figure out what goods or services people want, who exactly will buy them, and also what price they should be sold for. Since they can work in a variety of fields, from consumer product companies, manufacturing firms, or even banks, there is a lot of demand for the people who can make decisions based on all the data that is collected. A career as a market research analyst is best prepared for with a degree in statistics or math, with coursework in communications or other social sciences.Postsecondary Teachers 2010 Employment: 1,756,0002020 Projected Job Growth: 17%2010 Average Salary: $62,0502020 Jobs Added: 305,700SOURCE: BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.Although this is the largest and broadest field, postsecondary teachers (those who teach students beyond high school) will be in high demand as a result of big data. There will be more and more students who pursue careers in big data (through one of the other careers noted here), and as a result, there will be a need for people who are prepared, capable, and willing to teach them the required skills they need to succeed.Database Administrators 2010 Employment: 110,8002020 Projected Job Growth: 31%2010 Average Salary: $73,4902020 Jobs Added: 33,900SOURCE: BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.It is absolutely important to have people analyzing the data -- but if they don't have secure and sound data to analyze, they'll make wrong decisions. Database administrators are the ones who use the software and tools created by the developers to store and organize the data that will be used by market research and other analysts. While a degree in any computer-related field can set someone on the path to becoming a database administrator, one in management information systems (MIS) is often the best fit.Computer Systems Analysts 2010 Employment: 544,4002020 Projected Job Growth: 22%2010 Average Salary: $77,7402020 Jobs Added: 120,400SOURCE: BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.Computer systems analysts are often the intermediaries between a corporation's IT department and its business departments. As big data progresses, computer systems analysts are an essential cog to help a business understand its current computer systems and make recommendations for expanded systems and processes to meet the ever-evolving world of big data. Since computer systems analysts deal almost equally with both technology and business-related tasks, a degree that provides equal weighting in both is incredibly beneficial, and often management information systems (MIS) can provide that.Information Security Analysts, Web Developers, and Computer Network Architects 2010 Employment: 302,3002020 Projected Job Growth: 22%2010 Average Salary: $75,6602020 Jobs Added: 65,700SOURCE: BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.Seemingly the catch-all bucket utilized by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, people in this category of career are utilized in a variety of different ways. Information security analysts ensure data is safe and secure, web developers create websites that attempt to capture the best practices wielded from big data, and network architects ensure that data and information flows seamlessly. Like the others, degrees in computer science, programming, or another related field is immensely beneficial.Network and Computer Systems Administrators 2010 Employment: 347,2002020 Projected Job Growth: 28%2010 Average Salary: $69,1602020 Jobs Added: 96,600SOURCE: BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.Lastly, there are those who help ensure that a company's computer networks run and operate smoothly on a day-to-day basis. With the vast amount of information collected, both internal and external computer networks will be under increased demand and strain, and there will be a high demand for the people who can ensure things continue without a hitch. Often a degree in computer or information sciences is a key point of entry, but a degree in an engineering field (whether it be computer or electrical) can also be immensely helpful.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Positive Trends Have 3 Tech Companies Poised for Future Success,"Dec 4, 2013 at 11:30PM","Positive trends have Silicon Valley tech giants Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and the century-old International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) poised for future success in each of their diverse, but somewhat interrelated, businesses. Investors who take notice can be rewarded. Advertisers like FacebookAssuming continued low operating costs, mostly for labor and relatively inexpensive computer infrastructure, an increase in the number of ads placed on Facebook should also translate into higher profits for the company.For Facebook, the key to more ads is growth in the number of users, especially from mobile platforms like smartphones and tablets. A positive trend is sales of those products have been increasing. The user base, now at over 1 billion strong, has been increasing at a brisk pace and there is no reason to think that it will slow down. Demographics are on the side of Facebook. Every day more people who are likely to buy products advertised on its website become connected to the Internet.Big in dataThough the ages, IBM was the prototypical tech company. Known for making both large mainframes and personal computers, the NY-based company has sold its PC business and is transitioning away from hardware. It is now big in business-to-business services and specialized software applications. It is also big in data, Big Data that is. IBM is at the forefront of the revolution in collecting, processing, and disseminating huge chunks of digital information that are used in a variety of different enterprises including social networks and online retailing. IBM is also big in another business, the so-called ""Internet of things"" in which ordinary items such as light fixtures, thermostats, toasters, and even your car are interconnected and controlled using apps on smartphones and tablets. Although the total return to shareholders who reinvest dividends and EPS gains have been relatively good over the recent past, IBM would like to reverse subpar revenue growth. The company is betting on Big Data and the Internet of things to do that.IBM Total Return Price data by YChartsNew gadgets will drive growthThere are plenty of reasons to think that Apple will continue the success it has had in gadgets and subsequent growth opportunities for investors. The company shows no signs of slowing down on the innovation front which, along with its ""think differently"" corporate culture, has been responsible for much of Apple's phenomenal success since co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak started tinkering with computers while they were growing up in Silicon Valley in the 1970's.Over the last few months Apple has refreshed many of its major product lines adding new features to the iPhone such as 64-bit computing architecture, larger capacity battery, one-touch access using a fingerprint sensor in the home button, and in the case of the new ""5c"" model, very vivid colors. The iPad Mini has been fitted with a Retina Display like its larger cousin, which itself has been made lighter and thinner than its previous version. The ""bigger"" iPad Air is a gem of a device and one analyst wrote ""it is the best tablet I've ever reviewed.""Perhaps a little further down the road Apple will also be betting on the success of its own vision for the Internet of things.

A Massive Hedge Fund Gradually Shifts Its Largest Bet,"Dec 16, 2013 at 6:47PM","Bridgewater Associates, the hedge fund founded by Ray Dalio, has a fascinating composition. It mixes concentrated investments in macroeconomic categories (usually through large, liquid ETFs) with a plethora of smaller positions. The fund's equity holdings disclosed on Sept. 30, 2013, stood at $11.8 billion. Three holdings made up 89% of the fund: the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:SPY), the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEMKT:VWO), and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEMKT:EEM). The last 11%, or $1.3 billion of holdings, was split among no fewer than 308 positions. Out of these positions, 241 represented less than 0.1% each of the total. The smallest position was a $95,000 stake in Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN). Now, to you and me, $95,000 may seem like a decent bit of coin. But in relation to $11.8 billion, it's infinitesimally small -- expressed as a percentage, it's 0.0008% of the total. To put this in perspective, picture a boulder that weighs one ton -- 2,000 pounds. Now take a slice of bread, tear off a fourth of that slice, and place that fourth on top of the boulder: This is the equivalent relationship in weight between the value of the Huntington Bancshares position and Bridgewater Associates' total publicly disclosed equity portfolio.Perusing the holdings of such a massive fund is endlessly fascinating, but it also illuminates some of the futility of trying to understand a particular hedge fund's decisions from a quarter-end disclosure that lists only positions held. Nonetheless, let's see if we can glean some insight from the latest filing.A significant concentration slowly shiftsBridewater Associates' investment in three huge ETFs has gradually evolved as the U.S. economy has improved. If we go back a little less than two years ago to 2011, we see that the fund held a huge bet on broad-based U.S. stocks through the SPY ETF, with a smaller position in emerging markets through the Vanguard and iShares ETFs:SOURCE: BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES SEC 13F FILINGSOver the last two years, the U.S. markets have outperformed emerging markets, as evidenced by the SPDR S&P 500's relative outperformance versus the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF:SPY DATA BY YCHARTS.As the U.S. markets continue to gain traction, it appears Bridgewater is taking profits along the way and reallocating the proceeds to emerging markets, effectively flipping the trade on its head. Here's what the composition looks like today:SOURCE: BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES SEC 13F FILINGSThe fund still has deep exposure to U.S. equities but may be anticipating a general investor rotation into emerging markets as the global economy improves and investors regain their risk appetite.Other noteworthy actions: goodbye to BenIn other developments, the fund closed out its position in Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN), the global investment manager better known as Franklin Templeton Investments. At 0.16%, this was one of the fund's more prominent holdings. Don't be surprised if you see this company show up in a future filing; it appears to be a favored trading position. Over the last three years, the fund has disclosed positions as small as $367,000 and as large as the $18.3 million stake it held on June 30, 2013. Franklin Resources has basically replicated the year-to-date return of the S&P 500 index but with a little more volatility, which may explain why it appears to be a frequent trade rather than a held position:BEN DATA BY YCHARTS.An anchor and a tech turnaroundAt 0.1% of total portfolio value, General Electric (NYSE:GE) is one of the larger holdings filed in this quarter outside of the ""big three"" ETFs. GE joins about 22 other stocks with a weighting of at least one-tenth of a percent, which encompasses a broad representation of U.S. tech, industrial, and retail giants, including Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), American Express (NYSE:AMX), and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). Positions like these likely provide a counterweight to the fund's overall concentration in emerging markets.GE has posted similar numbers so far in 2013 compared with 2012. Through the first three quarters of reported earnings, total revenue decreased 1.7% from the prior year, operating income was nearly identical to 2012's at 9.7%, and net income, at 9.3% of sales, showed less than a 0.5% improvement. But as a representative S&P 500 stock with bright prospects in an improving U.S. economy, GE seems a credible choice as an anchor to the fund's non-ETF positions.Finally, the fund added struggling tech behemoth Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), valued at 0.15% of the total portfolio on Sept. 30, 2013. HP's declining revenue is a long-term concern as it seeks to compete in both the shrinking PC market and newer growth opportunities in the enterprise and cloud-computing markets. The company has been able to prop up quarterly earnings through cost-cutting during 2012 and 2013, and the investment community has viewed this action more or less favorably, as HP's stock is up nearly 90% this year. HP will be an interesting holding to review on Bridgewater Associates' next 13F filing. Additional shares may indicate that the fund expects revenue growth to follow the operations optimization, while a static position or trimming may indicate that the fund is merely looking for a quarter or two of further momentum in the stock.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Why Your Health Insurance Could Be ""Exchanged"" Soon","Sep 10, 2013 at 6:30PM","It's trending now -- but not on Twitter.Switching retiree health insurance to private health insurance exchanges appears to be the new thing for big companies. IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWC) are the latest to make the move. Both companies announced last week that they will move some retirees off company health plans in favor of having the former employees shop for their own insurance using private exchanges. ""Exchanging"" health insurance seems likely to keep on trending. And this trend probably won't be limited to just retirees and large employers, either. Increasingly more current employees of organizations of all sizes are likely to move to private exchanges. Here's why this trend is catching on -- and how you can potentially profit.Exchanging awayIn the private exchange model, employers provide a fixed amount of money to retirees or employees. These individuals then use the money to purchase health insurance on their own through a private health insurance exchange with which the employer has contracted.Employers are moving to the model primarily for a simple reason: controlling costs. In IBM's case, the company plans to shift around 110,000 former employees to private exchanges to help minimize the retirees' added costs. IBM projected that costs for Medicare supplement policies were on track to triple by 2020. Retirees would absorb the impact of these higher costs, because the company capped its contributions to retirees back in the 1990s.Time Warner cited the potential for lower costs to retirees in announcing its transition to a private exchange. The cable operator also highlighted increased choices of coverage as another key benefit for retirees. Private exchanges allow buyers to find the health plan that best matches their individual needs and preferences.The appeal of holding down costs while giving current and former employees more options has many organizations looking at the prospect of moving to private health insurance exchanges. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey conducted earlier this year found that 29% of organizations with 5,000 or more employees are considering private exchanges. 9% of organizations with 200 or more employees are contemplating offering health coverage via a private exchange.Although the concept of private health insurance exchanges has been around for several years, many employers had not seriously considered using them until fairly recently. It seems likely that private exchanges could experience significant growth especially if highly visible companies like IBM and Time Warner experience success.The trend is your friendWe're looking at the beginning of what could be a major trend in employer health insurance. Savvy investors know that buying the right stocks as a trend emerges can lead to huge gains. Which stocks appear poised to benefit from the private exchange trend?Aon (NYSE:AON) stands out as one possible winner. The firm's Aon Hewitt division, which offers human resources consulting and outsourcing services, operates exchanges for corporate customers' employees and retirees. The company enrolled more than 100,000 employees on its Corporate Health Exchange last fall. Aon Hewitt's research indicates that 44% of employers think that using a private health insurance exchange will be their preferred approach for providing health insurance to employees within the next three to five years.Marsh & McLennan (NYSE:MMC) should gain as use of private exchanges increase. The company's Mercer business unit announced in July that five initial large customers had signed up for its Mercer Marketplace exchange. While these customers weren't identified, Mercer indicated that they ranged in size from 800 to 25,000 employees.Benefits consultant Towers Watson (NASDAQ:TW) also looks to be a likely beneficiary from the private health insurance exchange trend. IBM went with the company's Extend Health exchange for Big Blue retirees. Towers Watson also operates exchanges for active and part-time employees.Investors don't necessarily have to pick just one of these stocks. All three could emerge as winners with increased adoption of private exchanges. If you're only interested in one, though, Marsh & McLennan will pay you the most to wait for these exchanges to really catch fire. The big insurance and consulting firm sports a 2.4% dividend yield. A decent dividend with an opportunity to capitalize on an emerging trend -- now that's something to tweet about.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

9 Top Stocks to Buy in 2014,"Dec 21, 2013 at 8:20AM","As a new year approaches, we decided to ask some of our top analysts for their favorite stock idea for 2014. Here are nine companies that look compelling right now.Jim Gillies:  It's hard to find a positive word about IBM (NYSE: IBM) nowadays. Year-over-year revenues have shrunk for six consecutive quarters, it's losing valuable government ""cloud"" contracts to upstarts like Amazon Web Services, and it seems a lock to win the raspberry for ""worst-performing Dow stock of the year award"" for 2013.And yet, the valuation has been punished severely for these sins and arguably more. IBM is still on track to generate in the neighborhood of $16 billion or $17 billion in free cash flow in 2013. That cash will be deployed into its ever-growing dividend (raised 19% annually over the past decade), and into its aggressive share repurchase plan that has reduced share count by 37% over that same decade. And the company still carries the tacit imprimatur of Warren Buffett, who has branded IBM as one of Berkshire Hathaway's ""Big Four"" investments.Something of a contrarian ""Dog of the Dow"" pick, IBM currently sells for barely 10 times next year's expected earnings, well below the multiple on the average stock in the S&P 500. I expect this year's loser to be next year's winner as the company's cash deployment ratchets up the share price. A multiple expansion to, say, 12 times earnings would be gravy -- holiday gravy, if you will.Patrick Morris: With the calendar turning to 2014, one stock worth considering is e-commerce giant eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). I've never been one to watch the market movements and attempt to make judgments on a company from those. But the reality is that eBay has been essentially flat over the last year, while the NASDAQ is up almost 40%, and I think that is largely unjustified.eBay has continued to deliver strong results, and the most recent quarter was no exception. Through the first nine months of the year, its operating income had risen 16.5% relative to the first nine months of last year. Not to mention its payments business (PayPal) continues to watch its revenues grow by more than 18% year over year, and eBay's total quarterly revenue growth has consistently stood at 14%.So the company is continuing to deliver impressive growth and results, but its price doesn't reflect that. Consider that its trailing price to earnings ratio currently stands at 25.5, which is almost identical to Costco and below the 29 held by Google. I understand that's not exactly a fair comparison, but eBay seemingly still has quite a potential growth runway ahead of it.The last thing I will note is that many people think eBay is simply a place where people bid on products, but excluding autos, 75% of its transactions were made at a fixed price. Amazon is the clear leader in the rapidly expanding e-commerce space, but eBay has a commanding position in the No. 2 spot.Matt DiLallo: The Fed might slowly be taking away the punch bowl, but that shouldn't taper the prospect that 2014 will be the year that the housing market finally hits its stride. In fact, The Fed's tapering move just might be what jump-starts the still sluggish housing market. That's why I think homebuilders should do well in 2014, with PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) being the stock I'd buy for 2014 and beyond.The housing market is currently pretty low on inventory, which is one reason home prices have trended higher. That trend will only continue as we see the end to historically low mortgage rates. Buyers need to move fast in order to lock in these low rates.Where PulteGroup fits into the equation is that its multi-brand strategy has it well-positioned to really deliver as housing recovers. For example, its Centex brand focuses on first-time buyers. These buyers have been cautious to get into the market, but seeing an end to historically low mortgage rates will likely convince many that the time to buy is in 2014. At the same time rising home prices nationwide are freeing up many current homeowners to sell in order to move up into a nicer home. The Pulte Home brand caters to move-up buyers, while the Del Webb brand focuses on those in the active adult marketplace that are now in a better position to retire and enjoy life.Bottom line, PulteGroup's multi-brand strategy, when combined with its renewed focus on creating shareholder value, has it well-positioned to deliver exceptional returns in 2014.Chuck Saletta: If there's one stock I'd consider buying for 2014, that stock would be Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI). As the largest natural gas transporter and storage operator in North America, Kinder Morgan is well-positioned to profit from increasing demand for natural gas. Between coal power plant shutdowns, an aging fleet of nuclear power plants, and the inherent inefficiency and unreliability of many renewable energy sources, natural gas is the most logical candidate for new power generators.In addition to the electric generating capabilities, natural gas is generally the cheapest and most common means to heat homes. It's also gaining significant traction as a transportation fuel, especially among fuel-hungry trucks. Regardless of how and where it's used, natural gas needs to get from the shale fields and other sources to where it's needed, when it's needed. That's where Kinder Morgan shines.The business case is clear, and the investment case is strong enough that I own shares of Kinder Morgan in the real-money Inflation-Protected Income Growth portfolio. Take a business model at the center of the energy economy, and add a reasonable valuation, a covered and growing dividend, and a balance sheet without too much leverage, and the result is a company whose stock is worth buying for 2014.Brendan Mathews: Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA) is the largest cable company in Europe. It is heavily laden with debt, generates GAAP losses, pays no dividend, and is exposed to Europe's economic woes. For those reasons, you might not be interested at first glance. But, if you dig a bit deeper, the company actually looks very attractive. It's got great leadership following a proven strategy, and it's adding new subscribers and revenue per subscriber.John Malone, the famous ""cable cowboy,"" is Liberty Global's chairman, and the company is following the same playbook that Malone used to build Tele-Communications into the largest cable provider in the United States, before it was sold to AT&T in 1999. Liberty Global is using cheap debt to acquire smaller cable systems. While it doesn't generate GAAP earnings, the company does generate healthy amounts of free cash flow -- over $3 billion in the past year. Malone is using that cash to upgrade its cable system and aggressively repurchase Liberty Global shares, both of which should generate long-term value for shareholders. Using this same basic strategy, Malone generated more than 30% compound annual returns for Tele-Communications shareholders.And, despite the economic gloominess in Europe, Liberty Global's business is doing well. Liberty Global is on pace to add 1 million new subscribers this year. Its current customers are buying more services -- 40% of subscribers now pay for a ""triple-play"" package, up from 30% a year ago. This has driven a 29% increase in revenue per customer.Maxx Chatsko: Despite nearly doubling the gains of the S&P 500 this year, there are several upcoming catalysts for Momenta Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:MNTA) that could lead to even bigger gains for investors in 2014. The company's competitive advantage rests in its ability to analyze, characterize, and design complex molecules -- which speeds development time and reduces costs. The MIT rollout proved its novel approach to drug development in 2010 with the approval of its first product, a generic version of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection, which pushed operating margins to 63% on revenue of $283 million in 2011! Unfortunately, competing generics have since eroded the edge for the company's only product.Momenta will swing back into profits next year if it can market its second product, a generic version of Teva's Copaxone. Investors were originally waiting for the last Copaxone patent to expire in September 2015, but a summer decision by the Court of Appeals may have expedited the Food and Drug Administration's review date to May 2014. While Teva intends to go to the Supreme Court with an appeal and Momenta isn't the only company with a generic drug ready, simply becoming profitable or even breakeven would smooth out the ride on the road to disruption for investors. I think it's likely generic versions will get the green light next year, which makes Momenta -- with $250 million in cash and an impressive and relatively undervalued pipeline -- a long-term buy-and-hold company at today's prices.Simon Erickson: My one stock for 2014 is Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED). The company makes organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), used to light the displays of consumer electronic devices. Much of the company's history has been devoted to R&D, providing the behind-the-scenes technology for Samsung's Galaxy smartphones in exchange for semi-annual royalty payments.But UDC is finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Commercial material sales have begun to meaningfully contribute to the top line – increasing 176% year-over-year and 11% sequentially during the 3rd quarter. The company reported a solid profit, even without the royalty (which gets paid in 2Q and 4Q). Universal Display is breaking into the market in multiple ways – partnering with the lighting division of Philips, providing materials for a new Samsung OLED television, and is even rumored to be in an upcoming ""iWatch"" from Apple! OLED is definitely one to keep an eye on in 2014.Jim Mueller: I'm offering up the latest addition to the real-money portfolio I manage for The Motley Fool, Lindsay (NYSE:LNN). It sells mechanized irrigation systems to farmers. You've probably seen these while driving through or past croplands -- big, wheeled piping systems spraying water onto crops.Irrigating this way is more efficient than gravity irrigation (flowing water across fields), resulting in higher crop yields while using less water (1/3 – 1/2 less). Over the past decade, mechanized irrigation in the U.S. has grown from 35% to 46% penetration, while gravity irrigation has fallen from 50% to 39%. The opportunity comes from continued penetration gains domestically and international growth. Worldwide, 90% of cropland under irrigation uses gravity irrigation. Thanks to a growing population, farmers will need to produce more food; and thanks to limited water supplies, they'll need to do it while using less water. Replacing gravity irrigation with mechanized irrigation is a big step in that direction.In addition, Lindsay is developing and selling ""smart"" systems that use feedback from sensors to distribute irrigation to where it's needed. This makes irrigation even more efficient.An investment in Lindsay plays into three big, global trends: the two mentioned above (growing population and limited water) and more droughts. With four severe droughts in the last eight years here in the U.S., farmers ""don't want Mother Nature to control our destiny anymore.""Tamara Walsh: 2013 proved a record year for Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA), with the stock soaring more than 300% year-to-date. However, 2014 holds even more promise for the electric-car maker. Tesla continues to see strong demand for its Model S cars and is ramping up production to meet that demand. In fact, Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the company is on track to hit an annualized rate of deliveries that exceeds 40,000 cars per year by late 2014. Global demand for Tesla's cars is also accelerating at a rapid clip.While European sales are already strong, Tesla is just getting started in China and other parts of Asia. The EV maker began taking Model S reservations in China last quarter, and plans to begin deliveries there during the first quarter of 2014. As the world's largest market by sales of premium sedans, China is an exciting piece of the puzzle for Tesla going forward.Another important catalyst for Tesla is the ongoing expansion of its supercharger network. There are now 34 supercharger stations in the United States, and six so far in Europe. Tesla is now on track to have stations covering 80% of the U.S. population and parts of Canada as soon as next year. Moreover, Tesla plans to cover 100% of the population of Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria, Denmark, and Luxembourg with superchargers by the end of 2014. This is a significant part of the company's value proposition and it should help drive Model S sales in the year ahead. With these catalysts and more on the horizon, Tesla is a stock I want to own in 2014 and many years to follow.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

"Monetary Policy, Explained","Jun 4, 2013 at 10:30PM","Now and then, you probably run across headlines like the following:""Japan Keeps Monetary Policy Steady Amid Deflation Fight""""Bernanke Warns of 'Premature Tightening' in Monetary Policy""""Business Groups Back May Monetary Policy Decisions""If you're like many people, they make you a bit uneasy, as you don't have a good handle on what ""monetary policy"" actually is. Let's remedy that, shall we? Understanding its basics can help you make sense of financial news and our national and global financial condition.In a nutshellAmerica's monetary policy is set by the Federal Reserve, our central bank, which influences the amount of money and credit in our economy, and, therefore also influences interest rates, inflation, and our economy's health and performance.The Federal Reserve (which you can now refer to as ""the Fed,"" due to your increased savviness) aims to have our economy in excellent condition, which means having interest rates and inflation at moderate, reasonable rates, and unemployment low.How does the Fed try to achieve these goals? With its ""three instruments of monetary policy"": open market operations, the discount rate, and reserve requirements.3 instrumentsDecisions about open market operations are made by the Federal Open Market Committee, and involve the Fed buying or selling securities such as Treasury bonds, notes, and bills. When it buys them, it pays by depositing money with a bank or securities dealer, and when it sells them, it deducts their value from the account(s) of the purchasing banks or securities dealers. In this way, the Fed is adding or removing money from the money supply. Money added can then be loaned out, ultimately to businesses and consumers, stimulating the economy and boosting interest rates. Money removed from the supply can slow down our economy, increasing interest rates, too. A rapid rise in the supply of money boosts inflation -- and vice versa -- and is another way that monetary policy affects our everyday lives. (The Fed would generally like to see inflation rates in the 2% to 3% range.)The discount rate is the rate that Federal Reserve Banks charge other financial institutions for short-term loans. When the rate is low, banks are more likely to borrow, thus increasing the economy's money supply and stimulating growth. Conversely, a monetary policy involving rising rates will slow down the economy. The discount rate was in the news more than usual recently, when Senator Elizabeth Warren protested a planned doubling of interest rates for federal student loans to 6.8%, while banks were enjoying a 0.75% discount rate.Reserve requirements involve the Fed telling banks what portion of deposits they must keep in their vaults or deposited at a Federal Reserve Bank. It's another monetary policy tool; when the requirements are hiked, banks are less able to lend, the cost of credit rises, and some brakes are applied to the economy. A drop in requirements aims for opposite effects.The investing angleMonetary policy affects us as investors, too, because rising interest rates make existing bonds (with their lower rates) less attractive and lead to falling bond prices. Thus, stocks can become more attractive to many -- though savings accounts and CDs also become attractive, when they're paying significant interest. Falling interest rates can boost the real estate market, as mortgages become more affordable. If rates are very low, as they are now, they can discourage people from saving, while encouraging people -- and businesses -- to borrow. Many companies, such as Apple, IBM, Nike, and Microsoft, have been tapping the bond market for some cheap capital.Monetary policy is important for investing, but it also has a broader reach across the overall economy. A better understanding of monetary policy can make you a savvier citizen and a smarter investor.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Google and Microsoft Earnings Disappoint; Stock Prices Fall Back,"Jul 19, 2013 at 1:05PM","Both Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) headed into this Thursday's earnings reports on a full head of steam. Investors in the two tech giants saw signs of recovery three months ago, and the stocks have been crushing the S&P 500 in 2013. In particular, Google investors looked forward to the potentially powerful impact of an improved advertising model, known as ""enhanced campaigns."" For Microsoft, the positive story focused on the recent restructuring effort and a strong push into mobile computing.GOOG TOTAL RETURN PRICE DATA BY YCHARTSWell, the reports have been filed, and the stocks took a collective haircut. Google shares dropped as much as 4.6% on the news, while Redmond lost a massive 10% of its value overnight.For Google, the enhanced campaigns sure played a big part -- but in the wrong direction. The company is migrating all of its advertising customers to the new model at ""breakneck speed,"" and massive changes tend to hurt in the short term.Early adopters are reporting good results from their new-and-improved ad campaigns, which combined the separate tools for browser-based and mobile ad placements into one. The new model also promises to increase targeting and control, giving advertisers a more efficient way to reach the right potential customers. But Google didn't expect this change to boost its own results overnight. Instead, chief business officer Nikesh Arora characterized it as ""a big long-term bet.""For Microsoft, the mobile boost never happened. Investors might have guessed as much earlier on Thursday, when Mr. Softie's most important smartphone partner Nokia (NYSE: NOK) whiffed on its own second-quarter targets. Nokia shares fell as much as 5% on that report, unleashing at least three negative analyst comments, plus one outright downgrade.On top of that weak partnership, Microsoft spent a ton of cash on manufacturing and marketing the Microsoft Surface tablet, which hasn't gained much market traction from all this effort. The company posted a $900 million writedown of unsold Surface RT tablets. At the same time, Redmond's cost of goods sold increased 14% year over year, thanks to the Surface push, but total revenue only grew by 3%.The way I see it, Google is making appropriate long-term bets that should pay off somewhere down the road. I'm very comfortable owning my Google shares, and expect them to recover from this temporary setback very quickly.The story is much darker in Redmond. I wouldn't mind Microsoft betting the house on mobility, if there were any evidence that the effort is paying off. But billion-dollar write-offs point to a failed strategy shift.Maybe Microsoft would be better off doubling down on the enterprise-class software portfolio instead, leaving others to battle over consumer gadgets like tablets and smartphones. Spin-off or sell the successful Xbox operation to give it the best possible shot at rewarding investors, and let the core of Microsoft go head-to-head with IBM (NYSE:IBM) in the business-class sector instead.That stragety wouldn't be as sexy as Microsoft's current emphasis on chasing consumer dollars, but there's nothing wrong with boring, predictable success. I mean, take one look at this long-term comparison between boring old IBM and unfocused Microsoft, and then tell me which stock you'd rather have owned. (Adding Google to the same chart is almost unfair, since that stock price has grown 760% over the last decade. But Microsoft clearly can't beat Big G at its own game, while it might stand a chance in IBM's court.)MSFT TOTAL RETURN PRICE DATA BY YCHARTS"
Why Berkshire Hathaway Will Never Join the Dow,"Sep 11, 2013 at 8:12PM","SOURCE: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS.When most people think about the Dow Jones Industrial Average, they rightly assume it reflects the biggest corporations in the United States.But there are three notable exceptions: Apple, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), and Google. These companies are the first, third, and fourth largest America businesses by market capitalization, producing some of the best-known goods and services in the world.Given their size and prominence, one would be excused for wondering why they're not part of such a prominent blue-chip stock index. And the answer is that they can't be -- or, at least, not under the current construction of the Dow.""The mechanics of the first stock average were dictated by the necessity of computing it with paper and pencil,"" the official description explains. ""Add up the prices and divide by the number of stocks.""In other words, the weighting on the index is a simple average of the components' stock prices; the higher the price, the heavier the weight.Currently, for instance, IBM (NYSE:IBM) trades for $186.60 per share, making it the most expensive stock on the Dow. And correspondingly, it carries the heaviest weighting, accounting for 9.43% of the Dow's daily price movements.Alcoa (NYSE:AA), on the other hand, trades for only $8.06 per share, making it the least expensive component and thus the least weighted, accounting for a measly 0.41% of the daily movement. This goes a long way toward explaining why the index committee recently decided to replace it with Nike on the index.By this point, it's probably obvious why Berkshire, which trades for $170,489 a share, could never be a member of the Dow. But if not, take a look at the following figure.As you can see, if Berkshire was added to the Dow, the movement of the index would be virtually synonymous with the Omaha-based company's stock, as its shares would dictate 98.86% of the daily volatility of the Dow.This is the reason Rob Arnett, a pioneer of alternative forms of index investing, told my colleague Morgan Housel last year, ""If you had Berkshire Hathaway in the Dow, it would be the Berkshire Hathaway Index.""The point here is that, while the Dow remains the most widely cited stock index in the world, its overly simplistic construction prevents it from truly representing the biggest and most prestigious companies in the United States.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

What Will Cisco Do in 2014?,"Dec 19, 2013 at 12:30PM","Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is having a rough year. Shares of the networking equipment builder are up just 6% in 2013, while its Dow Jones (DJINDICES:^DJI) peers as a whole have risen 23%. The company beat earnings estimates in each of the four quarterly reports this year, but often followed up with weak guidance.Can Cisco bounce back from this disappointing performance next year, or will 2014 be another 12 months of frustration for Cisco shareholders?Cisco by the numbersAnalysts expect Cisco to report adjusted earnings close to $2 per share in calendar year 2014, which is no change from late-stage 2013 estimates. Revenue is seen shrinking 2% to roughly $47 billion.Last week, Cisco CFO Frank Calderoni reduced his long-term revenue growth targets from approximately 6% a year to something more like 4.5%. His earnings targets remain close to Wall Street's estimates, but the current streak of 15 quarters with year-over-year revenue growth is going to end this month.That's a scary prospect when your recent revenue history looks like this:CSCO REVENUE (ANNUAL) DATA BY YCHARTS.The Cisco story, in EnglishLet's hear it straight from CEO John Chambers. Speaking at last week's annual investor confab, Chambers spelled out exactly how he's looking at 2014:This next year will be the year of architectures. What's going to be the key turning point this year is, it won't be about architectures by business entity group. It's about how you work horizontally across all the business entities to solve your customers' problems.Chambers has seen smaller rivals unexpectedly steal a few juicy contracts. Recently, Alcatel-Lucent (NYSE:ALU) has come back from death's door to land several large-scale equipment contracts in key growth markets like China and Latin America. Cisco won't fight back against these incursions by dropping prices and sacrificing margins. Instead, Chambers wants to impress potential customers with the integrated depth of his company's product portfolio. Cisco wants to be the one-stop shop for all your information-technology needs, and not just networking.If that model sounds familiar, you've been following IBM (NYSE:IBM) over the last couple decades. The new Cisco looks a lot like the old IBM, even as Big Blue is working its way into a more focused business model.So that's the plan for 2014. Big strategy shifts often include temporary roadblocks, as Cisco's revenue forecasts are showing. Fellow Fool Tim Green says that this is the perfect time to buy Cisco shares, as investors worry far too much about Cisco's ability to execute.If you agree that Cisco is likely to work its way back from today's challenges, the stock certainly looks tempting. But I can't blame you for taking a ""wait and see"" approach, either. Cisco has a lot to prove right now and a track record of fumbles in the last five years.10 better buys than the Dow Jones Industrial AverageWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

What Every Business Can Learn From Thomson Reuters' Social Adventures,"Nov 7, 2013 at 6:48PM","When I say Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI), I bet your mind immediately strays to the company's namesake news service. And there's nothing wrong with that. Reuters is a global news giant with more than 150 years of history behind it. That's the kind of background that builds an immediately recognizable brand.But news reporting is actually less than half of Thomson Reuters' business. It's baked together with financial analysis services into the company's largest segment, which sits alongside a legal and regulatory consulting operation, tax and accounting services, and intellectual property management operations.Thomson Reuters is actually a very complex business, but all four of its core units have one thing in common: They all focus on collecting, managing, and distributing copious amounts of information, and mostly in digital formats.JAMES POWELL, CTO OF THOMSON REUTERS, SPEAKING AT THE TUCON 2013 CONFERENCE.Speaking at the recent TUCON 2013 conference, Thomson Reuters' chief technical officer, James Powell, dove into what it takes to move this digital machine into the social networking era.Ten years ago, the company wanted to design and build its own tools for everything. ""We believed that we were unique and special,"" Powell said. ""At the time, we were unique. We were doing millions of data transactions every second on our backbone, when this was a relatively uncommon thing.""But Thomson Reuters is not a technology company at heart. It's an information business and, at some point, it just made more sense to leave the technical platform building to experts in that field. So, when Thomson Reuters needed to drag its massive information operations into the social networking age, management told their eager engineers to sit back and let an off-the-shelf social networking solution do the heavy lifting.Catching the social waveReuters standardized its social platform on TIBCO Software 's (NASDAQ:TIBX) tibbr platform. It's kind of like Skype plus WebEx, designed for massive enterprise environments, and customizable to the nth degree. And because Tibco actually ran as a division of Thomson Reuters many years ago, Powell could expect an extremely high level of commitment and partnership. And that's exactly what Reuters was looking for.The downside to tweaking commercial products to your own liking is that it often takes time to get everything working. In this case, Thomson Reuters moved from concept discussions to a live tibbr launch in just five months. That includes building tibbr-based networking into Thomson Reuters' internal communication tools and into customer-facing products.Currently, the company has one technology that connects internal staffers to one another, external customers to other customers, and connects the company to the outside world. Building a solution like that from scratch would have taken years, if it were possible at all.Decisions, decisions!Now, tibbr is hardly the only social platform for corporations, and Tibco is not the only provider. Thomson Reuters could have gone with Cisco Systems ' (NASDAQ:CSCO) WebEx solution to achieve similar results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) didn't buy Skype because it's such a cool consumer-level messaging app -- Redmond sees serious enterprise value in Skype's messaging technology. Even stodgy old IBM (NYSE:IBM) has its IBM Connections solution for use, just like Thomson Reuters'.IBM Connect and Skype weren't exactly right for Reuters. The company has a history with Tibco, and wouldn't get this extreme level of customization and bend-over-backwards service anywhere else. These things are important to Reuters.But tibbr isn't necessarily the best choice for everyone. Companies with a deeper Cisco relationship might prefer WebEx for pretty much the same reasons why Tibco won the Reuters deal. Others might have specific feature requirements that only IBM or Skype could meet -- and not enough clout to make anybody create new features on demand.The Foolish takeawayReuters was smart to jump aboard the social bandwagon, even smarter for standardizing the whole company on one solution, and downright genius to find a vendor with exactly the right combination of technology and long-standing relationships.Reuters saw a gap in its business model, did its homework, and got the job done in the best possible way. On the vendor side, Tibco saw a partner with unmet needs, and threw the kitchen sink into pleasing this strategic partner.That's smart business thinking on both sides of the equation. You should demand no less from every company in your portfolio."
Is Buying Accenture Stock a Smart Health Care Play?,"Jun 10, 2013 at 10:46AM","Health care is hot these days. Hospital stocks are sizzling. Pharmaceutical shares are soaring. But there's another way to ride the health care wave. My recommendation is to consider buying Accenture (NYSE:ACN) stock as a health care investment. Here's why.Accent on health careSure -- Accenture is a global consulting firm with its fingers in many different industries. Health care just might be the strongest niche for the company, although a cursory glance at Accenture's revenue probably doesn't give that impression.SOURCE: COMPANY 10Q FILING. In terms of revenue, the company's Health & Public Services business segment stands as the smallest. Consider, however, that over the most recently reported six-month period, the segment's revenue growth rate of 12% was by far the strongest. Financial Services and Products revenue increased by 7% and 4%, respectively. However, Accenture's other two major segments actually lost revenue. If these growth rates persist, Health & Public Services will go from the company's smallest line of business to its biggest by the end of the decade.What's more is that the profitability of Health & Public Services is also growing more quickly than any other area. During the six months ended on Feb. 29, 2012, the segment's operating margin stood at 10%. Fast-forward to 2013 and that margin jumped to 14%. That's a huge shift in the right direction.Interestingly, Accenture is accomplishing all of this growth with relatively few staff in its health care business. The company reports around 15,000 employees focused on health care out of its total of 257,000 employees worldwide. In other words, less than 6% of its headcount generates 17% of its net revenue. Not bad.Medical meleeAccenture doesn't have the health care consulting pie all to itself, of course. Several other major players vie for a part of the market. IBM (NYSE:IBM) probably ranks as the most significant publicly traded rival to Accenture in the health care field. While Big Blue doesn't report revenue for health care, the industry is an important area of focus for the company. In 2011, IBM counted more than 8,000 staff dedicated to health care. That number is likely a good bit higher now.Like Accenture, IBM's customers include health care providers and health plans. One technology where IBM competes especially strongly is data analytics. The company also has pioneered use of artificial intelligence applied to health care with its Watson.Another smaller competitor with a foothold in health care is Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH). In 2012, Cognizant generated $1.9 billion from its health care segment, representing more than 26% of its total revenue. That figure also reflects a 19% jump compared to the prior year.Cognizant has beefed up its presence in the health care market as well. In late 2012, the firm acquired Medicall, which provides outsourced clinical operations. This purchase brought more than 600 U.S.-licensed nurses based in the Philippines into the Cognizant fold.Accenture appears to be in good shape to hold its own in the fight for market share. The company continues to see solid growth both in consulting and outsourcing across multiple geographic regions. Smart pick?There are lots of great health care investment alternatives available. The nice thing about buying Accenture stock is that it allows shareholders to profit from gains in nearly every part of the industry -- payers, providers, government, and life science organizations. Accenture stock has performed quite well recently. Shares are up 17% year-to-date and 38% over the past 12 months. Despite the solid run-up, the stock's price-to-earnings multiple still falls right in line with its range over the past three years. Analysts project earnings growth for Accenture over the next five years will be even better than the past five years. I suspect they're right. The company's large number of professionals with industry expertise should help it keep gaining additional customers worldwide. All factors considered, buying Accenture stock looks to be a pretty smart health care play.10 stocks we like better than AccentureWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Shocking Bill Your Daughter's Girl-Scout Cookie Money Is Paying,"Jun 29, 2013 at 7:00AM","Selling Girl Scout cookies is an annual spring ritual, one that my 8-year-old daughter participated in for the first time this year with her Brownie troop. I was proud of all the hard work and effort that I saw from dozens of local troop members and parents as they worked to raise funds for the activities that define what being a Girl Scout is.Yet recent revelations about the pension crisis at the national Girl Scouts of the USA organization have me questioning whether the efforts that my daughter and her troop-mates make are truly aimed at furthering their Girl Scout experience. With recent lawsuits between local Girl Scout councils and the national organization, mistakes in the way the GSUSA handled pension benefits have cast a shadow over what should have been untempered enthusiasm in light of the Girl Scouts' 100th anniversary last year.IMAGE SOURCE: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS, COURTESY DRMIES.What's behind the pension problem?The most shocking thing about the pension shortfall at the GSUSA is its size. A $347 million deficit at the national organization has led to major financial demands on the more than 100 local councils that help fund GSUSA. One council in middle Tennessee has sued the national organization, seeking to withdraw from the pension plan by alleging that the national organization breached its fiduciary duty in mismanaging the plan's finances. Without pulling out of the plan, it and other local councils will have to pay makeup contributions to the plan to cover pension liabilities. That in turn has put financial stress on local councils, leading to controversial moves like selling off summer-camp properties and laying off the locally based employees who help volunteers.For its part, the national organization blames the economic crisis for its pension troubles. As recently as 2007, the pension plan ran a surplus of about $150 million. In comments to the House Ways and Means Committee (link opens PDF file), GSUSA CEO Anna Maria Chavez argued that the organization's ""unfortunate situation is not anyone's fault,"" citing its decision to freeze its pension plan as having reversed the initially positive effects of recent amendments to pension-funding provisions that were designed to help it and other charities. Chavez now anticipates that the organization will have to contribute $145 million between 2014 and 2016 to help fund the defined-benefit plan for 13,000 participants, further noting that those contribution requirements are more stringent than for-profit corporations face.The national organization hopes to get at least some relief from the shortfall. If GSUSA can successfully lobby Congress, it could reduce the amount it has to contribute to the plan, giving it more time to remedy the shortfall. Still, any short-term reduction in required contributions would come at the expense of higher costs from 2017 to 2022, according to GSUSA projections.Get ready for moreThere's nothing all that unusual in the pension problems facing Girl Scouts of the USA. Plenty of private companies and public-sector employers are dealing with the same issues and have had to take similar steps to shore up their pension finances. Like the GSUSA, IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) froze their pension plans several years ago, as both companies decided that reducing the unpredictability of pension benefits made the most sense for them in managing their risk. More recently, Verizon and General Motors (NYSE:GM) took even more dramatic steps to limit pension risk, outsourcing substantial portions of their respective pension liabilities to insurance giant Prudential (NYSE:PRU). By doing so, the two employers passed off their obligations to an industry that's designed to handle the longevity risk that pension payments create.The main problem that employers throughout the nation are facing is that promises they made to their employees were more expensive than they initially planned for, and many of them were ill-equipped to handle the responsibility of funding their obligations in uncertain market environments. In the long run, the solution will require rethinking about long-term promises made to workers in their employee benefits, with particular attention to the worst-case scenarios that can create unexpected financial burdens.For the Girl Scouts, the pension controversy comes at a time in which the entire organization has gone through major changes in an effort to reinvent and modernize itself in order to reverse falling numbers of participants. For many parents, there's less incentive to work hard on fundraising efforts when they know that an alarmingly large portion of the proceeds from their labors will go not toward current programs for girls but rather toward getting a distant national organization out of its financial bind. To avoid the challenges the GSUSA now faces, other popular nonprofit organizations need to look closely at their employee benefits to keep would-be donors from balking at the prospect of funding pensions rather than supporting the current programs that do so much good.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Stratasys Buys MakerBot: What You Need to Know,"Jun 20, 2013 at 1:59PM","The rumors are true: Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) really is buying MakerBot. The move is Stratasys' second huge consolidation in the past year, and appears to be the second-largest, 3-D printing industry tie-up by value behind the Stratasys-Objet merger. Let's get right to the details now, and then we'll go over just what the deal means for Stratasys, for MakerBot, and for the 3-D printing industry as a whole.SOURCE: MAKERBOT, IMAGE CREDIT TO LOUIS SEIGAL.The deal, by the numbersAt a minimum, Stratasys will pay $403 million -- based on its stock price in what will be an all-stock transaction with the possibility for earn-outs -- in approximately 4.76 million new shares to acquire MakerBot. The deal could, and very well might, wind up being higher as the market digests this news. MakerBot's stakeholders can earn up to $201 million more in performance-based compensation, which will be tied to the value of an additional maximum of 2.38 million new shares by the end of 2014.Initial purchase value: $403 million, or 4.76 million shares (new issue)Performance bonuses: $201 million, or 2.38 million shares (new issue)Total potential value: $604 million, or 7.14 million new sharesExisting shareholders can expect to be diluted by approximately 18.5% if MakerBot earns all of its performance bonuses, assuming that there are no further share issues between now and 2014. It's hoped that MakerBot will more than justify this dilution by 2014, at which point it should become ""accretive to Stratasys' non-GAAP earnings per share,"" according to the company's press release.Make no mistake, though: Stratasys paid a major premium for MakerBot's brand cachet, and for its expected future growth. Although the company's revenue has accelerated rapidly in 2013, it is still far below Stratasys in terms of raw value:MakerBot most recent quarter revenue: $11.5 millionMakerBot fiscal 2012 revenue: $15.7 millionStratasys most recent quarter revenue: $71.2 millionStratasys fiscal 2012 revenue: $215.2 millionA back-of-the-envelope calculation annualizing out each of these quarterly revenue spikes (Stratasys' latest report was from its fiscal fourth quarter in 2012, but this was its first after the Objet merger) gives us an expected 193% year-over-year revenue growth rate for MakerBot and a comparatively tepid 24% year-over-year growth rate for Stratasys. The back-of-the-envelope result of $46 million in potential 2013 revenue gives MakerBot an implied forward price-to-sales ratio of 13.1. Stratasys' own price-to-sales ratio is 12.2 at the moment, so the premium may not be as outlandish as it seems at first glance.MakerBot could certainly meet that growth target, but it's a very ambitious one to hit, even for a small company that's positioned right in the center of the consumer push for 3-D printing. That positioning becomes very obvious when you look at the sales numbers MakerBot provided for the press release:MakerBot 3-D printers sold since 2009: over 22,000MakerBot 3-D printers sold since September 2012: 11,000Estimated worldwide 2012 desktop printer sales: 35,000-40,000Estimated worldwide 2013 desktop printer sales: 70,000-80,000What does it mean for 3-D printing?MakerBot is establishing itself as the brand to beat in a rapidly growing segment. Stratasys almost had to do this deal -- it lags behind industry peer 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) in the consumer market, with its cheapest current model clocking in at a purchase price of about $10,000. 3D Systems, by comparison, is now in direct competition with MakerBot thanks to its $2,500 CubeX -- which resembles the MakerBot Replicator 2s lined up at the top of this article in both price and styling:SOURCE: 3D SYSTEMS CUBIFY.More importantly, the 3-D printing industry is evidently shifting from the ""mainframe"" model of years past to the ""PC"" model of relatively affordable, relatively user-friendly consumer devices like the Replicator 2 and the CubeX. Under this analogy, Stratasys is the IBM of 3-D printing -- the big, industrial-strength industry leader that didn't catch on to the shift until it was already on them. MakerBot, then, is Apple right around the time it released the Apple II.I've written extensively on this epochal shift, noting especially that MakerBot has already begun displacing ""professional"" 3-D printers (the mainframes of the industry) at some key Stratasys and 3D Systems clients. However, there's room for debate over whether 3-D printing is fully into its PC era, or if it's still stuck in the minicomputer phase -- an in-between state where machinery almost makes sense for the average Joe, but not quite. The Apple II was one of the earliest consumer-friendly microcomputers, which is what PCs were called before we settled on that terminology.MakerBot's Bre Pettis is probably the closest thing 3-D printing has to a Steve Jobs. He's had an eclectic artistic career that's served him well as the chief evangelist for one of the most interesting new creative technologies of the day -- and besides that, he's a pretty charismatic executive, with magazine covers and many prime speaking engagements to his name. He's said things such as ""MakerBot is leading the next industrial revolution"" and ""the opportunity for creative explorers has never been better."" It's classic Jobs, and it worked well enough to deliver a huge payday for MakerBot right as they appear to be on their way toward truly explosive growth.So why did Pettis decide to take the offer?Can you imagine Steve Jobs meeting with IBM in 1978, a year after the Apple II hit the market, and accepting a buyout even as he talked about how insanely great computers would be for the world at every opportunity? MakerBot has one of the largest and most engaged online 3-D printing communities, with over 90,000 designs, 500,000 monthly visitors, and 1 million monthly downloads. It controls a substantial chunk of consumer sales -- at least as much as Apple controlled of PCs at its market-share peak in the early '80s.At an interview with VentureBeat earlier today, both Pettis and Stratasys CEO David Reis stressed that MakerBot would retain its independence and had gained vital opportunities to expand its brand through the acquisition. Access to superior manufacturing facilities and technological expertise is no doubt a big perk for Pettis and MakerBot, but it's worth wondering why the company was unable to secure these opportunities on its own if its future is supposedly so bright. Did Pettis really need Stratasys, or did he simply recognize the best opportunity for a high-priced exit?Low-cost, full-function devices like MakerBot's are probably more aligned with the future of 3-D printing than Stratasys' big, bulky machines. However, this consolidation leaves the industry with only two major players and a smaller pool of upstarts ready to challenge them. Will MakerBot still feel as compelled to push the edge of the technology further now that it only has to benefit Stratasys rather than best it?"
A.I. Innovation: Why IBM Bought Cognea,"May 28, 2014 at 12:30PM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) is betting big on a possible technology revolution, commonly referred to as the cognitive computing era. Throughout the years, the company has designed an artificial intelligence, Watson, which is essentially a supercomputer that's able to learn. In January, IBM created a business unit called Watson Group, in which the company is investing $1 billion, expecting to make profit of approximately $10 billion in the next ten years. Recently, the tech giant acquired Cognea, a start-up that works to give virtual digital assistants a variety of personalities that relate to the user. This move could further differentiate IBM's voice assistant technology from competitors like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), potentially solving its revenue growth issues.Improving WatsonThree years ago, Watson caught the public attention when it won the TV quiz show ""Jeopardy."" Since then, IBM has continued to improve the system, working with a group of doctors from M.D. Anderson to create a system that can generate possible treatments for cancer patients. Today, Watson is used as an important tool for insurer WellPoint, and also as an investment advisor for clients of Singapore-based bank DBS. Also, many start-ups funded by IBM base their services on this voice assistant. With the acquisition of Cognea, IBM can turn Watson into a computer that adopts a variety of personalities that relate to users in different contexts, whether in casual chatting or intellectual problem-solving.Battling with the public cloudAs IBM is lately undergoing revenue growth issues -- oftentimes linked to its private cloud business services being substituted by a public cloud -- Watson seems like a bold move to increase the company's top line in future years. As Bloomberg points out, the company has had a 77% increase in profit since 2007, far above the 42% broader market index. However, sales have decreased since 2011 and have shown no significant growth since 2007.The bright side is that many corporations still trust their valuable data to IBM's security and uptime track record, as the public cloud is often still be regarded as an unsafe method of storing important data. So, the company might need several years to create a track record that most major corporations can trust. In the meantime, IBM must look for new ways to increase sales. If it manages to surpass setbacks and tap into Watson's potential, IBM could increase both top and bottom lines significantly in the next years.The potential behind cognitive computingThe variety of uses given to Watson serve to illustrate its future potential. In regard to health care, this kind of cognitive computer can access vast amounts of data, including thousands of medical studies, patient records, prescriptions, and treatments for a variety of illnesses, as well as keep up with the latest studies. In that sense, Watson is able to put valuable data together to provide possible solutions to doctors. As the Wall Street Journal pointed out, IBM believes that these unique features can improve health care and lower costs.So far, IBM engineers have had to overcome many setbacks to make Watson work properly, but the battle is not over, yet. As a Bloomberg Businessweek article shows, prominent computer scientist Klaus-Peter Adlassnig suggests that Watson is currently equivalent to a doctor with an immense amount of knowledge, but ""cripplingly literal-minded."" With that being said, if IBM manages to eventually fix Watson's present weaknesses, it might turn into a valuable tool with a strong demand from everyday people, agencies, and corporations.Differentiation from other digital assistantsMicrosoft will release its own voice assistant, Cortana, later this year. This virtual assistant can engage in natural conversations with the user, and is designed to help with practical purposes like offering reminders or restaurant recommendations. Also, it learns from users' responses. Other digital assistants on the market include Google Now and Apple's Siri. Both are useful tools for searching, but Google Now tends to promote more Google-related services in Android.Certainly, the aforementioned voice assistants serve as added value to their respective operating systems. However, the large cloud data that IBM can access sets Watson apart. The company's digital assistant is essentially an expert that can help users with a variety of subjects. Plus, with the potential that could come from Cognea, Watson is better able to understand and relate to a user's personality. Michael Rhodin, Senior vice-president of IBM Watson Group, suggests that this characteristic will differentiate Watson from ""today's talking' smartphones.""Bottom lineThe acquisition of Cognea offers better differentiation features for Watson. Moreover, it is a way for IBM to increase revenue growth in the future. However, Watson must overcome several obstacles to truly evolve as a tool with a high demand in the market. "
What's Wrong With IBM Today?,"Jan 22, 2014 at 2:00PM","Shares of IBM (NYSE:IBM) plunged as much as 4.6% overnight, following last night's fourth-quarter report. The ultimate blue-chip stock is still down 3.5% as of this writing, shaving 42 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) all by itself. IBM's drop explains nearly all of the Dow's downward move today. It's the only Dow stock to slice more than 10 points off the index today.Big Blue beat Wall Street's earnings estimates but fell short of revenue projections. In fact, total sales dropped 5% lower year over year as IBM's hardware sales collapsed.In most cases, a revenue drop is a big red flag, a signal to run and hide, staying far away from this imploding business and its doomed-to-die stock. But it would be a mistake to apply that mindset to IBM's results, or to the company's recent trajectory in general.If IBM's lower sales scare you, it's time to ask yourself how the company managed to deliver strong earnings in spite of flagging revenue.Here's what's really going on inside IBM. The company is adjusting its business model to new market realities, shifting out of the low-margin hardware business to refocus on far more profitable software and services.There's even a change going on within the software department, as IBM's AIX Unix system keeps moving closer and closer to the Linux platform. IBM's proprietary systems will only shrink from here, and the company knows it. This quarter, IBM acknowledged that unstoppable trend by adding even more Linux compatibility to its AIX software.IBM started this shift way back in 2001, when it added basic Linux features to its AIX 5L release. Now, you can run Linux workloads both on IBM's AIX-powered middle tier and on System Z mainframes. The strategy here is focused on keeping IBM's customers happy and competitive, not on preserving IBM's aging in-house brands.IBM's entire server portfolio can run Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) Linux already, tapping into the red-hot platform's phenomenal growth. That's a sharp contrast to fellow computing powerhouse Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), which recognized the power of Linux platforms like Red Hat early on but decided to build its own Linux alternative instead. Forking the Red Hat code to provide an Oracle-branded Linux product seems silly to the former systems administrator in me, which explains why I prefer IBM's simpler partnering approach.So IBM is moving out of the low-margin server hardware business, the better to refocus on very profitable sales of software and support services. It's a sustainable long-term strategy that lets IBM trade easy top-line revenue for fatter bottom-line profit. In the long run, I'm sure that IBM investors will appreciate this strategy adjustment.Maybe it's time to take advantage of IBM's discount-priced shares, trading at a bargain basement 9.1 times forward earnings. From that perspective, IBM is the cheapest stock on the Dow right now.IBM P/E RATIO (FORWARD 1Y) DATA BY YCHARTS"
"Why JPMorgan Chase, IBM, and UnitedHealth Group Were the Dow's Only Losers Last Week","Apr 19, 2014 at 5:03PM","The Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) put up a solid performance last week, climbing more than 2% as the average once again made a push toward what bullish investors hope could be 2014's first all-time record high for the venerable average. Yet holding the Dow back were JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), which were the only three Dow-component stocks to post losses for the holiday-shortened week.IMAGE SOURCE: FLICKR.All three losing members of the Dow Jones Industrials can blame unfavorable earnings reports for the lion's share of their losses last week. JPMorgan Chase fell just a fraction of a percent, starting off the week on the wrong foot with an earnings report that featured an 18.5% decline in earnings stemming from weakness in its corporate and investment bank unit, with a more-than-20% drop in revenue from its fixed-income operations. The big question facing JPMorgan Chase shareholders is whether the declines in revenue and net income were connected to adverse conditions in various financial markets, or whether they reflect permanent structural changes in the bank's ability to earn profits. JPMorgan Chase has historically succeeded in producing strong internal returns, though, and with share valuations discounting its potential for future growth, JPMorgan Chase stock might well have dropped to interesting levels for bargain-hunting investors.SOURCE: PATRICK H ON FLICKR.IBM dropped almost 3% as the tech giant saw overall sales decline by 4%, falling short of what investors had hoped to see from Big Blue for the fifth straight quarter. The destruction in IBM's hardware business has been particularly severe, with a 23% drop in server-related revenue having been partially responsible for IBM's decision to sell off a major portion of its server business to Lenovo. By jettisoning poor-performing businesses, IBM hopes to emphasize higher-margin opportunities in data analytics and cloud computing, making more profit even if revenue continues to lag. Yet with so much intense competition in the cloud and big-data arenas, IBM will have to execute flawlessly if it wants to stay on track to meet its long-term financial goals.UnitedHealth Group fell 4%, with the health-insurance leader citing higher costs resulting from the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Although UnitedHealth saw gains in its Medicare Advantage and Medicaid enrollment, commercial-plan numbers dropped by 780,000, the company blamed health-care reform and government spending cuts for a $0.35 per share reduction in its earnings for the quarter. Still, UnitedHealth Group appears to be making the most of the opportunities under Obamacare, especially on the health-care services front. UnitedHealth's Optum segment saw revenue soar almost 30%, with its pharmacy benefits management unit OptumRx seeing even faster volume growth. It's hard to see those results as being gloomy, although it's uncertain whether Obamacare will continue to weigh on UnitedHealth earnings for the rest of 2014 and beyond.Even when stocks lose ground, it's important to look closely to figure out why. Often, temporary share-price drops are buying opportunities if you have a long-term perspective."
How IBM Plans to Win the Cloud Computing Market,"Jan 22, 2014 at 11:45AM","IBM (NYSE: IBM) has struggled in recent years with weak top-line performance, as corporations continue relying more on public cloud providers to reduce their IT budgets. After collecting more than $106 billion in annual revenue in 2011, the company has experienced no revenue growth.However, Big Blue is also well-known in the industry for being able to reinvent itself. The company sold its profitable PC business to Lenovo (NASDAQOTH: LNVGY) in 2004 to focus on software solutions and x86 servers. Lenovo then used IBM's hardware to become the world's largest PC manufacturer. Now, IBM may be interested in selling its low-end x86 server business, with Lenovo again as potential buyer. Once more, a new Big Blue is in the making. The new IBM is expected to be more focused on cloud computing, a space dominated by services such as Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services. But how does IBM plan to win market share in this highly competitive market?SOURCE: IBM INVESTOR RELATIONSThe cloud strategyIBM plans to invest more than $1.2 billion on as many as 15 new data centers across the world, as part of is strategy to expand its cloud services. With a clear focus on emerging markets in mind, the new cloud centers are to be located in Mexico City, China, Hong Kong, and India, among other places.With this investment, IBM plans to double cloud capacity for SoftLayer, a dedicated server, managed-hosting and cloud-computing provider that Big Blue acquired last year for $2 billion.By increasing its number of centers to 40, Big Blue plans to continue capturing more market share in the promising cloud market, which is expected to reach $200 billion in worldwide revenue by 2020, according to the company's forecast. Note that since Big Blue acquired SoftLayer, it has gained 2,400 new clients.Addressing every segment of the marketIBM's cloud strategy has two components. First, the company plans to target price-sensitive customers who are willing to use public cloud to keep IT costs low.This is an emerging market segment, dominated by Amazon Web Services, or AWS, an efficient cloud server farm popular with web developers due to its low price, simplicity, scalability, and efficiency. A promising business unit among Amazon, the price of AWS has been lowered more than 30 times since launching in 2006. Macquarie Securities estimates that the division's contribution to total revenue was roughly $2 billion in 2012. They expect this figure to jump to $5.9 billion in 2014.The acquisition of SoftLayer and recent investments in data-center expansion should provide Big Blue with enough tools to compete against AWS. SoftLayer has a complete portfolio of hosting and cloud solutions, with a particular focus on providing services to small and medium businesses. For example, SoftLayer's CloudLayer service allows customers to deploy their own virtual cloud servers for as low as $50 per month. Each cloud server is based on 2.0 GHz processors, and can be deployed in less than five minutes. The good news is that Big Blue also plans to continue addressing the needs of governmental institutions and big corporations. As IBM executive John Kelly explained at the 2013 Credit Suisse Technology Conference, all of the big databases of banks and retailers have historically resided in private data centers.There will always be a place for expensive mainframe computing in the tech world. This is because certain customers need high standards of security to do their business. For them, public cloud isn't an option. And in case some of these clients decide to migrate to private cloud systems, IBM is probably the only company around that can provide a smooth transition between mainframe technology and the private cloud. Final Foolish takeawayIBM's cloud strategy looks promising. Data-center expansion and the acquisition of SoftLayer, which offers public cloud virtual servers for as little as $50 per month, will allow Big Blue to capture market share in the promising public cloud segment. At the same time, the company will continue providing mainframe and private cloud solutions to institutional clients.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Why IBM Is Selling Its Server Business to Lenovo,"Jan 27, 2014 at 8:30PM","The world's largest PC manufacturer, Chinese technology company Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY), will pay $2 billion in cash and $300 million in stock to acquire IBM's (NYSE:IBM) x86 low-end server business, also known as System X.This is not the first time Lenovo acquired a business unit from Big Blue. In 2005, the company acquired IBM's ThinkPad line of PCs. The company eventually ended up becoming the biggest player in the PC arena. A shrinking PC industry was no impediment for Lenovo to establish a profitable PC business, helped by economies of scale and high quality standards in manufacturing. Lenovo posted a 36% hike in profits last November, but Lenovo wants more. It aims to conquer the smartphone space, and now, the low-end server market.IBM winsOverall, the latest acquisition seems to be a win-win situation for both Lenovo and IBM. Big Blue's low-end server business has been shrinking for a while, hurting the company's bottom line. This move also reduces IBM's dependency on hardware significantly. That's exactly what the company wants. Big Blue's new business priorities in its 2015 road map are cloud computing, Smarter Planet, business analytics, and growth markets. Moreover, between 2010 and 2013, the company spent roughly $12 billion in acquisitions, buying mainly software companies in the cloud space. There will always be a place for hardwareNote that although IBM is emphasizing software nowadays, the company is not retiring completely from the server world. It plans to stay in the high-end server and mainframe business, focusing on its System Z and Power lines, together with its storage systems.In other words, Big Blue is basically selling the low-margin, high-volume segment. This is consistent with IBM's new strategy, which focuses on high-margin software sales, and using mainframe and System Z technologies as a way to cross-sell its recurrent service and profitable support contracts.Apart from getting $2 billion in cash, IBM will have permission to continue selling System X servers as a reseller partner for Lenovo. Unlike System Z -- mainframe servers for large corporations -- IBM's System X portfolio of servers was basically targeted at mid-sized corporations, hosting companies, and clients with small cloud needs.Lenovo wins, Hewlett-Packard losesThe recent acquisition puts Lenovo in a better position to compete against Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Dell in the server market.Hewlett-Packard will now face a rival that isn't afraid of aggressive pricing to capture market share. In the third quarter of the past year, Hewlett-Packard had the largest share in the $9.5 billion low-end server market, according to IDC.This could change dramatically in the coming quarters, because the latest acquisition is expected to move Lenovo ahead five years in its plan to expand in servers, raising its global ranking among suppliers from No. 6 to No. 3, according to Peter Hortensius, senior vice president at Lenovo. Final Foolish takeawayThe acquisition of IBM's low-end server business by Lenovo may be a win-win situation. IBM, which reported its seventh straight quarter of declining revenue last week, is trying to reinvent itself once more by focusing on high-growth areas, such as cloud computing and software.The deal will also give Lenovo about 12% of the world's server market. Although the acquired business unit is barely profitable, by increasing sales volume, Lenovo could transform IBM's low-end server unit into a cash-flow machine, as the company is well-known for using an aggressive pricing strategy combined with high-quality quality control to successfully capture market share.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Which Tech Company Is the Most Dangerous Competitor in America?,"Mar 2, 2014 at 11:00AM","The tech industry has always been brutally competitive. Companies can grow to multibillion-dollar valuations on the back of a brilliant new breakthrough, only to lose it all in the span of a few years as powerful foes rush in with slightly superior alternatives at bargain-basement prices.The world's top tech companies are well aware of this constant challenge, and they're not shy about pointing out exactly which of their competitors pose the greatest threats. A couple of months ago, Bloomberg dug into the 10-K filings of the 50 largest tech companies on U.S. exchanges to find out which of them are most often mentioned in the ""risk factors and competition"" section -- you know, that wall of text many investors scroll past to get to the juicy financial details. You might be very surprised by which companies appear most frequently, so read on to discover the most dangerous companies in tech, or just scroll down to find the full top-10 rankings with additional data.10th through fifth placeThere were several ties in the latter half of this top-10 list, so we actually wind up with two 10th-place finishers, two eighth-place finishers, and two fifth-place finishers.Amazon.com and Cisco tied for 10th place on Bloomberg's most-dangerous list, with eight mentions apiece in the 50 largest tech companies' 10-Ks. Amazon's ranking seems surprisingly low, since it's a dominant force in both e-commerce and cloud computing, two of the most important elements of the modern Internet economy. Amazon has also expanded into streaming video, and has a payment-processing system in the works as well. Cisco, on the other hand, is the undisputed leader in networking equipment, which it's leveraged to build share in online security tools and business communications as well. That puts it in the crosshairs of several large antivirus makers, but it's not the only networking specialist with a monster market cap, either.Intel and recent leveraged-buyout target Dell tie for eighth place with nine out of 50 mentions each. Intel's placement is obvious -- as the world's largest chip maker, it's in direct competition with virtually every other major chip maker, and its ownership of security software maker McAfee puts it in the crosshairs of every major antivirus-software company as well. Computer maker Dell is a perennial threat to other large hardware companies, and its belated efforts to expand into software and enterprise solutions expands its list of domestic opponents dramatically.Samsung places seventh, with 11 call-outs from America's 50 largest tech companies. As one of the world's largest and most diversified electronics companies, Samsung not only makes smartphones and TVs, it also manufactures many of the chips that control the world's devices.SOURCE: ED FAVILA VIA FLICKR.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google tie for fifth place with 12 mentions apiece. Both companies compete in many of the same sectors of the tech world, including mobile (iOS and Android) and desktop computing (Macs and Chromebooks). Apple's integrated ecosystem threatens both hardware and software companies, while Google's reliance on data-driven advertising and its ownership of YouTube makes it a threat to major content- and media-focused tech companies. This ranking seems low for both companies, but more so for Google, which has a hand in so many parts of the tech ecosystem that it should surely threaten a wider range of competitors.Fourth place: OracleDatabase-software specialist Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) gets singled out by 13 of America's 50 largest tech companies as a major threat. Surprisingly, companies in segments as divergent as security software and data analytics think Oracle is dangerous -- but since Oracle is the second-largest software company by revenue in the world and boasts 400,000 customers worldwide, it probably has more competitors than it's even fully aware of -- and some of them might be using its programming tools to challenge other top tech companies as well. Oracle also offers a wide range of cloud-computing applications and platforms as well as a line of server hardware.SOURCE: DON DEBOLD VIA FLICKR.Third place: Hewlett-PackardPC and printer kingpin Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) competes with 15 of America's 50 largest tech companies in a wide range of hardware categories -- it also makes servers, smartphones (though it's unlikely that these are actually ""competing"" with anyone right now), and networking hardware -- and has also been steadily growing its software segment under current CEO Meg Whitman. HP competes with nearly every other company already on this list, and as its enterprise software and services efforts intensify, it's likely to come into the crosshairs of companies that might not have imagined having to fend off HP five or 10 years ago.Second place: MicrosoftWith 16 mentions from America's 50 largest tech companies -- a third of the list -- Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) claims second place on our most-dangerous list. Its operating system dominance is obviously a challenge to Apple. Its expansion into search got Google riled up. Its leadership in the game-console market (not to mention its game-development studio) worries game publishers. Its push into cloud computing makes Amazon and Oracle direct competitors. And now that it's got its own mobile-device manufacturer in Nokia's hardware segment, Microsoft is bound to find new challengers waiting for it in 2014.SOURCE: ALFRED LUI VIA FLICKR.America's most dangerous tech company: IBMAfter working our way through a list of industry leaders, it may be surprising that IBM (NYSE:IBM) worries more of its peers than any other tech company. With 18 mentions out of the top 50 tech companies, IBM is clearly a big threat, but why? Bloomberg points out that IBM's business-services focus has given it an inside track to IT departments in many of the world's largest companies, which has been a popular avenue of growth for companies ranging from HP to Cisco.IBM's leadership in the nascent Big Data field, and its development of artificial intelligence systems such as Watson, also make it dangerous to a number of analytics-driven tech companies. IBM is also by far the most prolific patent hoarder in America, which can make it dangerous even when it's not trying to challenge anyone directly. However, it's possible that IBM's rank will slip next year, since it recently sold off its server-hardware segment, which was one of the world's largest server vendors in 2013.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

How IBM Plans to Make Money From Supercomputers,"Jan 13, 2014 at 11:16AM","IBM's (NYSE:IBM) recent stock performance has been disappointing. Big Blue delivered a negative 3% return in the past 12 months. A huge name in the tech world, IBM is famous not only for having a presence in every major tech segment, from large hardware to services, but also for its capacity to reinvent itself. For example, the company sold its profitable PC business to Lenovo in 2004 to focus on software solutions.However, in the past few quarters, Big Blue and other traditional tech players -- such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) -- had a difficult time trying to improve top-line performance. In particular, as institutional clients continue cutting tech budgets -- and relying more on public cloud providers -- it's getting harder for IBM to continue selling private cloud solutions. To improve revenue, the company plans to invest in emerging technology and create new markets. An example is IBM's Watson supercomputer, which could bring in $10 billion in revenue within 10 years. But how exactly does IBM plan to make money from selling supercomputers?SOURCE: IBM CORPORATE WEBSITE.The Watson supercomputerIBM's Watson is an artificially intelligent computer system capable of answering questions in natural language. The supercomputer became famous after winning the first prize of $1 million on ""Jeopardy!,"" after having access to more than 200 million pages of content, including the full text of Wikipedia. The system is also able to carry out hypothesis generation. Moreover, it can learn from its past mistakes, and therefore get smarter with each iteration.It's no sci-fi, it's just businessThis may sound like a sci-fi movie.But the Watson supercomputer has been developed with a clear business focus in mind. For example, after IBM's engineers managed to shrink Watson from the size of a bedroom to a pizza-box sized computer, Big Blue got its first piece of business by renting Watson to hospitals and health-care networks.As Forbes contributor Bruce Upbin notes, IBM struck a 2012 deal with Memorial Sloan Kettering to use Watson for analyzing thousands of cancer-patient records in order to provide full evidence-based treatment decisions. The supercomputer was programmed in such a way that it doesn't tell doctors what to do. Instead, it provides several options with various degrees of confidence, so doctors can make the final decision.Watson and its financial applicationsThe supercomputer could also generate meaningful sales in the financial field, where the capacity of processing large amounts of information in short time is highly appreciated.Reuters alone is believed to publish more than 9,000 pages of financial news every day. Watson could process all this information, including data about transactions, emails, and research documents, to suggest optimal investment decisions. Singapore-based DBS Group Holdings plans to begin using Watson to help financial planners in wealth management provide more customized service.Investing in the futureIBM seems confident about the technology behind Watson. The company wants to improve sales and execution. That's why Big Blue recently announced it plans to invest more than $1 billion to establish a new business unit for Watson. The plan is to boost the headcount at Watson Group to around 2,000. Most of the new recruits may be salespeople and consultants.Foolish bottom lineLast year was a tough year for traditional tech players. To continue growing, the key is to focus on emerging technologies with the ability of creating new markets.Oracle, a leader in database technology, initially suffered from poor sales of its applications businesses. In response, the software maker has been rolling out its own cloud-based products. Likewise, Intel, which missed the smartphone revolution, recently announced its x86 Pentium-class Edison wearable computer. And as the Watson project shows, IBM is also innovating and searching for new markets. Watson's ability to answer questions in natural language, its several business applications, and the upcoming increase in sales employees should help Big Blue to capitalize on supercomputers.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

IBM and Facebook are the Main Reasons the S&P 500 is Beating the Dow This Year,"May 23, 2014 at 12:05PM","Markets are heading higher today, but only one of America's two most-watched indexes is pushing toward uncharted territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) at lunchtime remained more than 100 points below the all-time high close of 16,715 points it reached on May 13, but the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) was closing in on 1,900 points for the first time ever.^GSPC DATA BY YCHARTS.The S&P has gained 5% more than the Dow over the past decade. Much of that outperformance came in the past year, when the broader index surged nearly 15% compared to a more modest 8.5% gain in its blue-chip counterpart.^GSPC DATA BY YCHARTS.This outperformance vanishes on earlier timelines, as the Dow actually held up better than the more-diverse S&P 500 in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble.^GSPC DATA BY YCHARTS.There's an easy explanation for this discrepancy, as the fortunes of both indices have depended in different degrees on the fortunes of the tech industry. The S&P currently boasts 70 ""technology"" companies, according to Finviz, while six of the Dow's 30 components are in the tech sector. The Dow should weight its tech companies more heavily, but that's not the case, as its price-weighting scheme penalizes the lower-priced shares of most of its tech components, resulting in a rather weak 13.9% weighting.The S&P's 70 tech companies, on the other hand, are weighted by the size of their market cap, and that gives them a larger share of the pie, with a total weighting of 17.5%. Finviz actually underrepresents the tech industry in its categorization, since Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is counted as a consumer goods company despite clearly being part of the Silicon Valley elite. Adding four of the larger tech companies miscategorized in Finviz boosts the industry's weight on the S&P to 22%, which is nearly twice that sector's weighting on the Dow. While only one tech component -- IBM (NYSE:IBM) -- is among the Dow's five most heavily weighted, the S&P has eight tech companies ranked among its 20 largest, and those eight components alone account for 12.25% of the S&P's total weight.AAPL DATA BY YCHARTS.Apple was the S&P's heavy-hitter until its peak in 2012, but Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has taken the lead as index superstar over the past year. Its current weighting of roughly 0.9% means that its 143% rise during that period has been worth over 1% in gains for the S&P, more than offsetting the weakness in IBM shares. IBM accounts for roughly 1.1% of the S&P's daily movements, but over 7% of the Dow's. Since IBM is the only one of the S&P's biggest tech components to underperform the index itself over the past year, it's easy to see why the Dow has underperformed relative to its more diverse counterpart. Relying too heavily on a few high-priced megacaps has left it vulnerable to a single company's weaknesses in ways the S&P is not.If the Dow dawdles while the S&P cracks 1,900 points and keeps pushing higher, it may very well be because one index tracks a broader range of large-cap outperformers in a hot sector, while the other relies on the few weak spots in that sector for much of its momentum.10 better buys than the Dow Jones Industrial AverageWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

"Here's What You Don't Know About Microsoft, Today's Best Dow Stock","Mar 18, 2014 at 4:32PM","The market breathed a sigh of relief today as the situation in Crimea remained calm even after Russia said it would formally annex the region whose residents voted overwhelmingly Sunday to secede from Ukraine. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) quickly nudged higher after the opening bell and maintained moderate gains.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) held a comfortable lead over the other 29 other Dow components for the day. The world's largest software-maker is getting a boost from reports that it will roll out a version of its Office productivity suite for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad later this month. Microsoft's expansion onto Apple's mobile devices continues to close the circle that began way back in 1977 when Microsoft launched one of its earliest commercial software programs, Applesoft BASIC, a program compiler that allowed Apple II users to create more robust programs than they might have with the system's default software.SOURCE: JOI ITO VIA FLICKR.You probably didn't know that Microsoft's early successes were built on Apple computers before the IBM (NYSE:IBM) PC hit the market in 1981. You might be surprised at how little of Microsoft's history you're familiar with. For example, did you know...Microsoft was founded in 1975 in Albuquerque, N.M. -- famed for being the place where Bugs Bunny should have made a left turn and for being the backdrop of Breaking Bad -- and didn't move to Washington state until 1979.Co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen set up shop in Albuquerque (as Micro-Soft, which became Microsoft in 1981) to develop and sell a BASIC interpreter for the MITS Altair 8800, which is widely considered the first true microcomputer and the spark that launched the microcomputer (and later the PC) revolution. Both Microsoft and Apple were formed as a result of their founders' keen interest in the Altair 8800.Microsoft generated roughly $19,000 a year in revenue (equal to about $78,000 today) for its first two years in operation while focusing on supporting the Altair 8800. When the first PC ""trinity"" (the Apple II, the TRS-80, and the Commodore PET) launched in 1977, Microsoft's revenue exploded to $380,000 as the company began offering BASIC for these new machines. In 1978, Microsoft sold more than $1 million worth of software for the first time.Microsoft's trailing 12-month revenue of $83.4 billion for 2013 is more than 520 million percent greater than its 1975 annual revenue of just $16,000.Microsoft actually released an operating system before MS-DOS. Called Xenix, this OS was a Unix variant, licensed from AT&T (NYSE:T) and launched in 1980. Xenix was largely abandoned after the AT&T antitrust breakup in 1984, which pushed post-breakup AT&T to sell Unix itself. By this point, however, Microsoft was firmly established with an operating system that would help it become the largest software company in the world.The OS deal between IBM and Microsoft that created MS-DOS nearly didn't happen. MS-DOS  is based on an earlier OS called CP/M, which IBM attempted to license from creators Digital Research after Gates directed IBM negotiators there. The negotiators were rebuffed when company head Gary Kildall demanded per-use royalties instead of the flat license fee IBM wanted. IBM, familiar with Microsoft's OS work thanks to a Microsoft hardware plug-in card that let users run CP/M on Apple IIs, returned to Gates with a request for an operating system. Gates discovered a CP/M variant called QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System) designed to run on the chips in IBM's upcoming PC, and purportedly paid $75,000  for its rights. IBM wound up using both CP/M and MS-DOS  (which was rebranded as PC-DOS for exclusive use on IBM machines), but by pricing Microsoft's product at $40 against $240 for CP/M, IBM ensured that budget-conscious consumers would adopt MS-DOS as the standard.Microsoft's deal with IBM wasn't particularly profitable at first. The two companies agreed to the one-time license fee IBM had originally wanted to pay for CP/M, and Gates himself later estimated that PC-DOS (the IBM-exclusive variant) only brought in about $186,000 in revenue. However, since Microsoft retained the rights to its own DOS variant, MS-DOS, it was free to charge per-use license fees to other manufacturers and to individual consumers, which it began to do in 1983 after originally offering MS-DOS for a flat one-time license fee of just $95,000 to PC-clone manufacturers. MS-DOS was still the most popular computer OS a decade later -- although many installations were bundled with early versions of Windows -- and Microsoft earned $399 million in sales from MS-DOS in 1992 alone. MS-DOS was finally discontinued in 2000 after nearly two decades of support.SOURCE: BEN FRANSKE VIA WIKIMEDIA COMMONS.Don't feel too bad for QDOS creator Tim Paterson for selling out at such a low price. He also came to work for Microsoft as part of that purchase, and was awarded a number of pre-IPO stock options. Feel bad for Paterson because he didn't recognize the value of those options -- he drifted in and out of the company before returning for good in 1990, but his early options (worth about $30 million in 1997) were never exercised. Cofounder Paul Allen left the company in 1983 after successfully battling Hodgkin's lymphoma. The end of Allen and Gates' professional relationship was contentious -- Gates had begun plotting to dilute Allen's stake  as a result of his ""lack of production,"" which understandably angered a recently recovered Allen. Gates offered to buy out Allen's stake at $5 a share. Those shares were worth more than $11,000  apiece three decades after Allen resigned, but Allen had originally wanted just $10 each! It's a good thing for him that Gates was so conservative in 1983. However, if Gates had bought Allen out, it's possible that his net worth might have topped out at nearly $200 billion (assuming that his combined ownership of 88% of the company  from that hypothetical 1983 buyout would have been diluted at the same rate as his actual 1983 stake of 53%).Microsoft released Windows 1.0, its first graphical OS, in 1985. However, Windows didn't become the company's most popular operating system until after the launch of Windows 3.0 in 1990, which was greatly aided by Microsoft's ability to get most PC manufacturers to pre-install before consumers got their hands on the newest machines.Windows became the target of a major copyright-infringement lawsuit in the 1990s, as Apple sued for billions of dollars in damages over the belief that Microsoft had copied the ""look and feel"" of the Macintosh OS. Apple lost the case, and this crushing legal defeat might have influenced Apple to focus more intently on patent rights and legal defenses -- its more recent ""look and feel"" lawsuits have seen more success in American courts.Microsoft's 1986 IPO set an initial market cap of about $780 million on the software maker. The company topped out at a market cap 790 times larger at the end of the dot-com boom. In 1999 alone, some 8,000 Microsoft employees  cashed in $8 billion worth of options. All told, at least 10,000  Microsoft employees became millionaires from their stock holdings.Microsoft became the world's most valuable publicly traded company in 1998, and it still holds the title of ""World's Most Valuable Public Company"" when adjusting for inflation. Its peak market cap of $616 billion, reached at the end of 1999, would be equal to about $860 billion today.Ever since Microsoft joined the Dow when it was close to its all-time peak market cap, it has underperformed the index -- but dividend payments have been the difference between a decline and a net gain over that time frame:MSFT TOTAL RETURN PRICE DATA BY YCHARTS.10 better buys than the Dow Jones Industrial AverageWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

"Pegasystems Looks Good, but Not Great","Mar 6, 2014 at 2:00AM","The enterprise software landscape is dominated by giants like SAP (NYSE:SAP), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) with annual revenues of $22 billion, $99 billion, and $37 billion, respectively . Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA) is surprisingly competitive despite its annual revenue of only $508 million. It wins business with major government agencies as well as top tier clients like Bank of America, Cisco, and American Express.Pegasystems' advantage is the customizability and ease of use its software provides. It enables easier business process integration due to its unique approach to client application development. Other solutions usually require the client to restructure at least some business processes prior to or during implementation. Pegasystems allows the client to create enterprise applications directly from their existing business process designs, which is a major short-term cost advantage for clients.Performance snapshotPegasystems' revenue has grown at an average rate of 18% over the last four years . Software license agreement revenue increased 17% from last year, and maintenance revenue is up 18% year over year , which should continue to increase along with new licensing. However, service revenue is down 3%, mostly from a decrease in demand for consulting services due to an increase in partnerships with consulting firms who act as integrators.There are also significant increases in expected revenue in the pipeline. Term license contracts on average are scheduled to bring in 44% more per year over the next five years compared to the five-year outlook last year . This could be due to Pegasystems' effectiveness at retaining clients since 80% of the value of new license agreements in 2013 came from existing customers. In 2012, that ratio was 74% .Competitive challengesThe main challenge Pegasystems faces is its size relative to major competitors. The resources available to other companies offering similar products are much greater, which leaves Pegasystems at a considerable disadvantage in sales and marketing, research and development, and service/consulting.SAP, IBM, and Oracle each spend more on research and development in one quarter than Pegasystems' total revenue from 2013 . With those R&D budgets, larger companies are developing technologies that are revolutionizing the industry such as SAP's HANA, IBM's PureData, and Oracle's Exadata products. As these new technologies gain momentum, and market share, Pegasystems will have to rely on its unique approach to application development, and its established footholds with major clients. Investing bottom linePegasystems will probably never compete at the same level as its bigger rivals, but it is growing and maintains some advantages over others in its field. In the next year it will be good to keep an eye on the percentage of growth from new customers. If that increases, be prepared to act on good entry points.If revenue from new customers becomes a smaller and smaller portion of overall revenue growth, it will signal that the resource gap between Pegasystems and its larger competitors is too great to be effectively countered by the narrow advantages Pegasystems provides. In this scenario it would most likely be a good time to exit some or all positions in the stock.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

"Child Genius, Space Rockets, and $7,093,435,498: Going Inside the Mind of Elon Musk","Feb 23, 2014 at 11:11AM","Visionary, calculating, determined, and self-confident are attributes used to describe Elon Musk, the outspoken mastermind behind PayPal, SpaceX, and Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA). Musk officially took to the world's stage in 2012, following the successful launch of his Falcon 9 rocket. After three failed launch attempts of the Falcon 1 rocket, the first Falcon 9 launch made history as it enabled the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft to later dock with the International Space Station. This made SpaceX the first privately held company to ever dock at the space station. A $1.6 billion contract with NASA followed.SOURCE: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS.However, privatizing space travel to the International Space Station is just one entry on Musk's laundry list of achievements. In fact, the South African-born entrepreneur hopes to one day make interplanetary travel a reality. ""I would like to die on Mars,"" he said in a Bloomberg interview, ""Just not on impact."" Musk is confident he can get a spacecraft to the planet in 10-15 years. These ambitious goals make his other plans, such as accelerating the shift to mass-market electric vehicles, seem like child's play. Nevertheless, Musk is leading the charge to widespread EV adoption as the chief executive of Tesla Motors.But we'll get back to that in a moment. First, let's take a more personal look at Musk the man.A young risk takerElon Musk, who is said to be the model for Robert Downey, Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark in the ""Iron Man"" films, is largely self-taught. Growing up, he was an avid reader who wasn't afraid to speak up when he knew the correct answer. His mother tells a story of when he was a boy and one of the kids said, ""Look at the moon, it's a billion miles away."" To which Elon responded, ""Well, no, it's actually under 250 thousand miles away.""Be it in business or life, Musk is always one step ahead of everyone else. When he was 10 years old, IBM tested him and found that he had one of the highest aptitudes they had ever seen for computer programming, according to a Bloomberg interview with his brother Kimbal Musk. Unfortunately, taking computer programming classes wasn't much help because he already new more than the teachers.Instead, a young Musk created a space game called Blastar, which he sold for a profit at age 12. This was the first of what would become many profitable ventures for Musk.A serial entrepreneurAfter earning engineering, physics, and business degrees from the University of Pennsylvania Musk was awarded a scholarship to attend Stanford. However, Musk decided he wanted to start an Internet company instead, and decided to put Stanford on hold. Together with his brother Kimbal, Musk wrote the software needed for his first company called Zip2. At the time, very few, if any, local businesses were using the Internet to connect with customers. However, that didn't deter the Musk brothers, and their Zip2 software became the first online city listing. In 1995, the they began pitching their technology to local businesses.ELON MUSK SPEAKING AT THE MOTLEY FOOL IN 2011.In an interview with Bloomberg, Kimbal recalls one instance when a potential customer threw the Yellow Pages at them and yelled, ""You think you'll ever replace this?"" Just four years later, at age 28, Musk sold Zip2 to Compaq for $307 million in cash and $34 million in stock options.His next big achievement came in 2002 when eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) purchased PayPal, an Internet payment system that Musk co-founded, for $1.5 billion. This proved critical to Musk's later accomplishments, as he used the $165 million or so that he received from the eBay deal to fund his other projects: Tesla Motors and SpaceX.The Internet, sustainable energy, and making life multi-planetary are the things that Musk thought would most affect humanity. Not surprisingly, he's leaving his mark on all three of those areas today.Changing the worldAs the CEO of both Tesla Motors, and SpaceX, Musk is no stranger to 100-hour workweeks. It's because of this hard work that Musk has accomplished so much. He's currently reenergizing the automotive industry through Tesla, a company that makes and builds all-electric cars. After a messy divorce with his first wife, Justine Musk, he invested his last $35 million in Tesla to help save the company from bankruptcy.SOURCE: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS.Not only was he able to save the company from near-failure, but also catapult Tesla to success as the world's first luxury EV maker. Tesla went from being the most shorted stock on the Nasdaq in 2011, to one of the best-performing stocks in 2013. During that time, shares climbed in value from around $27 apiece to where they trade today near $200 per share.""For me it was never about money, but solving problems for the future of humanity,"" Musk told Smithsonian magazine. Yet that hasn't stopped him from achieving a net worth today that is north of $7 billion. Still, Musk is sticking to his master plan for Tesla, which includes four straightforward steps:Build a sports car.Use that money to build an affordable car.Use that money to build an even more affordable car.While doing above, also provide zero-emission electric power generation options.His plan is succeeding, and Tesla is now on track to deliver its ""even more affordable car,"" the Model X, by year's end. However, Tesla is only part of the sustainable energy story. Musk is also heavily involved in SolarCity (NASDAQ:SCTY), a company that installs solar panels and helps customers finance them.Lighting the wayOn a road trip to Burning Man in 2005, Musk convinced his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive to start a solar company. With financial backing from Musk, the Rive brothers launched SolarCity. Today, SolarCity is the leading residential and commercial solar installer in the United States. The company's stock has also appreciated in value, up more than 349% in the last year. That bodes particularly well for Musk, as he's currently a majority shareholder in SolarCity.SOURCE: TESLA MOTORS.Moreover, in addition to Musk's position as chairman of SolarCity's board, he's also working closely with his cousins on a new partnership between SolarCity and Tesla Motors. In December, Tesla agreed to supply lithium-ion batteries for use in SolarCity's new solar-powered-storage system. The technology behind this industrial-grade energy storage is impressive because it helps solar customers save money by automatically using stored energy during peak hours when utility companies charge the highest rates.Given the nature of Tesla Motors and SolarCity, as well as the family ties, there's a good chance we'll see these companies work together on similar projects in the future. ""To get to a sustainable energy future, we must have both sustainable energy creation and consumption, so SolarCity is about sustainable energy creation and Tesla is about sustainable energy consumption,"" Musk told Bloomberg.OnwardWith both companies marching forward and pushing the bounds of innovation today, there are few obstacles Musk has not been able to overcome. Moreover, he is revolutionizing the sustainable energy industry, as well as space exploration, in ways that others once considered impossible. SpaceX, SolarCity, and Tesla Motors all owe their current success to Elon Musk. With Musk leading these businesses forward, it will be interesting to see what the future holds.Should eBay be on your buy list?

You Probably Didn't Know This About International Business Machines Corp. Dividends,"May 9, 2014 at 2:00PM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) pays a lot of attention to its dividend. Over the last 10 years, Big Blue has increased its quarterly payouts by 510%. Every Dow Jones (DJINDICES:^DJI) component pays a dividend nowadays, but few can match IBM's commitment to giving back to shareholders.The company's stock price doubled over the same period, taking some of the bite out of IBM's dividend yield. But a share price that rises too quickly is a nice problem to have.IBM DATA BY YCHARTS.However, IBM shares are not all wine and roses for income investors. Those payout boosts didn't come easy.The rising dividend payouts represent a growing portion of IBM's free cash flow. The intertwined lines on this next chart are almost eerie:IBM CASH DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIO (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.Big Blue has a long history of generous dividend improvements, matched by an even larger dose of share buybacks. Since 2000, the company has spent $30 billion on dividend checks and $108 billion on share repurchases.At times, the company has even borrowed money just to light a bigger fire under these shareholder-friendly policies. In the second quarter of 2007, IBM took out a massive $12 billion debt load (on top of its existing $23 billion in long-term debt) only to dump all the proceeds into buybacks. At no point did IBM's buybacks force it to slow down its dividend payments or even the pace of payout growth.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Now, the second chart above isn't exactly terrifying. IBM's cash payout ratio is rising, but it still has plenty of headroom for future increases.That might mean slowing down those sprightly buyback plans, though -- or maybe taking on even more debt to keep the two parties going. Over the last four quarters, IBM spent $18.4 billion on buybacks and $4.1 billion on dividends, exceeding the $12.5 billion in free cash flow. That means dipping into cash reserves or other capital sources.IBM isn't likely to slow down its dividend growth anytime soon, but the buybacks might need a breather. Keep that in mind if you were hoping for a huge buyback benefit over the next few years."
IBM Rockets the Dow Higher in Monday Trading,"May 12, 2014 at 1:00PM","The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) had moved 91 points higher by 1 p.m. EDT, reaching an intraday record high amid broad-based buying. IBM (NYSE:IBM), the second-highest weighted stock in the Dow, was up 1.3%, among the largest blue-chip gainers by early afternoon. This move comes in front of the company's annual meeting this Wednesday and on the heels of a New York Times interview with CEO Ginni Rometty over the weekend.Where's the growth?IBM's growth has been the biggest concern for the investors over the past few years. Rometty specifically address this concern in her interview with the Times. To paraphrase, in the short term the CEO cares a whole lot more about profit than she does growth.This chart clearly supports her statement.IBM REVENUE (ANNUAL) DATA BY YCHARTS.But to focus on the short term is a mistake, and Rometty made that clear. IBM is once again transforming itself -- which is something of an ongoing tradition at the 100-year-old company.Her decisions today are not about this quarter or even this year, but about the next decade, and maybe even longer than that. And in this way the decline in revenue has been a short-term symptom of the company's long-term strategy.Since Rometty became CEO, IBM has sold businesses with combined annual revenue of over $6 billion annually. No matter how you slice it, that's a major hit to the top line -- even if it's on purpose!However, these sales have generated over $16 billion in cash, which Rometty is investing in the future of the company. That's the real narrative IBM investors should be watching.The IBM of the futureGone are the days of the narrow-margin hardware businesses at IBM. Rometty is betting the future of the company on higher-margin software and service businesses.The company is investing heavily in cloud technologies, with a stated goal to have 40 cloud data centers running in 15 countries by the end of 2014. IBM invested $1.2 billion to the project in January, only seven months after its $2 billion purchase of cloud tech start-up SoftLayer Technologies.And of course there is Watson, IBM's supercomputer and software system made famous by its dominant performance on the game show Jeopardy. Watson's potential is far greater than trivia, of course, with potentially revolutionary applications in science, medicine, finance, and more.Taking a step back, we can see the outline of IBM's long-term strategy. The company wants to enable a future of cloud-based technologies that drive the world around us. That technology collects an incomprehensible amount of data -- data that could be used to optimize and improve facets of life from air travel to oil pipelines to the temperature in your living room. That's a task that software like Watson would be perfectly suited to manage. It's about building better systems with better data, and then using that data to make the world an even better place.This transformation will be the focal message at IBM's annual meeting this week. Investing in a company that is in the middle of a major strategic change is a risky proposition -- but it could also present an opportunity to buy an incredible company on the cheap.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Warren Buffett: Working Hard or Hardly Working?,"Jan 23, 2014 at 5:15PM","""Lethargy bordering on sloth remains the cornerstone of our investment style,"" said investing titan Warren Buffett in his 1990 letter to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) shareholders. What could the Oracle of Omaha mean?An indolent investing styleBuffett likes to buy noncontrolling interests in great companies and watch them do the heavy lifting. As Buffett says of Berkshire's ""Big Four"" holdings -- Coca-Cola,(NYSE:KO), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and  American Express (NYSE:AXP):At Berkshire we much prefer owning a non-Controlling but substantial portion of a wonderful business to owning 100% of a so-so business.Our flexibility in capital allocation gives us a significant advantage over companies that limit themselves only to acquisitions they can operate.(NYSE:KO)(NYSE:KO)(NYSE:KO)(NYSE:KO)(NYSE:KO)(NYSE:KO)(NYSE:KO)(NYSE:KO)It also has a 50-year history of consecutive dividend increases (it currently yields 2.8%) and a 28-year history of share repurchases, fulfilling Buffett's three criteria.Buffett's favorite daily beverage may be Coca-Cola, but it represents a smaller stake than Berkshire's largest holding, Wells Fargo.Wells-Fargo has a dominant position, serving a third of U.S. households. Its conservative management style helped it maneuver through the financial crisis. Even through the crisis, Buffett kept buying Wells Fargo, fully expecting it to come through with flying colors.And Wells Fargo has come through for him, repurchasing $17 million in shares in its last quarter and almost doubling its yield from 2012 to 2.6%.Although IBM stock has been under pressure of late, Buffett doesn't mind, saying he won't be selling IBM, and furthermore: ""We should wish for IBM's stock price to languish throughout the five years.""Buffett's carefree attitude is based on his buyback calculus. Even if IBM stays flat, an $11.5 billion buyback  program, along with a 12% dividend increase, makes Buffett's current shares more valuable.And history proves more buybacks are likely: The company has returned more than $150 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The company has slashed its share count by a third in 14 years and paid a continuous dividend -- now yielding 2% -- since 1916.Buffett has owned a stake in American Express for almost 50 years. His original 5% stake has now grown to 13.7% of the company. Its high-visibility brand and strong customer loyalty give it a moat in the competitive financial-services sector.In 2013 the company announced a 150 million-share repurchase program adding up to $4.2 billion worth of shares in 2013 and early 2014. Since 2012 the company has started raising its dividend again after temporarily curtailing raises during the recession. The yield now stands at 1%.BRK.A TOTAL RETURN PRICE DATA BY YCHARTS.Making companies work for youOf these great companies, Buffett said in 2012:We expect the combined earnings of the four -- and their dividends as well -- to increase in 2012 and, for that matter, almost every year for a long time to come. A decade from now, our current holdings of the four companies might well account for earnings of $7 billion, of which $2 billion in dividends would come to us.Thanks partly to Buffett's laissez-faire stock thesis, Berkshire has a 19.7% compound annual book-value growth rate, having gone from $19 per class ""A"" share in 1964 to $126,766 per class ""A"" share as of Sept. 30, 2013.Warren long ago made his investments work for him by choosing companies carefully. The Big Four have done the hard work as Warren reaps dividends and capital appreciation from what they sow. Remember what Warren said:At bottom, we [Charlie Munger and Buffett] subscribe to Ronald Reagan's creed: ""It's probably true that hard work never killed anyone, but I figure why take the chance.""Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

5 Unusual Facts About the Dow Jones Industrial Average,"May 16, 2014 at 12:05PM","The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) is America's most-watched index, and it's given us a lot of insight into the changing U.S. economy over the years. In our ongoing quest to learn more about the Dow and its 30 members, we've examined the age of its components, the frequency of its changes, the value and financial strength of its representative companies, and the people who make these companies tick. Today we'll look at what the Dow might look like if it were built a little different. Let's dive right into a Dow chosen by market cap alone.1. Barely half of the Dow's components are among America's 30 most valuable companiesThe Dow is notable for focusing on well-established large-cap representatives of the American economy, but in the interest of balance it's had to trade off a bit. There are currently 18 Dow components among the 30 most valuable publicly traded companies on the market, with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) clinging to 30th place with a $130 billion market cap. While the other 17 top-30 components are fairly secure in their ranks for the moment, Intel has been battling neck and neck with Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) for that final spot for months, which means there might soon be only 17 Dow components on the top 30 list:INTC MARKET CAP DATA BY YCHARTS.2. Tech would be king if the Dow chose its components purely by market capAmerica's largest companies show a distinctly high-tech slant, as nine of the top 30 by market cap are technology companies -- at least if you count Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), which could also be credibly classified as a retailer. However, some sectors, particularly manufacturing, would find themselves with far lesser representation under this ""rebalancing."" Here's what the Dow's makeup looks like today, and what it would look like with a hypothetical 30-largest-companies composition:SectorNumber of Companies Included in the Dow TodayNumber of Companies of the 30 Largest on the MarketFinancial66Industrial41Technology and Telecoms612Energy22Health Care33Basic Materials20Retail and Consumer Goods76SOURCE: IWEBLISTS. All of the Dow's tech and telecom components are already among the top 30, but the addition of Amazon, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) would cost a half-dozen current components their spots. And while the financial sector maintains the same level of representation before and after this swap, it would wind up with four new components -- three megabanks and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) -- since only Visa (NYSE: V) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) have sufficiently hefty market caps to rank among America's 30 largest companies.SOURCE: EKOLIST VIA WIKIMEDIA COMMONS.3. Dow components' average age wouldn't change much if they were chosen by market capThe average Dow component was founded more than a century ago -- half of the Dow's 30 components trace their origins to the 19th century, and one (JPMorgan Chase) has its roots at the tail end of the 18th century, a mere few years after America's founding fathers won their war for independence. The average Dow company is 111 years old, but since so many of America's 30 largest companies are also Dow components, the average age of this elite group isn't much younger at 98 years old.The youngest of these megacap monsters is Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), which hasn't hit puberty yet at 10 years old, but dot-com juggernauts Amazon and Google also skew this size-based group younger with founding dates of 1994 and 1998, respectively.4. Tech would also be king if the Dow weighted its components by market capThere might be six tech and telecom companies in the Dow today, but the index's price-based weighting scheme punishes the sector with four of the six smallest weights out of all 30 components. However, things would look quite different if we simply weighted each component based on its market cap, especially since many of the Dow's financial representatives, which boast among the highest share prices of all 30 components, account for four of the eight smallest market caps in the Dow:SectorCurrent Dow WeightWeight by Current Market CapTrue Economic Weight*Financial27.6%12.6%7.6%Industrial14.6%11.1%7.6%Technology and Telecoms13.9%24.2%12%Energy8.3%14%5%Health Care7.2%13.1%8.2%Basic Materials7.8%3.2%5.3%Retail and Consumer Goods20.8%21.9%15%SOURCES: INDEXARB, IWEBLISTS, AND U.S. BUREAU OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS.* SECTOR WEIGHTED BY COMBINING ALL RELEVANT SUB-SECTORS AND RECALCULATING AS A PERCENTAGE OF PRIVATE GDP, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR 86.5% OF TOTAL U.S. GDP.5. Financial stocks are the kings of the Dow, but were the last to be addedThere were no financial stocks -- no banks, no insurance companies, and no credit card networks -- on the Dow until American Express (NYSE:AXP) was added in 1982. Today, six money-moving companies make up over a quarter of the Dow's entire value by weight, giving financials as much heft as the manufacturing and tech sectors combined. Two of the Dow's six financial components were added last year, and four of the six have joined since the Great Recession's bear market ended in 2009.You might think tech companies would be the most recent additions, but IBM (NYSE:IBM) has been part of the Dow since 1979, beating AmEx into the index by three years. IBM was actually a member of the Dow from 1932 to 1939 as well, so tech companies have several decades on the financial sector when it comes to representing America's economy."
The Money Behind The Masters,"Apr 11, 2014 at 7:58AM","Spring is officially here for golf fans, and the sport's most revered tournament, The Masters, has teed off for the 78th time. While talk of Tiger Woods' absence, Rory McIlroy's potential, and Augusta National's history is inevitable, there's another issue worth exploring: the economics of the tournament.The sponsor-to-TV switcherooIt all starts with the sponsors. Unlike most sporting events that are inundated with ads, The Masters limits the marketing opportunities available to corporate partners. Like most years, the tournament has just three primary sponsors in 2014: IBM (NYSE:IBM), AT&T (NYSE:T), and Daimler's (NASDAQOTH:DDAIF) Mercedes-Benz. Because Augusta restricts commercial time to a brief four minutes per hour, this trio is experimenting with new advertising strategies. IBM, for example, says it will show 50 different TV spots during the tournament. The campaign, ""Made With IBM,"" is comprised of mini-stories that illustrate the company's relationship with various clients. Mercedes is using its existing relationship with defending Masters champion Adam Scott on social media, and the automaker's cars are also being marketed on the golf course. MERCEDES-BENZ (@MERCEDESBENZ), TWITTER.AT&T, meanwhile, is introducing a new slogan, ""Mobilizing your world."" The phrase replaces the iconic ""Rethink possible,"" which the company had used since 2010.Although the terms of each sponsor's agreement aren't disclosed, IEG has calculated the total annual figure to be near $18 million in years past.And herein lies the switcheroo. IEG's Jim Andrews told Bloomberg Businessweek that after the tournament's broadcast partners -- Disney's (NYSE: DIS) ESPN and CBS (NYSE:CBS) -- estimate expenses, a curious process begins. ""Augusta then acts as a broker,"" the outlet says, ""arranging for the tournament's three official sponsors...to cover those costs."" It's unknown if either network makes money, but Andrews says they ""maybe make a little bit of a profit.""That doesn't mean ESPN and CBS aren't chomping at the bit to provide coverage, though. The Masters' unique combination of prestige and exposure is unmatched in the golfing world. It's the sport's most-watched event, and last year, it generated almost twice the level of television interest as the U.S. Open, and three times as many viewers as the British Open and PGA Championship.Don't forget about tickets and merchThis represents the other main chunk of change. Last week, I wrote, ""although Augusta doesn't share attendance information, most estimate The Masters averages close to 40,000 spectators per day."" Assuming average daily ticket prices are $1,000 -- a figure near what TiqIQ reports -- total ticket revenues are at least $160 million for the four-day tournament. And including the Monday through Wednesday practice rounds, when the course can hold 50,000 spectators at lower prices, another $50 million is likely made.Merchandise sales, by comparison, are harder to estimate because they're not disclosed publicly. Items available for purchase range from a $3 sandwich to a $175 belt, so assuming every patron spends a mere $10 per day, that's another $2 million to $3 million. Given that thousand-dollar tabs aren't uncommon -- Golf Channel's Jason Sobel just found one for over $5,000, for example -- my estimate could be on the small side.The bottom lineAt the end of the day, the relationship between sponsors and TV broadcasters is largely self-sustaining, and is worth a shade under $20 million a year. Tickets and merchandise sales are at least 10 times larger. And at over $200 million, the tournament's size -- from a revenue standpoint -- even rivals events like the NCAA Final Four and the MLB's All-Star Week.While Augusta National probably won't release its financials any time soon, it's clear a lot of money changes hands at The Masters."
Should IBM's POWER 8 Worry Intel?,"May 11, 2014 at 2:30PM","When it comes to server processors, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is by far the most financially successful. While Intel is well known for having the highest-performing microprocessors in the industry, this isn't strictly true. Indeed, if there is one company out there that builds bigger, hotter, and more powerful processors than Intel does for ultra-high end Unix servers, it's IBM (NYSE:IBM) with its POWER line of microprocessors. With IBM's recent launch of its POWER 8 processors, should Intel be worried?The power of POWER 8IBM's POWER 8 is truly a technical tour de force:SOURCE: IBM.The POWER 8 CPU core is extremely wide, clocks quite high, and offers what seems to be unmatched single-threaded performance. In fact, if we look at performance results of a system packing four of the six core variants of the POWER 8 clocked at 3.52 GHz, and compare it ith a system packing four of Intel's most recently launched Xeon E7-4890 v2 (codenamed Ivy Bridge-EX), IBM's solution compares quite favorably on a per-core basis.The four-socket Xeon E7-4890 (which packs 60 Ivy Bridge CPU cores clocked at 2.8 GHz) scores 138,900 SAPS (higher is better) while the four-socket POWER 8 (which packs 24 CPU cores clocked at 3.52 GHz) scores 115,870 SAPS. The Intel system offers greater performance, but on a per-core basis the IBM is much more powerful. Also, from a more geeky technical perspective, the IBM CPU is much wider, the chip has significantly more cache, and it offers much higher memory bandwidth than the Intel chip.Great, IBM's POWER 8 is a beast. So what?While the performance of the IBM POWER 8 is not at all in question (this is a magnificent piece of engineering), this has never actually been a problem for IBM's POWER line of processors. The POWER 7 was a much beefier and powerful processor relative to its Intel Xeon competition, yet Intel has continued to gain share in the overall server processor market. So what are the important questions investors need to ask about POWER 8?Intel's success has never just been due to performance leadership; a 6-core POWER 8 about matches a 15-core Intel Xeon, and the 12-core variant of the POWER 8 would utterly embarrass it in performance. The problem for IBM is that the equation for data-center dominance isn't simply about performance, but is instead about performance per watt per dollar. While it's too soon to get a read on the performance per watt of the IBM POWER 8 (although it's likely that this kind of performance doesn't come cheaply), the real problem that is likely to plague it is the cost.IBM doesn't have Intel's scaleThe POWER 8 is built on IBM's custom 22-nanometer SOI process (finely tuned for high-performance CPUs) using 15 metal layers and weighing in at a hefty 650-square-millimeter die size. Further, note that the volumes of this processor are likely extremely low and, in case you haven't been following IBM's financial statements, the sales of systems using these processors continue to plummet. On top of that, given that this is quite a large, exotic design, yields may still be difficult (but for what machines based on this chip sell for, IBM can afford it).IBM'S SYSTEMS & TECHNOLOGY GROUP CONTINUES TO BLEED OUT. SOURCE: IBM. On the other hand, Intel's Xeon E7 (Ivy Bridge-EX) is a 4.31 billion-transistor machine weighing in at 541 square millimeters built on a quite mature 22-nanometer FinFET process in factories that have to date pumped out hundreds of millions of 22-nanometer FinFET processors. While the volumes on this part are low, and while yields on this chip are almost assuredly trickier than a 1.4 billion-transistor Haswell notebook CPU, they are probably better than the IBM POWER 8's at this stage of the game.In short, even if the performance per watt is better than or equal to Intel's, Intel is likely to be able to offer its product much more cheaply as a result of the massive design leverage, as well as the manufacturing leverage it gets from its PC chip and other segments of its server business.Foolish bottom lineA big round of applause for IBM's technical teams in executing one of the most interesting and exotic processors on the planet today. While IBM appears to hope for a better future for POWER by opening up the architecture and designs for third-party licensing via its OpenPOWER initiative, the markets that IBM's niche high-end servers that it builds POWER for are still very difficult and not getting any easier.The key things to watch for:Licensing uptake with OpenPOWER.IBM POWER server sales as POWER 8 systems ramp.If neither of these points to renewed signs of life for POWER, then the fate of these technically beautiful POWER processors may be sealed and Intel will have nothing to worry about. If, on the other hand, OpenPOWER gets POWER 8 into more markets, then Intel may indeed have something to worry about.

Is IBM One of the Best Companies in America?,"Sep 22, 2014 at 9:53AM","In partnership with Glassdoor, our investment analysts are taking a closer look at some of the most popular companies in Glassdoor's career community. IBM (NYSE:IBM) remains a household name in technology even after spinning off or selling many of its consumer-facing businesses. In fact, Big Blue took No. 4 in Interbrand's 2013 listing of Best Global Brands, putting it just behind Apple, Google, and Coca-Cola.However, despite IBM being an extremely profitable company, the investment community isn't too hot on the stock: shares trade at just over 12 times trailing 12-month earnings. One widely held explanation for IBM's submarket multiple is that the company is having a difficult time reigniting revenue growth.Nevertheless, with a powerful brand and nearly $100 billion in revenue last year, it's worth asking if IBM is one of America's best companies.IBM's performance as an investment requires perspectiveYear to date, IBM shares are up just 2.26%, while the S&P 500 has risen 7.35%. Over the last year, IBM is actually down 0.19% against an S&P that has soared 17.53%.IBM investors who got in fairly recently probably aren't all that happy with the performance in the share price. But that doesn't mean IBM isn't trying to make its stock as appealing as possible. In October 2013, the company announced that its board of directors had added another $15 billion to its share repurchase program, raising the total authorization at the time to $20.6 billion. The press release also noted the company ""expects to request additional share repurchase authorization at the October 2014 board meeting.""IBM has also made it clear that it wants to continue to drive earnings-per-share growth despite a difficult revenue growth story via cost-cutting, share repurchases, and a shift to higher-margin businesses. The good news is that IBM has a pretty good shot of reaching its sought-after $20 per share in 2015 earnings; however, absent meaningful revenue growth, the company's stock might continue to trade for a low earnings multiple.Still, keep in mind that growing sales off of a nearly $100 billion baseline isn't exactly a walk in the park.Are ""IBMers"" happy?According to Glassdoor, out of 11,562 respondents, IBM received an overall average rating of 3.1 out of five stars. Fifty-four percent of respondents would recommend the company to a friend, while only 50% of 3,553 respondents approve of CEO Virginia Rometty.Let's look more closely at the breakdown of the ratings:Overall (IBM)Culture and ValuesWork/Life BalanceSenior ManagementComp & BenefitsCareer Opportunities3.13.13.32.62.93.1SOURCE: GLASSDOOR.With these numbers in mind, let's look at some comments from the respondents and see how they fit within the broader context of these ratings.One comment that particularly stuck out was from a current employee working in supply chain management. The employee offered the following advice to management, suggesting the potential long-term sacrifice that comes with IBM's $20 EPS target: ""Need to understand the impact of layoff[s]. A lot of knowledge leaves with the employee.""A current advisory software engineer cited a similar concern: ""Trying to do too much with too little. Understaffed. Often trying to catch up with technology.""Turning toward the more positive comments, 595 reviewers indicated they found the work environments ""flexible.""In fact, of the five most touched upon positive reviews highlights, three praised the company's work/life balance. This, unsurprisingly, correlates well with the numerical rating.Overall, the general ""flavor"" these reviews give is that IBM has a solid work/life balance but that the company's focus on growing profits through cost-cutting is proving frustrating for some employees.IBM's indirect consumer impactMuch of IBM's business isn't particularly aimed at individual consumers. While a company such as Facebook offers a social network for just about everybody, IBM provides what it calls ""social workforce solutions,"" which are essentially business-oriented social networking solutions.IBM's software is also very business-centric. For example, it builds ""mobile software"" (as the recent deal that IBM and Apple inked suggests). The focus of this software is, according to IBM, to leverage ""powerful analytics and usage data"" in order to allow its customers ""have more compelling interactions with their clients and workforce.""Additionally, IBM pointed out in its annual report that it has a ""rapidly growing roster of 30,000 client engagements,"" including partnerships with Honda and ""hundreds of top online games with a user base exceeding 100 million.""While IBM's products aren't all that consumer-facing, it looks as though these products have a positive impact on many large organizations, which, in turn, helps those organizations better service customers.How about the broader world?IBM, like many other large tech companies, appears to put a lot of effort into ""green"" practices. IBM claims that between 1990 and 2012, it ""saved 6.1 billion kWh of electricity consumption, avoided 3.9 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, and saved $477 million through its annual energy conservation actions.""The company also has a ""product stewardship"" program in place that is aimed at making its products more environmentally friendly. The company claims that it designs its products with ""consideration for their upgradeability to extend product life,"" and aims to make sure its products can be safely disposed of at the end of their lives.IBM also aims to improve the energy efficiency of its products, and will try to use recycled materials ""where they are technically and economically"" justifiable.Foolish takeawayMake no mistake: IBM is an incredibly powerful and financially sound company with plenty going for it. However, like any other company, it faces its share of challenges. Going forward, it'll be interesting to see whether the company can get the revenue growth engine started up again, and if IBM will address any of the internal issues mentioned by current employees.The $16,122 Social Security bonus you could be missingIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

Why IBM Is One of the Biggest Warren Buffett Stocks,"Nov 28, 2014 at 2:13PM","Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) CEO and mastermind Warren Buffett is one of the finest investing minds on the planet. His tried-and-true strategy involves betting big on simple businesses run by fantastic management teams. His favorite holding period is ""forever,"" but only if he understands the target company inside and out.So when Buffett built a massive position in technology giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) over the last three years, many investors and analysts were left scratching their heads. Buffett prefers investing in traditional industries like banking, retail, or consumer goods. So why would he suddenly want a 5.5% stake in a technology firm -- and a complex one spanning several sectors, at that?That question burns as hotly as ever. IBM's shares have tumbled in 2014 but Buffett's stake only grew larger. At the latest count, Berkshire owned 8.3% of Big Blue, making it the third-largest holding in Buffett's portfolio.IBM'S HEADQUARTERS IN ARMONK, N.Y. SOURCE: IBMDoesn't Buffett hate to lose money?Truth be told, Buffett must be delighted to see IBM's share prices withering. After all, it's exactly what he was hoping for three years ago.""We should wish for IBM's stock price to languish throughout the [next] five years,"" Buffett wrote in Berkshire's 2012 letter to shareholders. IBM is known to spend a lot of money on share buybacks, so it only makes sense to wish for lower share prices while that train is rolling.The combination of IBM's shrinking share count and Berkshire's modest further investments in the stock has resulted in the far higher ownership stake Buffett's company holds today.""The logic is simple,"" Buffett wrote in 2012. ""If you are going to be a net buyer of stocks in the future, either directly with your own money or indirectly (through your ownership of a company that is repurchasing shares), you are hurt when stocks rise. You benefit when stocks swoon. Emotions, however, too often complicate the matter: Most people, including those who will be net buyers in the future, take comfort in seeing stock prices advance. These shareholders resemble a commuter who rejoices after the price of gas increases, simply because his tank contains a day's supply.""What a delightfully Foolish perspective. Low share prices only hurt if you're selling. At all other times, investors are better served by low prices. That way, you can afford more shares for yourself, while share buybacks and reinvested dividends achieve their maximum impact. That's pure gold to long-term investors like Warren Buffett, who have no plans to sell anytime soon.What does Buffett know that I don't?Beyond Big Blue's financial strength and Buffett's respect for its past and current management teams, IBM actually fits right into his wheelhouse.As chairman of the Mid-Continent Tab Company in the 1950s, Buffett competed directly with IBM -- and lost a lot of business to Big Blue. He's been reading IBM's annual reports ever since, making him arguably one of the world's leading experts on how IBM does business.What Buffett's investment thesis in IBM boils down to is remarkably simple. The company's leaders like to set up ambitious long-term goals, published out in the open. With these clear targets in plain view to analysts, investors, and rival businesses alike, IBM then knocks the goals down like clockwork.That's how you impress Warren Buffett into buying over 70 million shares in your company.SOURCE: IBMShould I follow Buffett's example?Now, Warren Buffett is no ordinary shareholder. In order to move the needle for his enormous investment portfolio, he must work on a scale that leaves regular billionaires flat-footed, and ordinary investors can only dream about. That said, many of Buffett's reasons for owning IBM shares apply to regular retail investors as well.For example, IBM has reduced its share count by nearly 20% since the start of 2011, investing almost $50 billion in share buybacks. That's a boon to every class of investor, as share values rise when the share count falls.The jury may still be out on IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, who took the helm right after Buffett disclosed his large IBM investment. The market certainly doesn't seem convinced that her chosen strategy is the right one, judging by those plunging share prices.But then, change is always difficult, especially when the long-term benefits of a new strategy can only come after a few years of seemingly disastrous adjustments. That's the case for IBM right now. As the company distances itself from low-margin hardware systems sales, revenues are stalling. The end result should be stronger profit margins and a healthier business overall, but investors have come to expect a certain sales heft out of IBM -- and Rometty isn't making it a priority.So IBM's shares are falling on short-term concerns, as the company prepares for a more profitable long-term future. Buffett sure doesn't mind the resulting discount prices on IBM shares, and Berkshire's recent buys show that he still believes in the business model.If he's right, investors who buy IBM shares at today's low prices will benefit just as strongly as Buffett does.He just happens to have about $13.4 billion more skin in the game.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What Exactly Is IBM These Days?,"Jul 24, 2014 at 8:00PM","International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the most interesting propositions in the technology sector. The company is seeing ongoing deterioration in revenue. However, in common with its rival, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), it still generates large amounts of free cash flow, and it's making aggressive investments in its growth platforms. Moreover, Oracle and IBM are both making partnerships -- witness IBM's recent deal with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)-- in order to remain relevant in a changing IT landscape. With that said, investors are entitled to ask an existentialist question about IBM. What is it? A low-growth and highly cash-generative value play, or a company transitioning toward a becoming a long-term growth story?IBM raises more questions than answersFirst things first, IBM is not an expensive stock. The company trades on 13.3 times current earnings and less than 11 times the company's projection for non-GAAP EPS for 2014. For some value investors, that's pretty much all they need to know. Throw in the 2.4% dividend yield, and the targeted $16 billion in free cash flow for the year and it's seemingly a no-brainer.Unfortunately, investing isn't as easy as that, and there are plenty of questions being asked about the company's plans. A chart of its segmental revenue growth reveals the extent of the revenue decline in recent years. Global technology services hasn't recorded positive year-over-year growth since the first quarter of 2012, and Global business services has only generated two quarters of (paltry) growth since the end of 2011.SOURCE: IBM PRESENTATIONS.If its core business keeps declining, it won't be a value play anymore, and the pressure is intensifying for IBM to wring every bit of margin expansion it can out of falling revenue. Indeed, in its latest second-quarter results, IBM managed to generate a 10 basis point improvement in its non-GAAP gross margin, but because total revenue declined 2.2%, its non-GAAP gross profit fell by 2 percentage points.Why IBM isn't OracleIn some ways, it's easy to compare IBM with Oracle. Both are mature highly cash-generative companies with slowing or declining revenue growth, and both are investing in growth platforms. However, the difference is that much of what Oracle is doing involves adjusting to how its customers want software delivery. In other words, there is a structural shift from traditional on-premise, on-license software toward cloud-based subscription delivery. Indeed, Fools already know how Oracle's revenue growth is being affected by foregoing upfront software license sales for cloud-based subscription ones.Oracle's growth initiatives involve shifting to the cloud, and supporting this activity by investing in infrastructure as a service, or IaaS, in order to support sales of its software. This is something that a host of other leading tech names, including IBM, are already doing.However, IBM's other growth initiatives come with more questions attached. In its latest earnings report, the company outlined that its strategic growth initiatives grew revenue in double-digits, with cloud revenue up more than 50 percent year to date, while its cloud delivered as a service increased its annual run rate by 100% to $2.8 billion year to year -- a big number, but still not significant when compared to total revenue in 2013 of nearly $100 billion. Moreover, the company outlined a number of growth investments, but many of them carry execution risk as well as uncertain end-demand prospects.The first-quarter launch of Bluemix, a cloud platform-as-a-service, or PaaS, for enterprises$1.2 billion investment in its SoftLayer clous hubs, an IaaS initiative$1 billion investment in its Watson supercomputer, to support IBM's big data analytics capabilities$3 billion investment in chip technology over the next five years, in order to support cloud and big data initiativesA global strategic partnership with Apple Inc, in order to develop business applications on Apple's productsWhile all of these initiatives are exciting, there is no guarantee IBM will win out in the IaaS or PaaS market against competitors like Oracle. Similarly, big data analytics is an obvious growth area, but IBM still has work to do to convince customers to buy future Watson solutions. As for the Apple partnership, it's somewhat dependent on Apple generating good growth of iPad sales to enterprises. Adding IBM's business software to Apple's hardware should create a value-add to Apple's products, but predicting IT hardware product trends is fraught with difficulty. Moreover, the enterprise market is not a core target market for Apple.So, what is IBM?All told, it's better to think of IBM as a growth company disguised as a value company. Its management is doing the right things by making divestitures and focusing on growth initiatives, but investors should not just buy into the stock on a value basis. Competition is fierce with Oracle and others, and the partnership with Apple Inc may sound exciting, but it's unlikely to meaningfully contribute to revenue anytime soon. In short, don't buy IBM just because it looks like a good value on a numbers basis alone.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Share Buybacks Are Killing IBM,"Dec 5, 2014 at 8:00AM","2014 is shaping up to be another strong year for stocks. Thanks to the recent rally, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has tacked on 7% this year after a 27% jump in 2013. But it seems like someone forgot to tell IBM (NYSE:IBM) the bull market is still in full swing. Shares of the blue chip tech giant have dipped 14% this year making it the worst-performing stock on the Dow.So, what's going on with Big Blue? The troubled started, in large part, thanks to a sharp sell-off following a dismal third-quarter earnings report. IBM reported adjusted earnings of $3.68, well short of estimates which averaged $4.32. In its quarterly release, the tech giant noted, ""A marked slowdown in September in client buying behavior, and our results also point to the unprecedented pace of change in our industry."" That weak performance prompted management to jettison its long-held target of $20 in earnings per share in 2015.  The poor results were due, at least in part, to the fact that IBM is in the midst of a transition, selling off lower-margin legacy divisions in order to focus on higher-margin growth areas such as cloud computing, business analytics, mobile, and security, amid the the fast pace of change in the industry that's been made the scapegoat for the company's disappointing financial results. However, the stock's under-performance is nothing new. Over the last three years, the Dow has risen 47% while IBM has lost 15%. So what's killing Big Blue?After a strong 2011, IBM declared itself well on its way to exceeding its goal of $20 in earnings per share in its annual report that year. It also outlined four ""high-growth spaces that should drive approximately $20 billion in revenue growth by 2014."" Those areas were: Growth Markets, Business Analytics, Cloud, and Smarter Planet.Fast forward to 2014 and it's clear that these segments are hardly a growth engine for the company. In the third quarter, revenue from growth markets fell 5% after adjusting for currency translation. Performance in business analytics was better, but is only up 8% year-to-date. The quarterly report no longer makes reference to the ""Smarter Planet"" initiative, making that comparison impossible, which leaves cloud computing as the only component still delivering significant growth, having increased by 50% year-to-date, but cloud is increasingly a low-margin, highly competitive business.  Though IBM claimed that those growth areas would spark $20 billion revenue growth between 2011 and 2015, revenue has instead fallen by about $9 billion or 9%, in that time as the chart below shows.IBM REVENUE (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTSWhere's all the money going?The $20 EPS goal for 2015 wasn't just predicated on sales growth. IBM has been implementing a massive share buyback program that has reduced share count from 1.16 billion at the end of 2011 to 990 million today, accounting for over $30 billion in repurchases.The buyback program is nothing new for IBM. In the five years leading up to 2011, the company repurchased $50 billion worth of shares, which helped the stock nearly double in that period. The difference then was that IBM was still a growing company. As the chart below shows, revenue increased at a solid pace during those five years with the exception of a dip during the recession.IBM REVENUE (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTSDespite IBM's woes over the last three years, it has not increased spending on Research & Development to boost its growth endeavors, and it has actually spent more on dividends and share buybacks than it has brought in in free cash flow. Last year, expenditures on dividends and buybacks nearly equaled operating cash flow. At the same time, its debt burden has jumped $10 billion to help fund the rampant buybacks.But buybacks are a luxury, not a necessity, and for a company to be spending so much on them, especially a technology company, seems to signal an unwillingness to invest in itself and its opportunities, which are necessary for growth. Share buybacks can be useful if shares are undervalued and the underlying business is strong, but for a weak business it does nothing to improve competitiveness. It's the laziest way to spend profits.IBM is not without its defenders of course. Chief among them is Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway owns 7% of the company. Though Buffett has eschewed investments in tech companies throughout his career, he bought IBM, starting in 2011, in part because its management had a pattern of declaring long-term goals and then methodically delivering on those promises. The problem with that argument though is that IBM is not Coca-Cola. It's not the same company it was 10 or 20 years ago, and it can't be expected to deliver a repeat performance. Its CEO, Ginny Rometty, has been at the helm just three years, and the company competes in a rapidly changing industry, which has forced it to reinvent itself several times in its history, including now.And its habit of setting those long-term goals is actually what got the company into trouble in the first place. IBM indeed set a goal for 2015, at $20 EPS, but instead of growing its business to try to meet that goal, it instead took a short cut with buybacks. Now, it finds itself in a much weaker competitive position, and with declining revenue and profits. Perhaps Buffett should have followed his own earlier advice on tech stocks. Back in 1996, during the tech boom, he told Berkshire investors, ""We are searching for operations that we believe are virtually certain to possess enormous competitive strength ten or twenty years from now. A fast-changing industry environment may offer the chance for huge wins, but it precludes the certainty we seek.""These days, the only thing certain at IBM seems to be more buybacks. "
IBM vs. Hewlett-Packard: Which Company Has the Better Plan?,"Oct 28, 2014 at 9:17AM","Both IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) are a part of old tech, with histories spanning multiple generations. Hewlett-Packard was founded in the depths of the Great Depression, bringing a sound-testing device to market in 1938. IBM, formerly the Computing Tabulating Recording Co., traces its roots back 60 years earlier, before the turn of the 20th century.Moving forward, you'll find two companies facing difficulties in this new tech paradigm. IBM reported lower revenue last fiscal year than in 2008, the height of the Great Recession. Hewlett-Packard also reported higher revenue in 2008 than it did last year. The two CEOs have taken different approaches to shareholder returns going forward, and investors need to ask which CEO has the better plan: IBM's Ginny Rometty or HP's Meg Whitman.IBM's high-margin focus combined with an aggressive share repurchase programFirst of all, it's pretty safe to assume that IBM's revenue growth will be hampered going forward as well. The issue isn't one of operations, but rather one of choice. Recently, IBM has been on a divestiture spree. It sold its x86 server business to Lenovo earlier this year and it announced that it was selling its chip business to Globalfoundries when reporting disappointing earnings earlier this week.In turn, IBM seeks to return value to shareholders through a combination of its generous capital return policy and a focus on higher-margin businesses. In an interview today, Rometty acknowledged IBM's poor performance but said the company is reinventing itself by focusing on data analysis and cloud computing. ""The strategy is correct,"" she said. ""Now it's our speed of execution that needs to improve.""One area where speed isn't a concern is IBM's capital return policy. The following chart will give you the proper context about IBM's cash moves over the past five full fiscal years:SOURCE: IBM'S 10-KS. ALL FIGURES ARE IN MILLIONS. LEFT Y-AXIS DENOTES DOLLAR FIGURES, AND RIGHT Y-AXIS IS SHARES OUTSTANDING.The company has engaged in a rather aggressive capital return policy. Since 2009, it has given back over $80 billion to shareholders, with $64 billion coming from share repurchases. The end result is a company that has reduced its shares outstanding by nearly 18%. And after the drop, IBM is valued at a price-to-earnings ratio of 10 and a dividend yield of 2.4%Hewlett-Packard goes a different routeHewlett-Packard has also engaged in buying back its stock, although not at the same scale as IBM. However, going forward, the company is looking to split the company's consumer-facing business into a company called HP and a business-oriented company named Hewlett-Packard Enterprises. The company expects that a spinoff will let each business be more nimble and will allow for the divestiture to ""unlock value"" (read: command higher valuation multiples). Right now, the company trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of 13 and a dividend yield of 2%.And it is possible, but these two sections face different threats: Hewlett-Packard's consumer-facing business is facing struggles in both its PC and printer businesses. And while a good part of that is weak hardware markets overall as PCs are being disrupted by tablets, HP is strongly affected by this trend. In Enterprise, Hewlett-Packard finds a better growth story in terms of macroeconomics, but intense competition from IBM, Dell, EMC, Microsoft, and Amazon.com.Final thoughtsWhile both companies seek to adjust to the new tech world, I think IBM is the stronger play. First, I think the argument about unlocking value isn't a strong one for long-term investors. Although spinoffs tend to outperform for the first three years after the divestiture, long-term fundamental investors need to consider intentions. Does the split improve the company fundamentally, or is a CEO reaching to compensate for lack of growth and no clear path forward operationally?Sadly, I think the latter is the case with HP. While Whitman has spoken ad nauseum of HP's turnaround, it still hasn't materialized yet. So right now, IBM is a higher-yielding investment that's cheaper on a price-to-earnings ratio after its post-earnings drop, with a plan to enrich shareholders.IBM's plan appears to be buying back shares and growing its margins, rather than revenue, to add value for shareholders. And while the company disappointed some shareholders by reneging on its wildly ambitious $20 EPS target by 2015, the company still lowered its shares outstanding by 18% in five years. In short, I like IBM's shot in the high-margin cloud space and enterprise moves with Apple more than I like Hewlett-Packard's enterprise and consumer chances.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here's Why IBM Still Has a Deep Economic Moat,"Jun 3, 2014 at 12:15PM","International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has had a rough couple of years. The company's hardware business has been on the decline, and this has driven revenue to fall in both 2012 and 2013. IBM was slow to adapt to the cloud. Its loss of a CIA contract to build a private cloud to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) last year was an embarrassing failure for the storied company. But even with these recent struggles, IBM still has a very deep economic moat, and the cloud isn't going to change that.The power of the mainframe computerSOURCE: IBMIn 2012, only about 4% of IBM's revenue came from selling mainframe computers, the hulking systems that look more like a refrigerator than a modern piece of technology. However, including all of the hardware, software, and services related to the mainframe, these systems were responsible for 25% of IBM's revenue and nearly half of IBM's profits.During IBM's most recent quarter, revenue from System Z mainframe systems declined by 40% year over year. While this may seem ominous, this decline is actually right in line with what the mainframe business has done historically. Each time a new mainframe system is released, sales rapidly rise as organizations upgrade their systems. This rise is then followed by a steep decline, and the cycle begins anew.Why are companies still buying mainframes when the cloud seems to be the solution to everything these days? Well, IBM's mainframes can process an enormous number of transactions in an extremely reliable and secure way. The mean time between failure, or MTBF, is more than 20 years, and redundancies are built in to avoid any single point of failure. The architecture is such that there is no threat of viruses and little chance of hacking, something that cannot be said for servers or cloud systems.Avoiding downtimeThis level of reliability and security makes mainframes ideal for running mission-critical business processes where any downtime would be catastrophic. In 2012, 96 of the world's top 100 banks used IBM's System Z mainframes to process transactions, and the rise of mobile transactions only makes the argument for mainframes stronger.Mainframes are not for everyone, though, and the market for cloud services is almost certainly going to grow far faster than the market for mainframes. But organizations that rely on the mainframe for mission-critical processes are extremely unlikely to move to the cloud.Public clouds like Amazon's, while generally reliable, have had some major failures over the past few years. In October 2012, a memory leak related to a replaced server snowballed into a widespread outage, interrupting services like Reddit, Foursquare, and GitHub. In August 2013, a hardware failure related to a single networking device led to data loss and issues with services like Instagram, Vine, and AirBnB.Moving to a private cloudA private cloud would solve the issue of security, as organizations with sensitive information should be reluctant to trust that data to a public cloud, but it would still be subject to the same types of problems. Cloud systems have redundancies built in so they can avoid issues like this, but with so many things that could go wrong, something inevitability will. The CIA contract that IBM lost to Amazon was for a private cloud very likely based on the x86 architecture, much like Amazon's public cloud, and not mainframes, and in that area IBM doesn't have much of an advantage. IBM has since sold its x86 server operations to Lenovo.One company that absolutely needs the level of reliability that only mainframes can offer is Visa. Visa operates one of the largest electronic payment networks in the world, with trillions of dollars in payment volume going through its systems each year. Over the past 20 years, Visa's system has had 100% availability, with the company pointing out that even during the busy holiday season, there has never been any downtime whatsoever. IBM mainframes make this possible, and Visa offers a great example of why IBM's mainframes are here to stay.The bottom lineWhile IBM adapts to a changing technological landscape, sells off some businesses and invests in new ones, the mainframe computer remains at the heart of the company. The mainframe is the source of IBM's most important and durable competitive advantage, and it will be the source of a significant portion of the company's profits for years to come."
IBM Earnings Preview: Does Revenue Growth Really Matter?,"Jul 16, 2014 at 11:00AM","Shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) have been essentially flat over the past year, fluctuating around the same level due to concerns that the company's hardware business is falling apart. During the first quarter, revenue from IBM's Systems and Technology group declined by 23% year-over-year, and the segment recorded a $660 million pre-tax loss. The market hasn't been kind to IBM in light of these results, and the company's stock has been greatly underperforming other sellers of enterprise hardware, such as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ).IBM DATA BY YCHARTSAs IBM prepares to report its second quarter earnings after market close on July 17, analysts are expecting continued revenue declines. The most important question that investors need to ask themselves is: does it really matter?A decade of stagnationRevenue stagnation is nothing new for IBM. Over the past decade, IBM's revenue has been essentially flat, so the company's recent troubles really aren't out of the ordinary.While revenue hasn't been growing, earnings per share has tripled over the past decade. A combination of rising margins and aggressive share buybacks have pushed the company's EPS from about $5 in 2004 to $15 in 2013, all while revenue has only grown by 3.5% during that time.Why hasn't revenue been growing? Because IBM has a history of selling off businesses where it is unable to gain or maintain a competitive advantage. The company sold its PC business back in 2004, and it's currently attempting to gain approval for the sale of its x86 server business. In addition, Bloomberg recently reported that IBM is close to a deal to sell its chip foundry business, estimated to be losing as much as $1.5 billion per year, to Globalfoundries.IBM has no advantages in either the x86 server business, where most servers are powered by Intel chips, or the chip foundry business, which has become ultra-competitive in recent years. Given the choice between growing revenue and ditching lackluster businesses, IBM typically chooses the latter. The sale of businesses like these, and the focus on areas where the company has a competitive advantage, is why IBM's revenue growth and earnings growth have deviated by so much in the past.The recent results from competitors in the server business bear out IBM's decision to sell. Hewlett-Packard relied on enterprise hardware for about 40% of its operating profit in its most recent quarter, and servers make up a large part of that segment. During the past two years, HP's enterprise hardware operating margin has been in continual decline, falling from around 18% to just 14.4% in the most recent quarter. Much like PCs, x86 servers are increasingly becoming a commodity, and IBM has done a far better job than HP in the past of relying too heavily on commodity products for its profits.Looking forwardThere are a few major catalysts for IBM going forward that investors should keep an eye on. First, once IBM closes the sale of both its x86 server operation and its chip foundry operation, the bottom line should see a significant boost. Both businesses are losing money, and shedding those assets will help undo some of the margin compression that IBM has suffered in the recent past.Second, the mainframe business will eventually recover. During the first quarter, revenue from System Z, which is IBM's mainframe computer system, declined by a whopping 40% year-over-year. This may sound terrible, but the mainframe business is cyclical, rising when IBM refreshes the hardware, and declining in between. There's no reason to believe that the current decline is any different, as many industries, like banking, remain locked into the mainframe ecosystem.Third, investments in new R&D projects should continue to drive innovation at the company. IBM's Watson, the Jeopardy-winning computer system that IBM developed to process natural language and make hypotheses, is being turned into its own business unit with a $1 billion investment, and IBM hopes to derive $10 billion in revenue from the system within the next decade. Watson has plenty of possible applications, ranging from aiding doctors in making diagnoses to creating the perfect barbecue sauce.A BARBECUE SAUCE RECIPE CREATED BY IBM'S WATSON. SOURCE: IBMIBM is also investing $3 billion over the next five years in advanced chip design, with plans to push transistor sizes down to 7nm, possibly using exotic materials like carbon nanotubes as an alternative to silicon. This is a big investment, representing about 10% of the company's annual R&D spending, and there are very few companies on earth with the expertise necessary to attempt such a project. If IBM succeeds, it could lead to enormous gains in processor performance and efficiency. This is a long-term project, so don't expect progress anytime soon, but IBM is positioning itself to lead the way as the amount of data that companies are dealing with continues to explode.The bottom lineWhile IBM will likely report another revenue decline, it seems that a mountain is being made of a molehill. IBM's revenue hasn't really grown for a decade as the company has shed underperforming businesses, and its focus on areas where it can gain a competitive advantage has led to exceptional margins. Going forward, IBM is making investments in the future while it exits commodity businesses, and the result should be long-term earnings growth for the company.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why IBM Should Increase Capital Expenditures,"Oct 16, 2014 at 3:12PM","Technology giant International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has made great strides in its huge business transition. During the past few years, IBM has spent a lot more money on software and services, particularly when it comes to the cloud. At the same time, the company has pulled back on its exposure to hardware. This is a painful transition, but a necessary one, because IBM revenue has been stagnant for several quarters in a row.Specifically, IBM's total revenue is down 3% during the first six months of 2014, year over year. The key culprit is hardware; but this stands to change. IBM is investing a lot of money in new strategic initiatives, and real progress is starting to materialize.However, how much progress IBM makes in these initiatives may be limited, because the company spends a lot more money on returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks than it spends on capital expenditures. Through the first half of 2014, dividends and share buybacks made up 89% of IBM's capital allocation program, with the remainder being sourced to capital expenditures. IBM ventures into the cloudIBM is investing in cloud-based services, with the goal of branching out away from hardware. This makes sense, because hardware has been weighing on IBM for some time. Hardware has been the company's worst-performing segment since the start of the year. Revenue from IBM's systems and technology business declined 16% through the first six months, year over year.By contrast, IBM has experienced very good results in its businesses outside of hardware. Cloud revenue soared more than 50% during the first half of the year. Cloud-as-a-service revenue more than doubled to a $2.8 billion annual run rate.These results are the product of greater investment in new, high-growth areas. In the first quarter of 2014, IBM launched Bluemix, its cloud platform-as-a-service for the enterprise. IBM invested $1.2 billion to expand its SoftLayer cloud hubs. IBM also invested $1 billion at that time to bring Watson to the enterprise.IBM made progress implementing these initiatives last quarter. Bluemix became available in June, new SoftLayer data centers were opened, and IBM divested its customer care business. Going forward, IBM will invest $3 billion during the next five years in research and development in next-generation chips, which will be critical for cloud and big data systems.There's room for greater capital spendingFor many years, IBM has undergone a transition away from hardware and into other areas, such as software and services. This was done to improve profitability. Hardware is a much lower-margin business than software and services. The results have been clear to see.From 2000-2013, IBM's operating pre-tax margin more than doubled, from 10% to 21%. Not surprisingly, this has required a great deal of internal investment -- IBM's capital expenditures have totaled $59 billion just since 2000.As huge a number as that is, the money IBM has spent on capital expenditures has actually paled in comparison to how much the company spends on returning cash to shareholders. Since 2000, IBM has spent $108 billion on share repurchases and an additional $30 billion on dividends. If anything, IBM has underallocated its capital spending.IBM stated in its most recent conference call with analysts that the overarching strategy for the expansion of its cloud platforms and offerings in big data is to get a strong foothold in the emerging businesses of IT. IBM believes that these investments will set up the company for better growth during the long term.If this is indeed true, then it makes sense for IBM to maximize its investment in these areas. As it stands, IBM has spent $13.9 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the first half of the year, and just $1.7 billion on capital expenditures in the same period. But even if IBM didn't want to cut back on dividends or share repurchases, it has $9.7 billion in cash sitting on the balance sheet it could draw from. This makes sense, because that cash is earning almost nothing, and simply sitting on the books for IBM right now.In light of this, it's reasonable to question whether IBM is investing enough in development.

"3 Charts That May Scare You Away From IBM, and 1 Big Reason to Buy Big Blue Today","Jun 16, 2014 at 2:00PM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) has not been kind to investors since Ginni Rometty took over Sam Palmisano's CEO office. The stock hasn't necessarily lost shareholders a ton of money over the last two years and change, but IBM has lagged far behind the surging Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI).IBM TOTAL RETURN PRICE DATA BY YCHARTS.When Rometty took the helm, IBM had a smoothly humming cash machine. She did not leave Palmisano's creation untouched, however.IBM remains in the midst of a multiyear strategy shift, which is placing a heavy emphasis on cloud-computing software and services while moving away from the old hardware powerhouse. IBM is selling an important piece of its server hardware empire to Chinese rival Lenovo, leaving a far smaller server business with a focus on power systems and mainframes.SOURCE: IBM.Strategy shifts are never easy, and this is no exception.Let me show you a few charts that might scare hardened investors away from buying IBM shares today.First, the missing hardware revenue is making a difference, both in direct sales and in cash generation:IBM REVENUE (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.Second, IBM stock gets a ton of direct attention from the company's board of directors, which has spent $92 billion on share buybacks over the last 10 years. This strategy has kept price-to-earnings ratios low and sinking, but cash-based valuation metrics don't look so rosy:IBM PRICE TO FREE CASH FLOW (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.Finally, not even the analyst crowd is convinced that IBM is headed in the right direction. The PEG ratio is a measure of valuation with a big side of Wall Street analysis, since it incorporates analysts' estimates of forward growth.Here, anything below a 1 value might point to an undervalued stock, while 2 and above are often seen as red flags -- warning signs of disappointing growth.IBM's recent PEG scores are downright terrifying, whether you compare those growth estimates to reported results or give IBM the benefit of next-year earnings estimates:IBM PEG RATIO (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.Have a seat. Grab a cool drink. Wipe the sweat off your brow. We're done with the scary charts now.The next one will be much more soothing. Here's what Ginni Rometty's remixed product strategy is doing to IBM's profit margins:IBM GROSS PROFIT MARGIN (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.So how will we determine whether Rometty is a big winner or an abject failure?The trick is to restore that flagging revenue growth without sacrificing IBM's fantastic margins. Rometty must complete this transition without jangling the nerves of customers and shareholders too much. That's why she's moving slowly, taking one small step at a time rather than trying to complete the whole shift in a single year.There are always unexpected roadblocks on the way. For example, IBM misjudged the impact of new Chinese government attitudes to foreign products last year, and it couldn't have predicted the chilling effect on international trade of Edward Snowden's disclosures on U.S. National Security Agency activities. These events have added some weight to IBM's burden in 2013 and 2014.But Big Blue has the resources to overcome these short-term challenges, and I believe that Rometty's new strategy is a good choice for the long run. This stock might still fall further as IBM's business blueprint gets redrawn, but market timing is the bad kind of fool's errand. I would be shocked if these shares aren't back to beating the Dow five years from now."
3 Stocks With an Enviable History of Increasing Dividends,"Oct 24, 2014 at 11:34AM","The tech sector is not one that's typically known for being a great source of dividends. Many technology companies eschew dividends entirely, or pay token dividends, instead favoring share buybacks as the preferred way to return profits to shareholders. But there are a few tech companies that not only pay dividends that are competitive with nontech dividend stalwarts, but have also increased those dividends consistently over the past decade or longer. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), AT&T (NYSE:T), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) are three examples, and their respective dividend records should be the envy of the tech sector.Nearly a century of dividendsWhile IBM is currently going through quite a rough patch, reporting a terrible third quarter that seemed to take everyone by surprise, the company's dividend record remains unblemished. IBM has paid consecutive quarterly dividends every year since 1916, soon after the company's founding, it has raised its dividend each year for the past 19 years, and that increase has been greater than 10% for 11 years in a row. The most recent dividend increase, announced in April of this year, boosted the dividend by 16%.IBM DIVIDEND DATA BY YCHARTSIBM stock currently yields about 2.7%, well above the current 2% dividend yield of the S&P 500. Looking forward, IBM currently pays out just a small fraction of its earnings in the form of dividends. In fiscal 2013, a little less than a quarter of the company's $16.5 billion in net income was paid out to investors, so there's plenty of room to increase the dividend further, even if the recent issues plaguing the company continue.IBM does spend far more money on share buybacks than it does on dividends, but the positive for dividend investors is that the reduction in the share count allows the per-share dividends to increase faster than earnings growth without increasing the payout ratio. Even if IBM fails to meaningfully grow earnings over the next few years, the dividend can still rise in the double-digits without putting pressure on the company's cash flow.A Dividend AristocratAT&T, the telecom giant that provides wireline and wireless services to millions of customers in the United States, is part of a select group of companies known as Dividend Aristocrats. These companies have raised their respective dividends for at least 25 years in a row, and AT&T is one of the only companies on the list that can be considered a tech company. With the latest increase announced in December of last year, AT&T has raised its dividend for 30 years in a row.T DIVIDEND DATA BY YCHARTSAT&T already pays out a significant fraction of its earnings in the form of dividends, and its business is extremely capital intensive. In 2013, AT&T spent a staggering $20.9 billion on capital expenditures, and of the remaining free cash flow, dividends ate up about 70%. Thanks to share buybacks in the past few years, AT&T has managed to increase its per-share dividend while keeping the total amount of cash it pays out to investors essentially flat.Low-single digit dividend growth is the best investors should expect from AT&T going forward, but with a 5.4% dividend yield and a business with an extremely high barrier to entry, AT&T is an attractive stock for dividend investors.A growth stock and a dividend stockQualcomm's meteoric rise over the past decade, brought on by the explosion of the smartphone market, has brought with it an equally meteoric rise in the company's dividend. From fiscal 2004 to 2013, Qualcomm's revenue increased by a factor of five, earnings per share nearly quadrupled, and its annual dividend payments increased by more than a factor of six. Qualcomm has only been paying a dividend since 2003, but with an increase every year since then, the company has become a reliable dividend growth machine.QCOM DIVIDEND DATA BY YCHARTSQualcomm's dividend yield is on the low side, just 2.3%, although it's still higher than that of the S&P 500. Qualcomm paid out a little more than 30% of its earnings as dividends in fiscal 2013, although this percentage is now higher thanks to a 20% dividend increase announced earlier this year. Given Qualcomm's continued earnings growth, which analysts expects to top 11% annually over the next five years, along with heavy share buyback activity, which will push the share count lower, double-digit dividend increases are very much in the cards for Qualcomm going forward.Final thoughtsThere aren't too many tech stocks that can rightfully be called dividend stocks as well, but IBM, AT&T, and Qualcomm fit the bill. All three have long records of increasing dividends, and all three should be able to continue rewarding shareholders with further increases going forward."
Tech News: IBM and NVIDIA Will Power the World's Fastest Supercomputer,"Nov 22, 2014 at 3:04PM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) announced earlier this month that it had secured two contracts from the U.S. Department of Energy, worth a total of $325 million, to build two new supercomputers at the Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories. Both supercomputers will be more powerful than the fastest system in operation today, and this deal marks the first big win for IBM's OpenPOWER initiative.SOURCE: OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY.NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), also a member of OpenPOWER, will supply its Tesla GPUs to accelerate both new supercomputers, along with NVLink, a technology that greatly increases the rate at which data can be transferred from CPU to GPU. The supercomputer being replaced by the faster of the two new systems, Titan, was NVIDIA's first big win in the supercomputer space, and it helped begin the era of conducting scientific calculations on the GPU.Dealing with Big DataBoth supercomputers will handle Big Data problems, which involve crunching enormous amounts of data, and IBM has optimized the architecture underlying the systems specifically for this task. Simply increasing the performance of the CPUs and GPUs isn't enough, because much of the work being done when Big Data is involved is simply moving data back and forth between storage and the processors. As IBM stated in its press release, ""The popular practice of putting design emphasis solely on faster microprocessors becomes progressively more untenable because the computing infrastructure is dominated by data movement and data management.""This is a dig at Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), a company with a near-monopoly in the server CPU market, and the main target of IBM's OpenPOWER initiative. IBM's power systems have been losing market share for years to x86-based systems, mostly powered by Intel chips, and IBM's decision to open up the architecture is seemingly starting to pay off.One reason IBM won these contracts is energy efficiency. Supercomputers consume monstrous amounts of power, with the fastest supercomputer in the world, the Tianhe-2 in China, using about 17.8 megawatts. To put this in perspective, that's enough to power a little more than 14,000 average homes in the United States.Titan, the system Oak Ridge is replacing, uses 8.2 MW of power. Summit, the larger of the two new supercomputers, will use about 10 MW of power, but it will provide five to 10 times the performance of Titan. This increased energy efficiency is due to efficiency gains in NVIDIA's GPUs and the minimization of moving data around the system.What it means for IBMIBM's Power architecture gets a big win with these systems. While Intel is unlikely to give up its massive market share in the server CPU market, the subset of that market that deals with Big Data could be up for grabs. IDC predicts the Big Data technology and services market is going to grow at a 27% compound annual rate through 2017, turning into a $32 billion market by that time, and IBM has a real chance at claiming a significant portion.The OpenPOWER initiative makes this more likely, as it allows other hardware and software companies to develop products that are tightly integrated with the Power architecture. There's a big incentive for many companies to create a viable alternative to Intel-based systems; Google, for example, sends plenty of money Intel's way each year in building out its cloud data centers. With Intel having a near-monopoly, the company can charge extremely high prices.The supercomputer deal is an important accomplishment for IBM, and it provides a high-profile example of the benefits of OpenPOWER.What it means for NVIDIANVIDIA has become the leader in the high-performance computing accelerator card market, and while the enterprise division is still a small part of its overall business, it has been growing fast. From fiscal 2010 to 2014, NVIDIA's high-performance computing and data center revenue has grown at a 64% compound annual rate.NVIDIA's GPUs are in 17 of the top 100 supercomputers in the world, and that number will likely grow as GPUs become more common in supercomputing. NVIDIA's biggest competitor is Intel, which has its own line of accelerator cards, the Xeon Phi, but so far NVIDIA has maintained its lead, with the Phi present in only 11 of the top 100 supercomputers.Intel certainly isn't standing still, with the company set to launch an updated Phi in the second half of 2015. But one of NVIDIA's strengths is the vast catalog of software that has been adapted to run on its GPUs, such as scientific simulations, business analytics, and 3-D modeling programs. This creates lock-in and switching costs, and it makes it more difficult for Intel to gain traction in the market.A single company is unlikely to battle Intel in the enterprise market, but with the companies involved in the OpenPOWER initiative working together, Intel has much to worry about. The supercomputer deal is the first piece of evidence that Intel has a real competitor on its hands for the first time in years, at least when it comes to Big Data.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

4 Secrets Warren Buffett's Favorite Dividend Stocks Can Teach You,"Nov 2, 2014 at 1:35PM","Recently I wrote about six little-known dividend growth stocks that could hold the key to your ability to retire in comfort and security.This was based on two studies, one from 2008 by Jack Gardner, who found that the highest 100 yielding companies in the S&P 500 outperformed the entire index by 28.4% annually between 1968 and 2007. A 2004 study by Ned Davis likewise found that, between 1972 and 2004, dividend growth stocks were the best-performing class of stock.Dividend Policy Annual Return 1972-2004S&P 500 8.5%Nondividend payers 4.3%Dividend cutters and eliminators 5.2%Dividend growers 7.2%All dividend payers 10.1%Dividend growers and initiators 10.6%SOURCE: ""DIVIDENDS, METALS, AND 1960 REPLAYS,"" NED DAVIS RESEARCH.During my research I came across four investing principles that studies show lead to superior long-term investing returns, and which none other than Warren Buffett, whom many consider history's greatest investor, continues to use to this day.

Given those facts, along with the research I cited above, its not surprising that these dividend growth stocks have outperformed the market by 32.9% annually over the last 21 years. The power of high-yielding, dividend-growth investing is well known to many investors. However, two investing principles personified in Buffett's dividend growth portfolio are less famous, yet equally important to achieving long-term investing success. Lower risk, higher rewardCompany Beta 5-year Projected Earnings Growth Rate 5-year Projected Dividend Growth Rate Age of Company (years)Wells Fargo 0.79 9.69% 8.50% 162Coca-Cola 0.51 4.60% 7.48% 128American Express 1.25 9.60% 8.94% 164IBM 0.86 8.27% 9% 114Wal-Mart 0.37 6.77% 5.95% 69Procter & Gamble 0.53 8.60% 5.16% 177ExxonMobil 1 3.18% 7.47% 144US Bancorp 0.72 6.90% 8.22% 85Moody's 1.590 13.80% 12.61% 114Average Top 10 Holdings 0.85 7.93% 8.15% 128.6S&P 500 1.00 12.54% 5.05% 15SOURCES: YAHOO FINANCE, FAST GRAPHS, YAHOO FINANCE, PROFESSOR RICHARD FOSTER, YALE UNIVERSITY.As seen in the above table, Buffett's top 10 dividend growth stocks have an average beta (a measure of volatility) that is 15% lower than the market. It turns out that lower volatility is key to the outperformance of this portfolio.In a 2011 study, Harvard University finance professor Malcolm Baker analyzed 40 years of stock market data and discovered something astonishing: ""Low-volatility and low-beta portfolios offered an enviable combination of high average returns and small drawdowns. This outcome runs counter to the fundamental principle that risk is compensated with higher expected return.""A 2010 New York University study found that low-volatility portfolios outperformed in ""18 of 19 global equity markets, in treasury markets, for corporate bonds sorted by maturity and rating, and in futures markets.""How is it possible that low-volatility investing can be so powerful? Well as explained by my Motley Fool colleague Matthew Frankel, the key is the smaller losses suffered during a bear market.For example, let's say you invested $1,000 into an S&P 500 index fund (beta 1) and $1,000 into a low-volatility portfolio (beta .5). If the market declines by 30%, the low -volatility portfolio drops by 15%. The next year the market rallies 40% while the low volatility portfolio climbs 20%. At the end, the S&P 500 index fund is worth $980, a 2% loss, but the low-volatility portfolio is is worth $1,020, up 2%.Is age an asset?The last investing principle I want to highlight is the fact that older companies often make exceptional, if ""dull,"" investments. Specifically, note that the average company in Buffett's top 10 dividend stocks is 128.6 years old, 8.6 times older than the average company in the S&P 500 and 53% older than Mr. Buffett's own age of 84.Why is age such an asset? Well, age by itself isn't, but what it represents can be. For example, the reason that the average age of company in the S&P 500 is only 15 years is mostly because of business failures, mergers, and acquisitions. As Richard Foster, emeritus director at McKinsey and a Yale management lecturer, explained:When a company has run its course it gets bought ... this is a good thing, because if the economy stops changing then productivity would go away ... all companies would like to think that they're going to be the Methuselah, but they're not.However, Buffett's favorite dividend stocks aren't ""all companies"": They represent some of the most successful brands and corporations in U,S, history -- the ones with exceptional management, long-term innovative spirit, and the ability to grow, adapt, prosper, and pay growing dividends through the most turbulent periods of history. These companies' longevity and superior dividend growth histories is proof of their enduring competitive advantages and what Buffett calls ""a wide moat.""For example, Procter & Gamble was founded in 1837 and has survived 10 financial panics, two depressions, both World Wars, two oil shocks, and the Great Recession of 2008-2009. Not only has the company grown and adapted through all that, but P&G has increased its dividend annually for the last 58 years, and made countless investors wealthy along the way. The key to long-term wealth creationIn Warren Buffett's 10 largest dividend holdings we see four important investing principles that history has proven are the key to long-term wealth creation: a higher than average yield, consistent dividend growth, low volatility, and an enduring competitive advantage and adaptability that allows a company to prosper (and enrich shareholders) for decades or centuries. Perhaps you've never thought about these principles or considered adapting them to your own investments. However, history and numerous studies indicate that you'd be better off in the long run if you at least considered adding a low volatility, high-yield dividend growth component to your portfolio.

Is IBM the Best Dow Jones Stock For Turnaround Investors?,"Jun 10, 2014 at 2:00PM","It's no secret that IBM (NYSE:IBM) has left investors hurting recently. Since the company missed estimates and painted a bleak guidance picture in spring 2013, its shares have lagged far behind their Dow Jones (DJINDICES:^DJI) peers.IBM TOTAL RETURN PRICE DATA BY YCHARTS.Is it time to give up on Big Blue? Or does CEO Ginni Rometty have a solid turnaround in store for patient investors?Let's start with IBM's official strategy road map.Big Blue publishes long-term strategy directions, and measures its performance against these stated goals. Crazy, I know, but this open hand hasn't stopped IBM from winning in the long term.SOURCE: IBM.Above all else, IBM takes pride in its ability to ""remix"" its businesses. The growth you see in the chart above did not come from holding on to established markets for dear life, but from dropping underperformers to refocus on new growth opportunities.Ten years ago, IBM's profit driver was an even blend of hardware, software, and services. Today, the low-margin hardware division is falling by the wayside as IBM pursues software and services with a single-minded passion.SOURCE: IBM.In particular, IBM is building a portfolio of enterprise-class services on cloud-based platforms.By the end of 2013, Big Blue had already spent $7 billion on research and investments in the cloud-computing market. The company holds more than 1,500 patents in this area, including research brought aboard in 15 cloud-focused acquisitions.Forget the tried-and-true but also outdated one-stop shop idea. This is what IBM is doing now. Big Blue doesn't want to be the entire information technology sky anymore. It's all about the clouds.It's a strong strategy with all kinds of long-term growth promise. But strategy changes can hurt, and this is no exception.IBM remains committed to a five-year plan that always pointed to $20 of operating earnings per share in 2015. Last year, the company delivered operating EPS of $16.28, leaving a rather large gap to cover in the last two years. IBM is guiding to $17.80 in 2014 earnings, which would be a 9% annual jump. The remaining distance to cover in 2015, then, is a tough 12% earnings increase.I'm confident that IBM will meet the $20 long-term target, but perhaps not in the most sustainable way.Some analysts complain about IBM's ""low-quality"" earnings, and it's easy to see why. Between 2000 and 2013, the company collected $165 billion in free cash flow. It spent $32 billion on acquisitions, $30 billion on cutting dividend checks, and $59 billion for capital expenses. But IBM also funneled a staggering $108 billion into share buybacks.Measuring these 14 years of ultragenerous buybacks against IBM's $186 billion market cap, you'll find the company has reduced its share count by 44%. Sometimes Big Blue had to borrow money to keep retiring shares -- and did it happily. The ever-shrinking share count has most certainly helped IBM meet its earnings goals. Not necessarily by making more money, but by moving the goal posts.IBM SHARES OUTSTANDING DATA BY YCHARTS.In the end, IBM investors must weigh Big Blue's flexibility against the potential for bottom-line trickery.I'm convinced that IBM has chosen the right path toward long-term profits. My my, hey hey, cloud computing is here to stay, as Neil Young might put it.But the big payoff might come a little too late to meet IBM's stated 2015 goal. That's why I wouldn't be surprised to see another massive buyback push, possibly powered by the current economy's large supply of low-interest debt.If that scares you, feel free to stay away from IBM. Personally, I prefer to take the long view. Come back in five years, and I believe that Rometty's strategy will have played out as planned. This is a hardscrabble turnaround in the making.I don't have a real-money position in IBM (yet!), but my CAPS portfolio will most certainly ride this turnaround for the next several years."
"Who’s Really in Charge of Microsoft Corporation? Nadella, Gates, or Ballmer?","Oct 16, 2014 at 2:17PM","For decades, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was synonymous with Bill Gates. After his childhood friend and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen retired in 1983 after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, Gates was Microsoft, and vice versa. As former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer learned after being named chief executive in 2000, following in the footsteps of a world technology leader isn't an easy proposition. Some would argue Ballmer brought on much of the ill-will from investors and industry pundits alike by holding on to the past much too long, rather than looking to the future.Based on Microsoft's recent successes in cloud-related solutions and its new emphasis on becoming a significant player in mobile technologies, Ballmer's replacement, Satya Nadella, has been a breath of fresh air. And shareholders have reaped the benefits, enjoying Microsoft's 24% jump in share price so far this year. Turns out, however, there's a bit more to the Nadella-Microsoft turnaround story, and it involves a familiar face.Heee's, back!An article was published in Vanity Fair recently discussing Microsoft's transition to Nadella, only the third CEO in company history, dating back to its inception nearly 40 years ago. Both Gates and Nadella were included in the discussion, and it became apparent the two are very much on the same page in terms how to ensure Microsoft remains, ""relevant.""Nadella said a key objective for Microsoft is to ensure software and services help people accomplish more, in less time. As he put it, the winner's in the tech industry will be those that do, ""the best job of building the right software experiences to give both organizations and individuals time back so that they can get more out of their time, that's the core of this company—that's the soul.""Gates was quick to piggy-back Nadella's comments, adding ""We're not even a third of the way toward empowering workers even to the dream that goes back to the start of the company."" Clearly, the two like-minded tech gurus share a common vision for the future of technology, and Microsoft's place in it. Which is a good thing, since it appears Gates himself is spending a great deal more time helping to define Microsoft's future than most of thought.As intriguing as the insights the two provided were, what may catch some by surprise was Gates' admission that he now devotes, ""30 percent"" of his time to Microsoft, a decision he made when Nadella was given the top job in early Feb. It's not shocking that Gates was working with Microsoft; his input is invaluable, but 30%? When a tech giant with the status of Gates come back into the fold, how long will it be before questions arise about who's really running the show at Microsoft?There's also the question of where Ballmer fits in the Microsoft picture, if at all? It's a valid question because as Microsoft fans may know, by spring of this year , Ballmer became the largest single owner of Microsoft stock, with approximately 4% of its outstanding shares. Of course Ballmer has already resigned from Microsoft's board, and has plenty on his plate already, including becoming the new owner of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers.Challenges remainDeveloping solutions to free up time, as Nadella suggested, or technologies that are ""pervasive,"" virtually surrounding us, as Gates alluded to, aren't novel ideas: one look at the growth in the Internet of Things makes that clear. And that puts Microsoft in the mix with a cast of familiar foes, including Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), among others. IBM's super computer Watson, and its emphasis on cloud big data solutions, dominate CEO Ginni Rometty's focus as she attempts to right the IBM ship. It's been slow going, but IBM is beginning to make some headway.If there was any doubt that Google saw the future of the industry as ""pervasive,"" ala Gates, its recent $3.2 billion acquisition of ""smart"" home solution provider Nest Labs answered that. You can add its line-up of wearables, an industry leading mobile OS, and a full suite of cloud solutions to Google's pervasive arsenal. Microsoft certainly has some challenges ahead, with or without Gates.Final Foolish thoughtsSo, who's running things up in Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, WA? Gates would be the first to say Nadella's CEO, and the buck stops with him. As for Ballmer, he may own the most stock, but he has no intention of muddying the Microsoft waters, he's got an NBA title to focus on. Which leaves Microsoft in the enviable position of having the best of both worlds: A new leader that has quickly changed Microsoft's culture, for the better, along with access to one of the technology industry's all-time leading innovators.

IBM Finally Joins Cloud Pricing Wars: What it Really Means for Big Blue,"Jul 13, 2014 at 10:00AM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) is among the last tech companies to join the cloud pricing wars that have been raging on this year. On June 10, IBM lowered the price of storage available through its SoftLayer cloud infrastructure service by 60% to just $0.04 per GB per month, bringing it within spitting distance of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS' $0.03 per GB per month, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Drive's $0.026 per GB per month. IBM also promised to lower virtual server prices by up to 5%.The funny thing is that IBM did not make a big splash about its price cuts, which was in stark contrast to its rivals, which unabashedly follow up on each other's cloud moves by announcing their own, often bigger, moves in a matter of days. So why did it take IBM so long to join the pricing wars, and why is it important?Dominance of IaaS and hybrid cloudAlthough IBM has plenty of enterprise credibility, the company has not had a strong developer or cloud history, until it recently acquired SoftLayer. In contrast, AWS enjoys mass mindshare with developers. IBM has been trying hard to avoid the cloud-as-a-commodity mind-set, championed by leading cloud providers, by differentiating its cloud offerings.IBM, together with cloud players such as SAP, offers gilt-edged cloud services, with a price to match. In IBM's case, the major differentiator is its SoftLayer bare-metal capabilities. IBM has to walk a tightrope between remaining competitive as a cloud vendor and devaluing its core brand. That could be why the company took so long to announce its price cuts, and why the announcement was low-key.IBM has been trying to parlay its niche cloud into enterprise deals. Although the company must have been hurt by the loss of the $600 million CIA deal to AWS last February, Big Blue has been wining elsewhere. The company signed a $600 million seven-year cloud outsourcing deal with energy provider NiSource that involves implementing a hybrid cloud using SoftLayer. IBM's SoftLayer has a strong focus on IaaS and hybrid clouds, which is a good thing since indications are that the future of the cloud is hybrid.Gartner estimates that the cloud computing market was worth $131 billion in 2013. IaaS and PaaS are the most commonly referenced public cloud segments. IaaS has a 5.5% share of the cloud market, compared to 1% for PaaS. There are growing concerns that the PaaS market could be consolidating, with many IaaS and SaaS vendors already offering PaaS-like solutions. It appears, therefore, as if public clouds with a strong Iaas focus, such as SoftLayer, will be favored more by industry trends.Revenue cliffIBM has experienced a worrying revenue decline for the last eight consecutive quarters. The company reported revenue of $22.48 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, the lowest quarterly revenue in five years, or a 3.9% year-over-year decline. Its net income fell a jaw-dropping 21.4% to $2.38 billion, while diluted GAAP EPS declined 15.4% to $2.29.IBM's hardware business, including servers and systems storage, seems to be disintegrating. Revenue from the segment fell 23% to $2.4 billion. Practically all of the company's server segments fared badly -- System-Z revenue tumbled 40%, power systems revenue declined 21%, and System-X revenue fell 17%.IBM's System-Z mainframe business still commands a strong market position. It is, unfortunately, in the final stages of its product cycle, hence the huge revenue decline. The power systems business serves high-end Unix and Linux computing customers who have been migrating to bladed white-box data center environments, impinging on the sector's growth. Meanwhile, performance of the low-end System-X business has been faltering with the planned sale of the x86 server business to Lenovo.IBM is, however, betting big on the cloud to drive new growth for the company.Betting big on the cloudIBM's cloud business is, by far, the most promising of all its businesses. The company's cloud revenue expanded 80% in the first quarter, with the annual run rate of cloud-delivered-as-service growing 100% year over year to $2.3 billion. The revenue was almost as big as that from the company's server division.SOURCE: SYNERGY RESEARCH GROUPA lot of growth in IBM's cloud service is inorganic (from acquisitions). The company spent $3.1 billion last year to acquire 10 cloud companies. But, the overall cloud market is also growing at a brisk pace, up 20% last year to $131 billion. IBM Market Intelligence estimates that the cloud market will reach $200 billion by 2020.IBM's cloud business grew 69% in fiscal 2013 to $4.4 billion. Allowing for a more modest 25% growth through 2020, the business will reach annual revenue of $16.8 billion by 2020, or nearly 17% of its current annual revenue.In the short term, it might take three years for growth in the sector to balance out declines in the company's overall revenue, assuming that it holds steady at the current rate of 50% per annum.Foolish bottom lineIBM is betting big on its cloud to drive new growth. The company cut its cloud prices to remain competitive, and its gilt-edged cloud services should help differentiate it from rivals."
1 Blue Chip Stock I'd Never Own,"Nov 4, 2014 at 3:30PM","When oneabout blue chip tech stocks, ""Big Blue"" IBM (NYSE:IBM) is always one of the first companies that comes to mind. While some investors might think of IBM as a ""buy it and forget it"" dividend stock which should at least keep pace with the market, it's actually underperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years.SOURCE: YCHARTS.When I take a closer look at IBM, I see a confused company with stagnant top line growth, a ""slash and burn"" approach to its businesses, and muddy plans for the future. That being said, let's talk about why IBM is one blue chip stock I'd never buy.IBM's identity crisisLast year, IBM's revenue fell 4.6% as its net income slipped 0.7%. Last quarter, revenue from continuing operations fell 4% year-over-year -- its tenth consecutive decline -- as net income fell 17%.IBM's strategy over the past decade has been the same -- to sell off lower margin or non-performing businesses. The company sold its PC and x86 server businesses to Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY), its U2 database business to Rocket Software, its point-of-sales business to Toshiba TEC, and its customer care unit to Synnex (NYSE:SNX). IBM also quietly abandoned its SDN (software networking defined) business earlier this year and paid Globalfoundries $1.5 billion to take its unprofitable chip manufacturing unit in October. While these strategies protected IBM's bottom line over the past five years (until last quarter), they barely improved its top line growth.SOURCE: YCHARTS.IBM is heavily banking on the cloud to eventually offset losses from its other businesses. Last year, IBM acquired SoftLayer Technologies for $2 billion to expand its cloud-based footprint, then committed an additional $1.2 billion to expand its data centers and services. It also invested $1 billion in creating a new business unit for Watson, its Jeopardy-playing AI which can quickly analyze cloud-based data. Unfortunately, the cloud business simply isn't growing fast enough. During the third quarter, IBM's cloud offerings had an annual run rate of $3.1 billion, up from $2.8 billion in the second quarter. But that's a drop in the pond for a company which reported nearly $100 billion in revenues last year.Meanwhile, IBM's core businesses are mostly posting declines. Sales from its global services segment, which accounts for 61% of its top line, fell 3% last quarter. Its backlog also slipped 7% year-over-year, indicating that competitors like Accenture (NYSE:ACN) are taking a bite of its business services market. Sales of software, which account for 25% of IBM's revenue, also dropped 2% as demand for its middleware products dried up.The $20 promiseFormer CEO Sam Palmisano's introduced his ""Roadmap 2015"" plan in 2010, which set the five-year goal of doubling earnings per share from $10.01 in 2009 to $20 by 2015. The plan sounded so solid that Warren Buffett invested $10 billion in the company in 2011, despite his well-known aversion to tech stocks.Unfortunately, that plan resulted in a blind dedication to grow its bottom line, at any cost, without long-term plans (besides the cloud) for top line growth. IBM also increased stock buybacks, but they were funded by debt, causing its long-term debt to spike over the past five years:SOURCE: YCHARTS.The big problem with Palmisano's $20 promise was that he made it at a time when IBM was streamlining its business for growth. Therefore, instead of buying back shares ($13.9 billion in 2013), IBM should have acquired more cloud-based companies to accelerate the growth of its cloud business. Ginni Rometty, who succeeded Palmisano in 2012, recently continued that tradition by boosting IBM's buyback plan by $5 billion after its dismal third quarter earnings. Looking ahead, IBM reduced its free cash flow forecast from $13 billion to $12 billion for the year. It will also cut additional jobs, which will result in a fourth quarter charge of up to $600 million.But most importantly, IBM abandoned Palmisano's $20 promise, only stating that it would provide an updated 2015 forecast in January.The road aheadOver the next few years, IBM will likely endure more top and bottom line declines as it struggles to appease shareholders with buybacks while hoping that its investments in the cloud pay off.There are bright spots on the horizon, including its partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which helps its cloud-based services piggyback on iPads into more businesses, and Watson's rising profile in hospitals, but they simply aren't enough to offset IBM's core problems. IBM might eventually bounce back if it invests more in inorganic growth instead of burning all the furniture, but I just don't see that happening under the current management.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Warren Buffett’s 3 Biggest Mistakes,"Nov 24, 2014 at 8:30AM","Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) is one of the greatest investors of all time, but he has certainly made mistakes along the way. Our analysts thought these three were among his biggest.Patrick Morris: Like all of us, Warren Buffett has made mistakes. And he has honestly admitted to his biggest.When discussing the investments Berkshire Hathaway held in the 2003 Letter to Shareholders, Buffett noted:We are neither enthusiastic nor negative about the portfolio we hold. We own pieces of excellent businesses...but their current prices reflect their excellence. The unpleasant corollary to this conclusion is that I made a big mistake in not selling several of our larger holdings during The Great Bubble. If these stocks are fully priced now, you may wonder what I was thinking four years ago when their intrinsic value was lower and their prices far higher. So do I.As the stock market ran up during ""The Great Bubble,"" Berkshire saw its investment portfolio climb to a total value of $41.6 billion in June of 1998. At the end of 2002, it was still languishing, valued at just $28.4 billion:Even more striking is the fact that the total return -- when considering the cost of the investments -- was essentially cut in half, falling from 400% in the middle of 1998 to 210% at the end of 2002.And while Buffett recently admitted he would never sell his stake in Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), it is the prime example in the Berkshire portfolio of both rises and falls in value during The Great Bubble. Berkshire never bought or sold a single share of the company during this time, but as you can see, despite the number of shares owned never wavering, its value certainly changed:Interestingly enough, the end of September 2014 marked the first time Berkshire's stake in Coca-Cola surpassed where it stood in June of 1998. You have to imagine Buffett wishes that 15 years ago he didn't have an insistence on never selling a single of of the 400 million Coca-Cola shares Berkshire holds.Timing the market is a tremendously dangerous game and never recommended. And hopefully we will never see anything like The Great Bubble for decades and decades to come. But in the case of Buffett and Berkshire, it turns out not selling during one of those bubbles can present just as big of a risk as buying.Leo Sun: IBM (NYSE:IBM) was, notably, Warren Buffett's first tech stock. In 2011, Berkshire Hathaway took a $10.7 billion stake in IBM. Today, that investment is down over $1 billion.Buffett invested in IBM because he was impressed by CEO Sam Palmisano's plan for doubling annual earnings per share from $10.01 in 2009 to $20 by 2015. But when Palmisano made that bold promise, IBM should have been acquiring more companies to revive its stagnant top line. Instead, IBM continued to shrink as it shed its lower margin businesses to protect its bottom line. Palmisano's successor, Ginni Rometty, finally acquired cloud computing company SoftLayer Technologies for $2 billion last year, then invested $1.2 billion in a new business unit for its AI platform Watson in January.Those investments will help IBM grow its cloud business, but progress remains sluggish. Last quarter, IBM's cloud business had an annual run rate of $3.1 billion -- a tiny drop compared to IBM's revenue of nearly $100 billion last year. Meanwhile, IBM's slow death march continues -- last quarter, revenue from continuing operations dropped for the tenth consecutive quarter as net income plunged 17%. On the bright side, Rometty wisely abandoned Palmisano's $20 promise.Jordan Wathen: Buffett points out that he's made more errors of omission than commission. That is, he's missed more great companies than he's bought bad companies.Perhaps the worst error of omission was Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Buffett was buying big during the 1990s. He set out with the goal of buying the equivalent of 200 million shares, then trading at a split-adjusted price of $11.50 each. As he was buying, the price moved just pennies over his ideal price of $11.50 per split-adjusted share. He stopped buying.  As a result, he missed out on a share price move that would cost Berkshire Hathaway billions of dollars in lost opportunity. He valued the lost gains at more than $10 billion in 2004, which would be many billions more today. For the record, Wal-Mart shares now trade at about $85 each, and that doesn't even begin to include dividends paid over time.  Even Buffett, probably the best person in the world at valuing businesses, gets a little too attached to his ideal prices every once in awhile. And while the loss won't appear on the income statement at Berkshire Hathaway, it may be one of the biggest mistakes in his investing career."
How Apple & IBM Could Conquer the Business World,"Jul 21, 2014 at 2:30PM","Thirty years ago, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) were arch-enemies. But now, like the Federation and the Klingons, they've formed an alliance that could help Apple expand into a whole new universe: the enterprise market.This week on 1-Up on Wall Street, the Motley Fool's weekly video show about turning geek enthusiasm into great investments, guest host Allison Southwick and analysts Tim Beyers and Nathan Alderman discuss what this new pact to create software and sell support for iDevices might mean for Apple and IBM. Tim notes that this move would never have happened under Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' tenure, and marks yet another bold move from his successor as CEO, Tim Cook.

Why Cisco Is the Ultimate Internet of Things Stock for 2015,"Dec 29, 2014 at 9:07AM","Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), one of the largest networking companies in the world, generates nearly $50 billion in annual revenue by connecting devices to one another. This makes Cisco a natural investment in the Internet of Things, or IoT, the digital framework that will connect smart objects such as appliances, watches, and cars to the cloud.Cisco already has an established footprint in IoT infrastructure with its Unified Computing Systems converged data solutions and network security software. However, the company has generally lagged IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) when it comes to analyzing that data for organizations. That's why Cisco recently launched its new ""Connected Analytics for the Internet of Everything"" initiative, which integrates data analytics capabilities into its existing network hardware.Why Cisco's competitors should worryCisco controls over 40% of the global enterprise networking and communication market by revenue, according to Infonetics Research. Infonetics also reported that Cisco was the only major networking company to offer products across every major project category (networking, communication, and security) in the enterprise networking market.This expansive reach lets Cisco aggressively bundle its products and services. An organization will likely save money by buying a bundle of routers, switches, and security software from Cisco rather than buying the technology separately from multiple companies. Many of Cisco's smaller competitors, such as Aruba Networks, have been bruised by these bundling tactics.Adding IoT analytics -- which target a wide range of retail, telecommunications, and smart cities -- could help Cisco compete against IBM and Oracle, which lack Cisco's 70% plus market share in routers and switches. Cisco's approach is also potentially disruptive to IBM and Oracle's analytics businesses, as their current services are focused on analyzing past events rather than real-time developments.Why Cisco investors shouldn't celebrate yetCisco estimates the IoT market will grow from 25 billion connected devices in 2015 to 50 billion devices by 2020. Over the next 10 years, Cisco expects the value of the IoT industry to hit $19 trillion, with $7.3 trillion coming from analytics solutions alone.For Cisco, expanding its IoT business is less about market growth potential than dominating a major market transition. The company previously leveraged its dominant market share in routers and switches to increase its security solutions business. It is using that same strategy to connect those customers with its IoT and Big Data markets.But all that bundling weighs down Cisco's bottom line. In fiscal 2014, Cisco's total revenue from products and services declined 3% year-over-year to $47.1 billion, and net income plunged 21%. Last quarter, Cisco's revenue rose 1.3% year-over-year, but net income fell 8.4% due to weak sales in emerging markets, with a notable 33% decline in China.It's hard for Cisco to improve its bottom line, since it constantly lowers price expectations for its products with bundles. Competitive pressure from its biggest adversary in China, Huawei, also prevents it from raising prices on its routers and switches.The true future of the IoTCisco's IoT predictions might be bold, but much could change over the next decade. A surge in hacks, data breaches, and accusations of cyberspying could prevent organizations from flooding the market with constantly connected devices.Alarming reports have also emerged regarding the hackability of smart cars and homes. Nissan recently investigated claims that its Infiniti Q50 could be theoretically hacked and controlled via Bluetooth. In August, a team of security researchers reportedly hacked Google's Nest -- the central hub of its smart home system -- within 15 seconds.However, stories like this could fuel stronger demand for more securely connected IoT devices with real-time data analytics, which would be a boon to Cisco.What does this mean for Cisco investors?Long-term Cisco investors should look at the big picture. Although the company's bottom line will remain under pressure as it bundles and integrates various products and services, this strategy keeps its challengers at bay. As Cisco's market share in IoT security and analytics grows, so could its pricing power.That change will take time, but Cisco knows how to reward patient investors. The company has raised its dividend annually since the payout was introduced in 2011, and it currently pays a forward annual dividend yield of 2.8% to those willing to look beyond its bottom-line and emerging-market issues.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Warren Buffett Owns IBM Corp. Stock but Not Apple Inc. Stock,"May 1, 2015 at 11:24AM","Warren Buffett surprised the investing world when he purchased $11.8 billion worth of IBM (NYSE:IBM) stock for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) in 2011, ending the Oracle of Omaha's long-standing aversion to technology companies. Since then, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) share price dropped from a split-adjusted $100 to $55 before rising to $130, yet Buffett never touched the stock.While we can't know exactly why he felt secure buying IBM but not Apple, Buffett's many letters, articles, and interviews offer insight into why he stayed away from the iDevice maker -- and why you might want to do the same.An innovative companyA November 1999 Buffett article for Fortune magazine provides a glimpse at his thoughts on tech stocks during their heyday:The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors.Perhaps no other industry experiences change and upheaval of the kind that define the tech sector. The dominant companies of the 1980s were slayed by the newer technology that created the giants of the 1990s. Those giants, too, gave way to Apple, Google, and the other tech masters of the new millennium.Nobody knows what the industry will look like 10 years from today, but it will almost certainly be much changed. Just 14 years ago, Apple was a struggling company that introduced a new music player, the iPod. Now, the company is the leading consumer electronics company thanks to its iPhones, iPads, Watches, and other innovative devices.Apple is on top of the tech industry today, but its business and the sector it operates in will change so much in the coming years that it's hard to say if it can remain the leader in the decades ahead. If a company must constantly reinvent itself to stay on top, it likely does not pass Buffett's moat test -- which any technology company would find difficult to pass.Did Buffett change his criteria?Buffett wrote that Fortune article 16 years ago, but his IBM purchase occurred just four years back. It's possible he relaxed his investing criteria to make the purchase. Compared to Berkshire holdings GEICO (insurance) and Burlington Northern (railroad), IBM changes a lot. But it is also one of the most predictable companies in the tech sector. Look at IBM's 10-year sales trend and compare it to Apple's:SOURCE: MORNINGSTAR.Apple is growing much faster than IBM, but Big Blue has a much more stable revenue stream while it buys back millions of shares. Buffett wrote in Berkshire's 2011 letter to shareholders that he expected IBM to retain its earning power despite the tech sector's proclivity for rapid change: ""We expect the combined earnings of [American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM, and Wells Fargo] -- and their dividends as well -- to increase in 2012 and, for that matter, almost every year for a long time to come.""Clearly, Buffett is still using the same criteria he employed to build Berkshire into the behemoth it is today. The only change is that he sees qualities he likes in a company that operates in a sector that he is famous for avoiding.Why IBM but not Apple?The reasons for Buffett's choice of IBM rather than Apple are likely mundane. The chances of severely overestimating the earning power of slow-growing IBM are much lower than the chances of being too optimistic about Apple's future.Apple's products are updated regularly to remain state of the art, while IBM's product cycle is much slower. It's hard to know what products Apple will be selling in 10 years, much less what it will earn. IBM's relatively slow and predictable path toward cloud computing is much clearer. Buffett has some idea of what IBM will sell and earn a decade from now, while he isn't so sure about Apple. The best investor in the world believes that makes IBM a better investment than Apple; individual investors should consider this possibility as well."
"IBM Used To Be Bigger Than Apple, What Happened?","Apr 11, 2015 at 11:00AM","With a market cap just over $730 billion, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest company in corporate history.It's also the largest component of the S&P 500 by a fairly sizable margin. Apple makes up around 4% of the stock index -- and its recent surge has been a significant contributor to the index's rally.S&P 500 VS. APPLE TOTAL RETURN, DATA BY YCHARTSBut on a historical basis, other firms have been more significant. Apple's once fierce foe IBM (NYSE:IBM) dominated the S&P 500 in the mid-1980s, accounting for (at one point) as much as 6% of the index.But shortly thereafter, IBM's business collapsed, and the company was forced to reinvent itself. What happened, and should Apple shareholders be concerned?Apple's 1984 adApple's iconic 1984 Super Bowl ad serves as a key symbol of IBM's power in the mid-1980s. For roughly three decades, IBM had been the dominant supplier of computer technology to corporate buyers. IBM was so dominant, in fact, that the Justice Department pursued the company for a dozen years on antitrust grounds before ultimately dropping the case in 1981.Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, businesses were addicted to IBM's high-margin mainframes. The nascent personal computer revolution threatened to topple IBM's dominance, but the company appeared to be setting itself up to commandeer that market as well.Apple's 1984 ad for the then upcoming Macintosh appeared to take a shot at IBM, likening the company to the nefarious Big Brother from George Orwell's literary masterpiece.The PC revolution brings IBM to its kneesThe ad proved prophetic. Although the Macintosh itself didn't bring down IBM, the machine was ultimately successful in igniting the personal computing revolution -- a revolution that undermined IBM's power and sapped it of its profits.IBM's earnings began to slide in 1985. It blamed a variety of factors, including a sluggish economy, but within a few years it became obvious -- personal computers were taking a toll on the demand for its mainframes, and the company had no answer.Profits became losses in the early 1990s, and in 1992, IBM reported what was then the largest annual loss in American corporate history: $4.96 billion. From 1987 to 1993, IBM's stock -- which had long been considered the very definition of a blue chip -- shed more than half of its value.S&P 500 VS. IBM PERFORMANCE, DATA BY YCHARTSIn the long-run, IBM was able to recover, reinventing itself by ditching hardware and embracing software and services. But any investor who bought IBM in early 1986 lost money over the next few years, and has underperformed the S&P 500 to this day.S&P 500 VS. IBM TOTAL RETURN, DATA BY YCHARTSShould Apple shareholders be concerned?The IBM of the 1980s and Apple today do share some modest similarities. Other than the fact that they're both technology companies, both firms managed to generate record earnings on the back of high-margin, highly integrated hardware.But that's where the differences end. IBM was primarily selling to businesses, and its own products were eventually upended by cheaper, better alternatives. Apple sells its gadgets mostly to consumers, and has yet to face significant low-cost rivals, although cheaper Android handsets from China could eventually pose a significant risk.It may be more of a technical argument than a fundamental one, but DoubleLine's Jeff Gundlach (via Business Insider) pointed out last month that owning the largest component of the S&P 500 has never been a wise investment. Whether it's IBM or ExxonMobil, since 1972, the largest member of the S&P 500 has consistently under-performed the rest of the index on a total return basis.Apple could be the first company to defy that trend, but it's something shareholders should definitely keep in mind.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here's Why IBM Is Still Building Mainframes,"Jan 24, 2015 at 3:10PM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) sold off large portions of its hardware business in 2014. The company no longer sells the Intel-based servers that dominate the data center, and it no longer manufactures its own processors. Despite this shift away from hardware, IBM remains committed to its mainframes, the hulking, expensive computer systems that centralize computing instead of distributing it across a large number of inexpensive Intel-powered machines.Earlier this month, IBM announced its newest mainframe, the z13. IBM spent $1 billion and five years designing the system, which it calls the most powerful and secure mainframe ever built. Aimed squarely at providing the back end necessary to process the deluge of transactions made from mobile devices, the z13 can process 2.5 billion transactions per day, offering both real-time encryption and embedded analytics. The system's price tag wasn't disclosed, but IBM's high-end mainframes can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars or more.Z13 MAINFRAME. SOURCE: IBM.With vast arrays of relatively cheap Intel servers becoming the norm, why is IBM still cranking out hugely expensive mainframes?The mainframe is far from deadMany companies still rely on IBM's mainframes, and it's not just the hassle of switching to an alternative that keeps them with Big Blue. Mainframes are built specifically for mission-critical applications, such as processing banking transactions, where both reliability and security are paramount. The systems are designed with redundancies and backups built in: if a component fails, it can be swapped out without affecting the system. Due to this design, IBM's mainframes have a mean time between failure measured in decades.IBM's mainframes have also kept up with the times. The systems have long supported Linux, and they also support OpenStack, a popular open-source cloud computing platform. This means a private cloud can be run directly on a mainframe, with the z13 supporting up to 8,000 Linux virtual machines simultaneously. IBM claims that running a private cloud on the z13 comes with a 49% lower total cost of ownership than a comparable private cloud running on an array of Intel servers.While mainframes have a higher up-front cost than Intel servers, given the right workload they can deliver significant savings. A recent New York Times article cited Radixx International, which operates the computerized reservation systems for 40 small and midsize airlines, as an example of a company that saved money by switching to IBM mainframes. The company's CEO said the total cost of ownership of the new mainframes is about 50% lower than that of the company's sprawling server farm.Nationwide Insurance also saved money with IBM's mainframes. In 2005, the company was faced with the prospect of building a new data center in order to accommodate growth. Instead, it switched to using the virtualization technology available on IBM's mainframes, allowing Nationwide to save millions of dollars per year. Additional cost savings were achieved through the reduced need for floor space, networking hardware, etc..Companies have shifted from managing their own infrastructure to outsourcing to public clouds operated by companies such as Amazon.com. However, mission-critical workloads that typically run on mainframes aren't a good match for public clouds, because mainframes are far more reliable. Public clouds such as Amazon's Amazon Web Services sometimes undergo unscheduled outages, and often the system must be rebooted in order to apply security patches or upgrades. For companies that require 100% uptime, public clouds simply aren't feasible.Most companies that buy a new z13 mainframe will likely be existing IBM customers upgrading their systems, but IBM might win some converts as well. While mainframe hardware sales account for a small portion of IBM's revenue, the software and services surrounding the mainframe account for as much of 35% of the company's operating profit, according to an analyst from Bernstein Research.IBM's mainframes play a key role, one that is extremely unlikely to be usurped by cheap commodity hardware. Industries continue to rely on mainframes because they are genuinely the best option, in terms of reliability, security, and often cost. IBM's $1 billion investment in the z13 aims to keep it that way.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Watson Is a Major Opportunity for IBM,"Feb 26, 2015 at 11:00AM","As International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) adapts to the rise of cloud computing, the company is focusing on its strengths, building a strategy around high-value services instead of commodity infrastructure. One of these services is Watson, the cognitive computing system IBM originally built to parse and interpret natural language on the game show Jeopardy.Watson is now available as a cloud service, offering more than a dozen different features for those developing applications, like text-to-speech and visual recognition, where the system can determine the contents of an image or video without any other information. Watson is a machine learning system, which means it needs to be trained to perform specific tasks by being fed huge amounts of data.IBM has high hopes for Watson. The company has invested more than $1 billion in the Watson group, including $100 million dedicated to venture investments in companies building Watson-powered applications. CEO Virginia Rometty has said she hopes Watson will become a $10 billion business for IBM within 10 years.While Watson is nowhere close to being that big today, the system is being used in a variety of interesting ways. Other companies, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), have introduced products that use machine learning as well, so it's clear that IBM isn't alone in thinking that a system like Watson has real potential. Here are a few ways Watson is being used today, and what it means for IBM.An IBM cookbook and a cloud-powered toyIn a couple of months, a cookbook titled Cognitive Cooking with Chef Watson will be released, the result of a partnership between IBM and the Institute of Culinary Education. All of the recipes in the cookbook, some of which are already available, were created with the help of Watson. Vast amounts of recipe and ingredient data were fed into the system, and Watson was able to analyze the relationships between ingredients and come up with novel combinations.SOURCE: AMAZONResulting recipes include an Austrian Chocolate Burrito, a beef burrito featuring both dark chocolate and apricot, and a Vienamese-Apple-Kebab. In total, the cookbook will feature 65 original recipes created by Watson, and future applications of the system could include helping those with dietary restrictions.Another interesting application of Watson is in the toy industry. Elemental Path, a company that entered and won IBM's Watson Mobile App Developer Challenge, is currently working to bring its Watson-powered CogniToys to market. CogniToys connect to Watson in the cloud, allowing children to interact by asking the toy questions and receiving answers. Watson can provide different content based on the age of the child, and parents can control the content through a web portal.SOURCE: ELEMENTAL PATH.Elemental Path is currently running a Kickstarter campaign for the toy, expected to start shipping in November, and the project has already more than tripled its goal. Whether these toys work as intended remains to be seen, but if successful, CogniToys could create a whole new category of toys, with IBM at the center.The potential of machine learningWhile cognitive cooking and smart toys are unlikely to move the needle for IBM, it's the long-term potential of machine learning that represents a big opportunity for the company. Already, Watson is being used in industries ranging from health care to finance, and with the service available in the cloud, any developer can build machine learning applications.IBM's business is helping other businesses, and Watson offers tools meant to help businesses succeed. Watson can be used to analyze the risk of employees leaving the company, for example, allowing human resources to intervene and have a better chance at retaining top employees. In marketing, Watson can analyze campaigns and rank leads in order to maximize conversion rates.These are just a few examples of what Watson can do, and IBM is actively expanding the capabilities of the system. IBM isn't alone, though, in recognizing the potential of machine learning. Microsoft recently launched its own machine learning service on its Azure cloud platform, allowing developers to create cloud-based applications, targeting the same types of use cases IBM is targeting with Watson. One example service provided by Microsoft allows companies to predict when a customer is likely to end a subscription, allowing the company to attempt to retain them.NVIDIA is also using a machine learning system, although in a far more specialized manner. The graphics company recently unveiled its in-car computer system, which uses cameras and machine learning to detect specific objects, like stop signs and pedestrians. Semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles will need to be able to accurately evaluate the environment, and machine learning makes this possible.Machine learning is one area where IBM is ahead of the curve, and it seems very likely that machine learning will become an increasingly important technology going forward. Microsoft's challenge to Watson, while introducing competition, validates IBM's decision to focus heavily on the technology. As IBM plods through its current transition, machine learning and Watson represent a major growth opportunity for the century-old company.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Brilliance Behind IBM's China Strategy,"Apr 1, 2015 at 12:46PM","As the world's most populous country, not to mention an economy that has consistently grown at a staggering rate relative to the rest of the world, it's no wonder tech companies are chomping at the bit to gain a foothold with businesses and consumers in China. The opportunities for the tech industry -- across multiple areas including cloud services, devices, and the Internet of Things, to name but a few -- are huge.However, China's highly regulated governmental oversight, concerns surrounding tech security, and a growing sense that ""outsiders"" are less than welcome have made doing business in China challenging, to say the least. In what is likely a precursor of things to come, IBM (NYSE:IBM) CEO Ginni Rometty is taking a unique approach to gaining a foothold in China; and it's spot on.What's the big deal?The reason IBM and virtually every other significant tech company on the planet are targeting China as a means for growth is the nation's phenomenal appetite for technology. According to IDC, China will account for 43% of the world's information and communication technology sales growth this year.Included in that astounding figure, per IDC, Chinese consumers are expected to make one-third of all smartphone purchases and to conduct one-third of all online shopping.However, the Chinese government also recognizes the limitless opportunities its consumers represent, and has seemingly gone out of its way to make it difficult for foreign companies such as IBM and its competitors to sell their wares.China is focused on growing its own tech industry rather than simply becoming a significant sales destination for foreign companies. Also, Edward Snowden's revelations regarding U.S. National Security Agency activities added fuel to the anti-foreign fire. Non-Chinese tech companies, thanks to Snowden's insights, brought with them security concerns that raised yet another roadblock for outsiders. In fact, a report from Gartner suggests that over 80% of Southeast Asian CIOs don't believe their companies are adequately protected from digital security breaches. So what's a foreign tech behemoth like IBM to do? Take an entirely different tack.IBM has a planRather than ""viewing the country [China] solely as a sales destination or manufacturing base,"" which has been par for the course for device manufacturers such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and most every other tech giant, Rometty and team intend to actively assist China in developing its own tech industry. That is a significant shift in strategy, but there is a method to Rometty's madness.The over-the-top ad recently displayed by billionaire Internet video site founder Jia Yueting that included, among other negative connotations, a statement that ""Apple is Hitler"" speaks volumes about the challenges facing foreign companies in China. Sure, Jia is rumored to be entering the smartphone market, so taking a stab at Apple was self-serving, and the manner in which he did so was ridiculous, but the message was clear: buy ""in-house."" That's not so different from the ""Made in America"" mantra so many U.S. companies market.Rather than fight China's heightened governmental regulations and growing consumer angst regarding foreign products and services, IBM will work with Chinese companies as they build everything from servers to chips, all utilizing IBM architecture. As Rometty put it, ""I think some firms find that perhaps frightening. We, though, at IBM ... find that to be a great opportunity,"" and she couldn't be more right.Chinese banking regulators have mandated that the nation's financial institutions use more ""made in China"" technologies: that's how focused its government is on weaning itself off foreign technology. IBM's approach, along with the development of strategic partnerships with several Chinese tech companies, is a way to participate in the world's largest market even as others are being squeezed out.Going forward, investors would be wise to monitor revenue from IBM's China efforts. Big Blue is finally beginning to stem its losses in China -- IBM's revenue from the nation declined a mere 1% year over year in Q4 2014 -- and with Rometty's plans now in full-swing, growth won't be far off.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

SWOT Analysis of International Business Machines Corp.,"May 7, 2015 at 8:30AM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) is often considered a safe and conservative tech stock, but the company has certainly seen better days.Big Blue recently reported its 12th consecutive quarter of declining revenues. Its stock has fallen 9% over the past 12 months, dramatically underperforming the S&P 500's 12% gain. Nonetheless, the stock is fairly cheap at 11 times forward earnings, and it has a decent forward annual dividend yield of 2.7%. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), IBM's single largest shareholder, remains bullish on IBM's long-term prospects.SOURCE: IBM.So let's do a basic SWOT (strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats) analysis of IBM to determine its business prospects.StrengthsIBM's core strengths are its five ""strategic imperatives"" -- its cloud, data analytics, mobile, social, and security businesses. Revenue from those businesses climbed 16% annually last year and accounted for 27% of IBM's top-line.Last quarter, strategic imperatives revenue rose 30% year-over-year. IBM expects annual revenue from those businesses to hit $40 billion by 2018, which would account for nearly half of its projected annual revenue. To keep that growth on track, IBM will invest $4 billion on those businesses throughout this year.Within the cloud unit, demand for hybrid cloud installations will likely grow. Hybrid cloud installations combine local and cloud-based services for larger businesses which aren't ready to move all their data to the cloud yet. Research firm Gartner (NYSE:IT) estimates that half of all U.S. companies will use hybrid cloud installations by 2017.WeaknessesIBM's strategic initiatives are growing at a healthy rate, but its core businesses aren't. Last quarter, revenue at all five of IBM's main business units -- Global Technology Services, Global Business Services, Software, Systems Hardware, and Global Financing -- declined annually, contributing to its companywide 12% top-line decline.IBM's revenue growth has stalled due to weak client spending, sluggish demand in the software sector, a strong dollar eating up its overseas revenues, and divestments of lower margin businesses. Divesting lower margin businesses like low-end servers and its foundry business improved earnings per share, but it also caused revenue growth to dry up. CEO Ginni Rometty referred to those revenues as ""empty calories,"" but without them, IBM's top-line growth will remain weak.IBM's dependence on large businesses is also a double-edged sword. Large businesses are heavily dependent on IBM's mainframes, services, and software, but they are all fairly expensive compared to solutions for smaller businesses. This means that fluctuations in client spending, affected by various economic factors, could weigh down IBM's top-line growth.OpportunitiesOn the bright side, IBM's investments in strategic imperatives have expanded its business into interesting new areas. Last year, it invested $1 billion to launch a dedicated business unit for Watson, its data-processing AI platform. Rometty believes that the unit can generate $10 billion in annual revenue within a decade.IBM also invested $1.2 billion in bolstering its cloud-based businesses. New partnerships, like ones with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), could also strengthen that business with co-developed cloud-based middleware and apps.Earlier this year, IBM established a new Internet of Things (IoT) unit, pledging to invest $3 billion in the business over the next four years. Those investments could give IBM a foothold in the booming IoT market, which IDC expects to grow from $1.9 trillion to $7.1 trillion between 2013 and 2020.Lastly, IBM is licensing out its designs for semiconductor chips, servers, and software to tech firms in emerging markets like China. Members of that program, known as Open Power, provide base technologies to overseas firms to forge new overseas partnerships.ThreatsThe greatest threat to IBM's future is competition in the cloud. The fastest growing part of IBM's cloud business, its ""cloud as a service"" business, had an annual run rate of $3.8 billion last quarter. Total cloud revenues rose 60% to $7.7 billion.That growth sounds impressive, but competing services are growing just as quickly. Revenue at Amazon's AWS unit, which competes against IBM's ""cloud as a service"" business, rose 49% annually with an annual run rate of $6 billion last quarter. Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) commercial cloud revenue rose 106% annually with an annual run rate of $3.8 billion last quarter. Microsoft didn't disclose how much revenue came from the Azure cloud service -- which competes directly against AWS and IBM's cloud services -- but Deutsche Bank estimates that the service generates $500 million to $700 million in annual revenues.IBM's Watson also faces stiff competition in predictive analytics, which help businesses identify trends and predict customer behavior. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOG) uses its Prediction API, Microsoft has Azure ML (machine learning), and Amazon recently launched Amazon ML. Those services and others could derail IBM's optimistic growth forecasts for its strategic imperatives.The verdictIBM's downside potential is fairly limited, but so is its upside. But if the company's strategic imperatives stay on track, it could evolve into a radically different business with much higher growth by the end of the decade. If that happens, IBM's current price could seem like a bargain."
Myth-Busting IBM's Growth Problem,"Feb 7, 2015 at 10:25AM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) has been taking a beating lately. Shares have tumbled over 15% in the past six months, and criticism has rained down on the company from seemingly every direction. Stagnant revenue and a heavy reliance on share buybacks to drive earnings growth has led some to conclude IBM is falling behind, unable to adapt to a changing world and dependent on financial engineering to grow.There are plenty of arguments being made against IBM these days -- here is why three common ones are wrong.No. 1: IBM does not invest enough in its businessA common argument is that IBM is returning billions of dollars to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends when it should be investing to grow the business.From fiscal 2009 through 2013, IBM spent $63.7 billion on stock repurchases and paid out $17.3 billion in dividends. During that same period, the company spent $21.2 billion on capital expenditures and $14.3 billion on acquisitions.IBM does not return so much money to shareholders, because it is reluctant to invest. The company simply generates far more operating cash flow (roughly $97 billion from 2009 to 2013) than it could possibly put back into its business at a reasonable rate of return, and the result is that much of this cash flow is returned to shareholders.IBM does not seek to grow revenue at all costs, spending billions on questionable acquisitions and initiatives. It could have made some massive purchases over the past five years, greatly boosting revenue. But the return on investment would have almost certainly been abysmal.Huge acquisitions often turn out poorly. Consider Hewlett-Packard, which spent $18.6 billion on such deals over the past five years. The result? Revenue is down 11.5% and net income has fallen a whopping 43% over that period. On top of that, HP was forced to take a massive $18 billion asset impairment charge in 2012 related to its failed acquisitions. IBM has largely avoided these types of disastrous transactions.Investing the amount of money IBM earns each year is easy. The hard part is investing in places where the potential return on investment is exceptional. IBM invests plenty in its business. It is only the company's incredible success in growing its earnings over the past decade, giving it the ability to return billions to shareholders each year, that makes it appear otherwise.No. 2: Earnings growth has been the result of financial engineeringAnother criticism of IBM is that the massive amount of money spent on share buybacks has been the primary driver behind earnings growth over the last decade. It is true that buybacks have boosted earnings per share, but such a claim ignores IBM's margin expansion as it shifted its business model to more profitable segments.Between the end of 2004 and the end of 2014, IBM reduced its share count from 1.7 billion to 995 million. This is a nearly 42% reduction, responsible for a big chunk of EPS growth over the last decade. Had net income remained at 2004 levels, EPS for the company would have grown by about 72% just from the buybacks.But EPS has instead grown by 216% since 2004, thanks also to an 87% increase in net income, driven by a rise in both gross and operating margins. This is not financial engineering. IBM had plenty of cash flow to fund these buybacks, and it paid a reasonable price for its own shares. Here is what IBM's P/E ratio has been over the past decade.IBM P/E Ratio (Annual) data by YChartsParticularly after the financial crisis, IBM got a good deal on its share repurchases, with a P/E ratio in the low-to-mid teens. Plowing cash into its stock made perfect sense. As long as IBM does not take on too much debt to pay for these buybacks, and as long as the share price remains reasonable, the company should be buying back as many shares as it can.No. 3: Debt is piling up thanks to buybacksOn the surface, it looks like IBM has an awful lot of debt sitting on its balance sheet -- $40.8 billion at the end of 2014. This is up from $33.9 billion at the end of 2008.But much of this debt is related to the company's global financing business, which is backed by receivables. Non-GF debt totaled $11.7 billion at the end of 2014, up from $9.6 billion at the end of 2008. That is just a $2 billion increase, despite the tens of billions of dollars spent on share buybacks during that period.IBM has mostly paid for its massive buyback program with cash flow, as well as proceeds from selling off low-margin businesses, not debt. Buybacks have accelerated in recent years, and if IBM keeps up this pace, it might have to raise debt to pay for the program. But as it stands, the balance sheet is strong.There is nothing wrong with repurchasing stock if the price is right, and there is money to pay for it. Both conditions have been true for IBM, and a depressed stock price means the company gets more for its money with each share. And the idea that IBM should spend less on its own shares and more on acquisitions is misguided. Its aversion to expensive purchases of hot tech companies, which often trade at many times sales with little or no profit, is a good quality. The day IBM adopts that kind of strategy is the day that I reconsider being an IBM shareholder.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It isn't hard to search the Internet and find out who the ""most profitable"" American companies are. Unfortunately, it paints a very incomplete picture.There's one big problem with the word ""profit"": it doesn't reflect how much money a company is able to keep in its pockets at the end of each year. That's because a whole slew of accounting gimmicks can go into figuring out ""profit"" -- things like amortization or depreciation -- that have no immediate effect on cash.A far better -- though admittedly not perfect -- measure would be free cash flow. This represents the amount of cash a company is able to generate from continuing operations (its core business), minus any capital expenditures.  You'll see many familiar names in the Top 10 free cash flow generators, but what's astounding is that the number one company has almost twice the cash coming in than its closest competitor.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The 3 Best Stocks to Invest in Information Technology,"May 30, 2015 at 5:40PM","Information technology makes the business world go round. No corporation worth its salt would even attempt nowadays to operate without a variety of computer systems, data networks, custom software packages, and top-notch support services.These markets added up to a stunning $3.7 trillion in worldwide sales last year, and are expected to grow to $3.9 trillion in 2015. That's a massive market, coupled with generous growth prospects.So what are the best ways to invest in this booming industry today? Here's a handpicked selection of three options.INVESTING LEGEND WARREN BUFFETT HAS BUILT AN 8.1% STAKE IN IBM.The grizzled veteranLegendary investor Warren Buffett has a very simple basic philosophy.""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price,"" Buffett says.That's one way to build a billion-dollar fortune. But what if you can buy a wonderful company at a wonderful price? That's what's happening today with IBM (NYSE:IBM). And wouldn't you know it -- Buffett is using this opportunity to increase his IBM position right now.In 2011, Buffett saw IBM as ""a company that helps IT departments do their job better."" He bought into this top-quality business even as the stock hit a series of all-time highs, just like he did in railroads a couple years earlier. In Buffett's eyes, this was a world-class business with fantastic execution chops -- the kind of stock you should own for decades to come.Since then, IBM has been going through a painful strategy adjustment. The company has offloaded most of its computing hardware operations to Chinese peer Lenovo, refocusing on higher-margin software and services instead. Adjusted earnings per share has increased by 7% since 2011 even though sales dropped 15% over the same period. This new direction will take a few years to mature, but should position IBM well for a more profitable future.IBM investors -- Buffett included -- have missed out on a great bull market over the last three and a half years. The stock has traded sideways while the S&P 500 index gained 82%, and that's with dividends reinvested along the way:IBM TOTAL RETURN PRICE, DATA BY YCHARTSLet me repeat that again: IBM's profit is rising while the market hit ""pause"" on the share price. It's still the same great company that Buffett saw in 2011, and he's still buying more IBM shares. But now he's getting the same great business at a discount, since Big Blue these days trades for a very reasonable 12.7 times adjusted earnings. It's the best of both worlds, and this stock should rebound strongly when the software-and-services revamp starts paying off on the bottom line.IMAGE SOURCE: RED HAT.The confident newcomerIBM is a world-beater, selling at a discount. If you'd prefer an up-and-comer with momentum behind both the business and the stock, I'd recommend Red Hat (NYSE:RHT).Shares of the Linux systems vendor are trading at multiyear highs. Over the last 12 months, you're looking at a 56% gain while the S&P 500 only rose by 11%. Sales and free cash flow have just about doubled in four years, providing plenty of fuel for Red Hat's skyrocketing share price.Those are impressive numbers for a company built on freely available and open-source software. Anyone can install Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the company's flagship product, for a free 30-day evaluation, and the system will remain fully functional (but unsupported) when the evaluation period or your last paid subscription license expires.Red Hat also supports Fedora and CentOS, two totally free Linux distributions without professional support contracts. These systems serve as testing grounds and extended development platforms for RHEL. Their presence accelerates the enterprise product's development at a very low cost to Red Hat, and also broadens the company's community of users, developers, and system administrators.The magic sauce that ties it all together, and also fills Red Hat's coffers, is the availability of top-shelf support contracts. Long-term contracts provide a wonderfully stable and predictable revenue flow. Linux in general, and Red Hat's premium products in particular, have finally gone mainstream.At the same time, the company provides a plethora of tools that are proving popular in the emerging Internet of Things market. From lightweight operating systems to secure messaging tools, Red Hat can stick its fingers into that $19 trillion pie from many angles.In short, Red Hat is perfectly positioned to continue growing quickly for a long time. Formerly known as an interesting cost-saving alternative, Linux has become a preferred computing platform. And Red Hat is locking its customers into multiyear relationships.This growth story is just getting started.The plucky upstartFinally, let's talk about Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).I know, the company is famous for its online retailing prowess above all else. Amazon built one of the first real e-commerce platforms, and still innovates in the retail space like nobody else. Seems like an odd choice for a discussion about IT products and services, right?But for the purposes of this article, that online retail operation is only an additional bonus. Call it icing on the cake.We're here to look at Amazon Web Services. The cloud computing platform grew out of Amazon's excess data center capacity in 2006, growing quietly under the radar for years. Nowadays, Amazon breaks this division out as a separate operating segment so we can track what's going on.For example, in the recently reported Q1 2015, AWS sales jumped 49% higher year over year. The segment offers a $6 billion annual revenue run rate at the moment, and is growing fast.The division might be small in the context of Amazon's $91 billion total sales run rate, but Web Services is tremendously profitable. In the third quarter, it provided more than one-third of Amazon's overall operating income.Amazon wins AWS customers by offering a mighty flexible and low-cost computing environment. The company manages all the hardware you need, leaving your company to focus on the business-critical software that is running on these cloud servers. This approach, often known as platform-as-a-service or PaaS, is a new paradigm for information-technology management. Amazon remains a leader in this exploding market, surrounded by a host of big-name challengers.If you're investing in Amazon to get hold of AWS' growth, you'll appreciate the financial stability that comes from the retail side. But I wouldn't be surprised if the Web Services division's profitability eclipsed that of Amazon's retailing operations sometime in the next three or four years. The retail segment's revenue will still dwarf its tech-minded sibling for decades, and perhaps forever.Final wordsI picked all three of these high-quality information technology stocks right out of my own real-money portfolio. Each of these companies is the best at what they do, with many years of predictable growth ahead.Importantly, all three are poised to profit from the Internet of Things megatrend, which will take the IT market to a brand new place over the next five years or so. With trillions of dollars to be made, IBM, Red Hat, and Amazon stand ready to collect several billion each.You don't want to miss that boom, which is happening as we speak.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

General Electric Used to Be Bigger Than Apple -- What Happened?,"Apr 19, 2015 at 11:40AM","With a market cap of just over $730 billion, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable company in history, and the largest component of the S&P 500 by a fairly sizable margin. Apple makes up about 4% of the index -- an historical accomplishment that only a handful of other companies have ever been able to claim.One of those companies is General Electric (NYSE:GE). In fact, GE -- on a relative basis -- was larger. In the year 2000, GE accounted for nearly 5% of the S&P 500. But the industrial giant took a turn for the worse shortly thereafter, and its stock has been a notable underperformer in the years since. Even factoring in sizable dividend payments, GE shares have fallen more than 13% in the last 15 years.GE TOTAL RETURN PRICE, DATA BY YCHARTS.What happened, and should Apple shareholders be concerned by GE's fall?GE's underperformance is a product of its outperformanceAlthough GE shares have performed poorly over the last 15 years, they've actually done relatively well over the last 20. Since the beginning of 1995, including dividends, GE has returned more than 450%.GE TOTAL RETURN PRICE, DATA BY YCHARTS.With perhaps the lone exception of Microsoft under Bill Gates, during the second half of the 1990s, GE was the greatest company in the world led by the world's greatest CEO. Despite its already mammoth size, GE was growing revenue and earnings at around 20% annually back then. Jack Welch, its legendary CEO, could do no wrong.Stocks were hot, and GE was among the hottest. Investors bid up GE's multiple to an absurd 55 times trailing earnings. Everything looks more obvious with the benefit of hindsight, but the idea that one of the world's largest companies could continue to grow its earnings at such a rapid pace appears downright absurd today.A change in management, and the financial crisisGE has grown both its revenue and its earnings over the last 15 years, but at an average annual rate of a little more than 1%. Unsurprisingly, GE's multiple has contracted sharply, down to a much more reasonable 18 times trailing earnings.GE's business has also undergone a number of fundamental shifts and faced fearsome challenges. Welch retired and was replaced by Jeff Immelt. The crisis of 2008 forced the company to temporarily slash its dividend by 68%, and fears of mounting losses at its GE Capital unit cost the company its prized AAA credit rating in 2009.The largest S&P 500 component has never been a solid betApple is a much different company than GE. GE is often thought of for its jet engines, appliances, and light bulbs, but the GE of the last 15 years was involved in all manner of businesses, including the entertainment industry through its subsidiary NBCUniversal.Apple, in contrast, sells only a handful of products, and it derives the overwhelming majority of its revenue from a single gadget: the iPhone. It has no massive finance arm -- it's not involved in making mortgages or TV shows.But GE does provide at least somewhat of a cautionary tale in the sense that, historically, the largest member of the S&P 500 has almost always proven to be a bad bet. Not just GE, but other titans, including IBM and ExxonMobil, severely underperformed the index in the years immediately following their ascent. Last month, bond investor Jeff Gundlach (via Business Insider) observed that, since 1972, the S&P 500's largest member has always underperformed the rest of the index.That's more of a technical argument than a fundamental one, but there may be an astute observation there: Past a certain point, it becomes difficult for large companies to grow.Apple could be the first company to defy that trend, but it's something investors should be aware of.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Don't Panic Over International Business Machines Corp.'s Earnings,"Jan 22, 2015 at 9:35PM","Shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) slumped after the company reported its fourth-quarter earnings, with declining revenue and weak guidance spooking the market. On the surface, the 12% year-over-year revenue decline appears downright awful, but IBM sold off three major businesses in 2014, and adjusting for those divestitures improves the picture significantly. There's an awful lot of pessimism surrounding the company and the stock right now, but IBM is in a much stronger position than the recent stock performance suggests.A look at the resultsWhile the headline revenue decline may seem like a good reason for investors to panic, the situation at IBM is a lot better than it seems. Here's how IBM's various segments performed during the fourth quarter, including both the reported revenue growth and the revenue growth adjusted for the major divestitures IBM made throughout the year:SegmentRevenue (Billions)Growth (Reported)Growth (Adjusted)Global Technology Services$9.2(8%)2%Global Business Services$4.3(8%)(3%)Software$7.6(7%)(3%)Systems and Technology$2.4(39%)(12%)Global Financing$0.50%5%Total$24.1(12%)(2%)SOURCE: IBM. After backing out IBM's sale of its x86 server business, its semiconductor manufacturing business, and its customer care outsourcing business, revenue declined by just 2%. Global Technology Services, the largest segment, actually posted growth, and the only truly large decline was in the Systems and Technology segment. However, with a refresh of IBM's mainframes recently announced, this decline was partly due to customers who held off on mainframe upgrades until the new system is available.While revenue declined, margins rose. Gross margin jumped by 0.9 percentage points, helped by the sale of the commodity x86 server business, and operating margin jumped to 29.4%, up from 25.9% during the fourth quarter of 2013. Billions in buybacks throughout the year counteracted a higher tax rate, with EPS down just 4% year over year.IBM expects GAAP EPS to be between $14.35 and $15.10 for 2015, with non-GAAP EPS between $15.75 and $16.50. That range is well below the $20 target IBM was recently forced to abandon, and it points to another tough year for the company. However, the progress IBM made during 2014 provides a foundation for future growth, and while this year will a difficult one, there's really nothing wrong with IBM's business that can't be fixed.Stronger than it appearsIBM provided a useful slide in its earnings presentation that sums up the business:SOURCE: IBM.The bulk of IBM's revenue is recurring, with long contracts ensuring a stable source of future revenue. Any weakness should be visible well in advance, particularly in the services business, in the form of a declining backlog or reduced signings. During the fourth quarter, adjusted for the divested business, IBM's services backlog was flat at $128 billion. The company also signed $18.4 billion of new business, a 13% jump year over year. No problems there.Future growth for IBM will come from the businesses that it calls Strategic Imperatives. This segment includes anything related to the cloud, business analytics, mobile, and security, and it tends to be heavily weighted toward software, the highest-margin portion of IBM's business. During 2014, cloud revenue grew by 60% to $7 billion. Business analytics grew 7% to $17 billion, mobile revenue tripled, and security grew by 19%. Overall, IBM's strategic imperatives grew by 16% in 2014, and they now make up about 27% of IBM's total revenue.These businesses include SoftLayer, IBM's infrastructure-as-a-service offering, BlueMix, its platform-as-a-service running on top of SoftLayer, and a slew of analytics software, including Watson, which can be delivered as a cloud service. IBM's annual run rate of software-as-a-service delivered through the cloud has now reached $3.5 billion. Despite IBM's late entry into the cloud business, it seems to be doing a pretty good job catching up.Now, declining earnings are never a good thing, and 2015 certainly isn't going to be a bumper year for IBM. But any company that's been around for a century inevitably goes through rough patches. Expecting unrelenting earnings growth, year in and year out, is unrealistic. At the same time, an earnings decline isn't the end of the world. IBM's operating income declined in the early 2000s, a decade after a huge collapse in the 1990s nearly killed the company. But IBM, on each occasion, adjusted its strategy, moving toward higher-value, higher-margin businesses. That strategy has paid off.IBM OPERATING INCOME (ANNUAL) DATA BY YCHARTSThe challenges that IBM faces today appear no different. The company is in much better shape compared with the 1990s, when the low-end mainframe market was overtaken by the PC and server. Today, hardware is only a small part of IBM's business, even smaller now that the x86 server business is gone. IBM is a top-three software vendor, and its global services business appears to be stable.The sky isn't falling. IBM's business is not collapsing. There's no reason to panic."
Better Bad News Buy: IBM or Microsoft Corporation?,"Jan 30, 2015 at 10:10AM","Shares of IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have both seen better days. IBM has slumped 14.3% over the past 12 months. Microsoft stock fared better with a 13.6% gain, but slid 9% after its mixed second-quarter earnings report.SOURCE: YCHARTS.Both tech titans are transitioning their older business models toward the cloud, and both have been posting declines in their core businesses. However, contrarian investors should take a second look at these two ""bad news"" stocks to see if either is worth buying as others sell.Top-line comparisonLast quarter, IBM's revenue fell 12% year over year to $24.1 billion, dropping across all business segments. Software revenue declined 7% to $7.6 billion. global technology services revenue fell 8% to $9.2 billion, global business services slid 8% to $4.3 billion, and system and technology revenue plunged 39% to $2.4 billion.IBM attributed those declines to weak client spending, sluggish demand in the software sector, and the divestitures of several lower-margin businesses, including its x86 server, microelectronics, and customer care divisions. Those divestitures were intended to improve the company's earnings per share, but they also took a bite out of its top line.By comparison, Microsoft's revenue rose 9% year over year to $26.5 billion last quarter. Device and consumer revenue rose 8% to $12.9 billion, while commercial revenue grew 5% to $13.3 billion. However, Windows Pro and non-Pro revenue both fell 13%, prompting fears that Microsoft was slowly killing its cash cow with free and cheap licenses for OEMs. Nonetheless, Surface, Windows Phones, and Xbox sales remained solid, while the number of Office 365 personal and home subscribers rose 30% sequentially to 9.2 million.This disparity between these two companies' revenue growth isn't new. Over the past five years, IBM's revenue has steadily slipped as Microsoft posted double-digit gains.SOURCE: YCHARTS.Bottom-line battleIn 2007, then-IBM CEO Sam Palmisano promised to double the company's EPS to $20 by 2015. But to fulfill that lofty promise, IBM divested its lower-margin businesses and financed share buybacks with debt. Over the past 12 months, IBM had free cash flow of $13 billion, but repurchased $18.55 billion in stock.That strategy resulted in lower revenue growth and the artificial inflation of earnings per share. Even with that support, IBM's diluted EPS from continuing operations fell 4% year over year last quarter, as net income fell 11% to $5.5 billion, due to top-line declines in its remaining businesses. On the bright side, CEO Ginni Rometty replaced Palmisano's $20 promise with more realistic EPS guidance of $15.75 to $16.50 for 2015, which would represent just 1% to 6% growth from 2014.Microsoft's bottom line has been under pressure from restructuring charges related to integrating Nokia's (NYSE:NOK) handset division and the discounts on Windows licenses. Last quarter, its diluted EPS fell 9% to $0.71 per share as net income fell 10.6% to $5.86 billion. Looking ahead, Microsoft's earnings growth will likely remain lumpy as it keeps some Windows licenses free, gives away Windows 10 as a free upgrade, and offers more free trials for Office 365. Wall Street expects Microsoft to finish fiscal 2015 with earnings of $2.44 per share -- a 7% decline from 2014.The cloud awaitsIBM and Microsoft are both transitioning toward higher-margin cloud-based businesses. IBM is doing this via inorganic growth through acquisitions, while Microsoft is mostly upgrading its existing products and services.For the full year, IBM's total revenue from cloud-based revenue rose 60% year over year to $7 billion. Within that total, cloud delivered as a service revenue rose 75% to $3 billion, with a year-end annual run rate of $3.5 billion. While $3.5 billion is admittedly a small percentage of IBM's 2014 revenue of $92.8 billion, the company recently inked major cloud deals across multiple sectors that could eventually offset its drastic declines in software.Last quarter, Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue -- which comes from Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM -- rose 114% year over year, and it is now on track to hit an annual run rate of $5.5 billion. That would also represent a small percentage of Microsoft's expected revenue of $98 billion for fiscal 2015, but it could eventually offset short-term declines in Windows revenue.The verdictHere are the three key takeaways from comparing IBM to Microsoft: Microsoft tops IBM in revenue growth, both companies are struggling with bottom-line growth, and both are pivoting their businesses toward higher-margin cloud services.Despite these similarities, I would buy Microsoft before IBM, since its plans to consolidate the PC market with Windows 10, spread that influence to mobile devices, then tie it all together with universal apps offers more long-term promise than IBM's ongoing problems in the middleware market.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Warren Buffett Keeps Buying IBM Stock: Should You Follow Him?,"Mar 3, 2015 at 5:10PM","SOURCE: IBMWarren Buffett took a big position in IBM (NYSE:IBM) back in 2011, and he bought more IBM stock at lower prices during the fourth quarter in 2014. The Oracle of Omaha is arguably the best investor ever alive, and he seems to be quite convinced about his investment in IBM, so maybe the stock deserves some serious consideration. Should you follow Warren Buffett into IBM stock?A high conviction pickIBM is among Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) ""big four"" investments, an honor it shares with classic Warren Buffett stocks such as Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo, and American Express. Berkshire increased its ownership in each of its big four positions last year, however, Warren Buffett only allocated fresh capital to IBM, the ownership increase in Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo, and American Express was solely due to share repurchases from these companies. Berkshire Hathaway owns 76.9 million IBM shares as of the end of the fourth quarter, for a market value of more than $12.3 billion and a company ownership of 7.8%. Warren Buffett does not make investment decisions lightly, IBM is a big position for Berkshire, and Buffett is buying more IBM stock at current prices, so he must have strong reasons to do so.This is a particularly interesting case, since IBM stock has delivered dismal returns over the last three years, declining by 18.8% versus a big increase of 54.4% for the S&P 500 Index over the same period.No surprisesOne of the main reasons for the decline in IBM stock price is that revenues are falling, which is something that is spooking investors and Wall Street analysts away. The company is divesting its low margin businesses in order to better focus on its most profitable divisions with superior strategic value, and currency fluctuations are also a considerable drag on performance.In this context, IBM reported a 6% decline in revenue from continuing operations during 2014. When adjusting for divested businesses and currency fluctuations, the decline was a much more moderate 1%, but sales are still moving in the wrong direction. Non-GAAP operating earnings per share fell 1% during the year.In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Buffett said that there have been no surprises regarding IBM and its stagnant revenues over the last few years. Transformations take time to produce results, and the Oracle of Omaha is all about patience and investing for the long term.In fact, Buffett said in the interview that he is feeling quite happy with the decline in IBM's stock price, as this allows the company to repurchase more stock at convenient prices. This is not an excuse the Oracle of Omaha is making because of the disappointing returns Berkshire is getting from IBM. In his 2011 letter to Berkshire investors, Warren Buffett wrote:Today, IBM has 1.16 billion shares outstanding, of which we own about 63.9 million or 5.5%. Naturally, what happens to the company's earnings over the next five years is of enormous importance to us. Beyond that, the company will likely spend $50 billion or so in those years to repurchase shares. Our quiz for the day: What should a long-term shareholder, such as Berkshire, cheer for during that period?I won't keep you in suspense. We should wish for IBM's stock price to languish throughout the five years.The logic is simple: If you are going to be a net buyer of stocks in the future, either directly with your own money or indirectly (through your ownership of a company that is repurchasing shares), you are hurt when stocks rise. You benefit when stocks swoon. Emotions, however, too often complicate the matter: Most people, including those who will be net buyers in the future, take comfort in seeing stock prices advance. These shareholders resemble a commuter who rejoices after the price of gas increases, simply because his tank contains a day's supply.The bullish case for IBMShare buybacks are one of the main reasons why Buffett is invested in IBM, and what the company is achieving in that department is nothing short of amazing. IBM has reduced its average diluted share count by more than 40% in the last decade; in addition, IBM has raised dividends per share by 450% through that period.IBM AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING (QUARTERLY) DATA BY YCHARTSWhile overall revenues remain stagnant, sales from the segments that management has identified as ""strategic imperatives"" -- meaning cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security technologies -- are doing remarkably well. Sales in these divisions grew 16% in 2014, and that was in spite of strong currency headwinds. Together, these businesses account for 27% of total revenues, since they will most likely continue outgrowing the rest of the company in the coming years, their contribution to overall growth rates should continue increasing over time.Valuation is also compelling, IBM trades at a forward P/E ratio of 9.6, nearly half the average valuation for companies in the S&P 500 Index. If the company's transformation generates accelerating growth in the coming years, then IBM stock offers considerable upside potential from current levels.Investors should never blindly follow the decisions of others, not even when it comes to an investing superstar like Warren Buffett. However, considering IBM's massive capital distributions, opportunities to accelerate growth in the future, and attractive valuation, there are solid reasons to give IBM some serious consideration.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks to Watch in Servers,"May 28, 2015 at 12:06PM","The $50 billion global server market is in a state of transition. Big cloud computing companies are increasingly turning to both white box systems from original design manufacturers and custom-built systems, cutting out the major server vendors altogether. In 2014, the global server market grew by just 2.3%, but revenue from original design manufacturers grew by 40%, and revenue from vendors outside of the top five grew by 26.3%.With all of the changes occurring in this industry, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY), and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) are three server stocks investors should keep an eye on.International Business MachinesIBM server revenue plummeted during 2014, declining nearly 27%, thanks largely to the sale of its x86 server business to Lenovo. IBM is now left with only Power systems and mainframes, leaving it to compete mainly in the high-end segment.The mainframe business remains strong, and a recent refresh of its mainframe product line lifted sales by over 100% during the most recent quarter. IBM completely dominates the market for mainframes, and while this represents a small part of the total server market, the mainframe business has proven to be incredibly resilient over the years.IBM Power servers, on the other hand, have been losing the battle against servers built with Intel x86 chips -- Big Blue is now fighting back. The company is part of the OpenPOWER foundation, which seeks to build an ecosystem around the Power architecture by opening it up to partners. While Power servers could only be purchased directly from IBM in the past, the company is now allowing third parties to manufacture Power-based systems.Companies like Google and NVIDIA, along with over 100 others, are on board, and the first non-IBM Power servers are expected to launch sometime this year in China. This has the potential to disrupt the market if these Power servers are priced competitively compared to Intel-based systems.LenovoLenovo bought the IBM PC business in 2004, and over the past decade, the company has grown into the largest PC vendor in the world. It is now looking to do the same in the server industry, snapping up IBM's x86 server business last year.Lenovo server sales put it well out of the top five in 2013, but in the fourth quarter of 2014, including the effects of the acquisition, Lenovo rose to the No. 4 spot, recording $1.1 billion in sales. The company knocked Oracle completely off the list, with its market share reaching 7.6%.Lenovo has big plans for its enterprise segment. The company expects to generate $5 billion in annual enterprise sales within one year after closing the IBM deal, and it expects to boost profitability as well. With margins in the PC business extremely low, a higher-margin enterprise business could do wonders for Lenovo's bottom line.The company is facing some challenges, however. Lenovo inherited former IBM x86 customers in the deal, and some of them are not happy that their server vendor is now based in China. The U.S. Navy, which uses IBM servers in the Aegis Combat System, is working with the system vendor, Lockheed Martin, to replace the servers due to security concerns.Despite these issues, with China being a major server market, Lenovo has the opportunity to continue to grow its enterprise business going forward, potentially stealing away market share from market leaders HP and Dell. If its rise in the PC market is any indication, Lenovo knows how to disrupt the status quo.CiscoCisco, known for its networking switches and routers, came out of nowhere a few years ago with its Unified Computing System, or UCS, servers. Cisco UCS servers include both computing hardware and networking hardware and software, providing an integrated solution meant to lower the total cost of ownership for its clients.In the fourth quarter of 2014, Cisco managed to take the No. 5 spot in the global market, selling about $770 million worth of servers. As of the most recent quarter, Cisco UCS servers have reached a $3 billion annual run rate, with 85% of Fortune 500 companies counted as customers.Cisco now leads the x86 blade server market in the United States, and it is second worldwide, an impressive accomplishment given that UCS was first launched in 2009. Cisco server revenue is growing far faster than the market as a whole, up 19.1% year-over-year during the fourth quarter of 2014, according to IDC, and up 21% year-over-year during its most recently reported quarter.It is difficult to say how much market share Cisco will ultimately be able to win, but its success in the server market shows that even big, lumbering companies can disrupt markets.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Best Stocks to Invest in Cloud Computing,"Apr 8, 2015 at 12:27PM","While forecasts vary, virtually all suggest that both companies and consumers are in the midst of a substantial shift to cloud computing. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) alone is expected to become a $106 billion industry by 2016, a 21% jump from forecasts for this year. Security, business intelligence (BI), and data storage in the cloud are also growing at phenomenal rates.For investors, the question is how to best take advantage of this huge industry, particularly when it seems nearly every tech company on the planet claims to be the cloud provider of choice. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are all on pace to differentiate themselves from the pack. As an added bonus, the three industry behemoths also share another common trait: an industry-leading dividend yield.Hitting the markEven as cloud technologies and services remain in their early stages, it has become abundantly clear that revenue -- at least significant revenue -- is not going to come from hosting. Many of the big-time cloud providers have essentially made cloud data hosting a commodity, which is ideal for Microsoft. SaaS solutions will be a major source of growth, and there are few tech companies around that can match Microsoft's suite of products.Though many analysts and investors focused on Microsoft's 13% drop in Windows OEM Pro and non-Pro revenues last quarter -- which explains its rather dismal stock performance year-to-date -- CEO Satya Nadella and team are delivering where it counts: his ""cloud-first"" mantra. Cloud revenues jumped a whopping 114% from the year-ago period, an impressive sixth straight quarter where the company enjoyed a triple-digit increase in cloud revenue.At an annual run-rate of $5.5 billion in sales, if Microsoft is not at the top of the cloud heap, it is awfully close. And with its history of triple-digit growth rates, investors can expect more of the same when the company announces third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings later this month.All things to all peopleAs the world becomes more ""plugged in,"" entire industries are beginning to recognize the value of utilizing the data generated by consumers via mobile, PC devices, and Internet of Things-related (IoT) technologies. Amassing and storing the data via the cloud is one thing, but actually analyzing it and generating actionable results is a whole different ballgame. And that is where IBM enters the picture.What differentiates IBM from its cloud competitors is its wide-ranging capabilities as it relates to data. From a $1 billion investment last year in its Watson super-computer unit to its recently announced $3 billion commitment to driving growth in the Internet of Things, IBM is positioning itself as a leading cloud-based, big data, and IoT leader, and it is working.Last quarter, IBM generated $7 billion in total cloud sales, a 60% jump from the year prior. Now, some of that came from existing sales that were migrated to its cloud unit, but its $3.5 billion annual run rate of SaaS cloud revenues is nothing to sneeze at. With its recent investments and the incorporation of the IoT and big data all delivered via the cloud, IBM is a force to be reckoned with.The nuts and bolts of the cloudSimilar to both Microsoft and IBM, despite record fourth quarter and full-year 2014 earnings, Intel shareholders have not enjoyed a great 2015. Down over 14% year-to-date, investors cannot seem to get past the stagnant PC market -- the primary source of Intel revenue. And there is something to be said for the PC-related negativity -- over 60% of revenue in the most recent quarter came from the PC unit.But when cloud-related revenues are taken into account, Intel starts to look like the value stock it is. As with IBM, Intel recognizes that analyzing the unprecedented amounts of data the cloud will amass offers huge potential. Why? Because cloud providers require data centers and the ability to process all that information, and a look at last quarter indicates that CEO Brian Krzanich's pledge ""to lead Intel into the next era"" is right on track.Not only did the Intel data center unit boast a 25% year-over-year revenue increase, the $4.1 billion in sales made up a larger portion of its total revenue. In other words, cloud-related data center revenue is becoming a key driver of growth at the company, right in line with Krzanich's strategic objectives. Just as with Microsoft and IBM, Intel offers shareholders about a 3% dividend yield.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Can The Internet of Things Help Save Warren Buffett's Favorite Tech Stock?,"Apr 5, 2015 at 11:45AM","Despite the ongoing confidence of Warren Buffett -- arguably the greatest investor of all time -- things haven't been exactly coming up roses at information-technology behemoth IBM (NYSE:IBM) lately.IBM DATA BY YCHARTS.After leveraging some seriously savvy financial engineering for years, IBM's slow adaptation to our cloud-based future has cost Big Blue. However, IBM recently unveiled some rather ambitious goals as part of its ongoing business model evolution.Can this elephant still dance?IBM has made it no secret it intends to bet big on many of the largest growth spaces in tech today -- buzzword-laden areas including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things. Providing some more specificity, IBM recently announced plans to invest $3 billion over the next four years to expand its Internet of Things offerings.That's all perfectly understandable. However, as CEO Ginni Rometty said at the company's investor day in late February, IBM hopes to scale its investments in IoT, data analytics, cloud computing, and other areas of strategic focus into a collective $40 billion in revenue by 2018. SOURCE: SOURCE: IBMFor context, this targeted $40 billion could represent roughly 45% of IBM's projected sales in 2018, based on analyst estimates compiled by Reuters.  FY 2014Projected FY 2018% ChangeNew Growth Initiative Sales ($Bil)$25 $4060%As a % of Sales27%45%-Total Sales ($Bil)$92.79 $88.89-4.2%SOURCE: IBM INVESTOR RELATIONS.Now, that's by no means impossible. IBM employs roughly 400,000 employees and generated about $93 billion in sales in its fiscal 2014. It has some of the deepest engineering talent out there and the financial clout to acquire its way into new markets. However, for a company of that size and scope, reorienting or overhauling roughly half the organization in a relatively short time frame does strike me as a tall order.Color me skepticalWhat's particularly concerning is what these projections say about the state of IBM's revenue base. The need for such a drastic overhaul certainly begs the question of whether its sales base is at even greater risk of contraction than many suspect.IBM reported a $128 billion service contract backlog at the end of last year, and clients are not likely able to migrate away from the company's software platforms en masse in short order. However, seeing how much IBM expects to yield from its current generation of investments in emerging technologies and that even these lofty future gains still won't drive much (if any) revenue growth, Big Blue's future course could prove more precarious than it would have you think.SOURCE: IBM. Looking at IBM's projected long-term financial model, it appears nearly identical to management's strategy for driving returns for the better part of the last decade: growing revenue in the low single-digits, continually optimizing its product mix to bolster bottom-line margin expansion, and returning the bulk of its proceeds to shareholders via dividends and buybacks.However, with clear challenges to IBM's sales base clouding at least its near-term prospects, the ease of achieving these goals does not seem as clear-cut as in the past.Viewed in their entirety, this series of projections paints IBM's future course in far less certain terms than we're used to for a company as renowned for its stability as IBM. Big Blue has defied the odds before and executed significant strategic shifts, but these numbers certainly paint an unpleasant picture. So with IBM having to achieve quite a bit in the years to come, here's to hoping this elephant can still dance.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2 Big Data Companies to Invest in Now,"Apr 18, 2015 at 2:00PM","Marketing departments and business leaders have long understood the value of collecting and analyzing data to help drive ad campaigns and make strategic business decisions. Generally, information was housed internally on a company's database, and creative folks would slice and dice it to determine consumers' behavior patterns and business trends.But with the advent of the Internet of Things, or IoT, an exploding mobile market, and an all-time high capacity to track consumers' behaviors, the internal database simply won't do. There is too much data to assimilate, and most companies are not equipped to maximize their data's value using supercomputers capable of predictive analysis, or ""machine learning."" Enter Big Data and big opportunities for early adopter IBM (NYSE:IBM) and fellow tech behemoth Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).How big is Big Data?According to IDC, Big Data and the analytical tools used to generate actionable results will become a $125 billion industry this year. As impressive an opportunity as that represents for IBM, Microsoft and other players in the business, expected growth of the market in the coming years is even more staggering.Over the next five years, per IDC, off-premise cloud-based spending will grow three times faster than traditional in-house expenditures, and a fair portion of that will be for predictive analytics tools; there's simply too much information to use ""old"" technologies. In fact, 2015 is expected to be a blowout year for machine-learning tools in association with Big Data, growing nearly two-thirds faster than the market for nonpredictive solutions.Signs of lifeIt has become apparent that the providers that will eventually dominate the Big Data space are those that offer a bevy of solutions rather than a piecemeal approach. That requires not only the capacity to store reams of data, but to do so in the cloud using predictive analytics. As IBM demonstrated in 2014, CEO Ginni Rometty and team are delivering on her strategic imperatives, namely cloud -- and by extension Big Data and analytic -- sales results. IBM CEO GINNI ROMETTY. PHOTO: IBMBig Blue's cloud service revenue jumped 75% last year, and IBM is now tracking for $3.5 billion in annual revenue. Customers are looking to IBM for cloud solutions. As its recent deal with the U.S. Army indicates, IBM is recognized as a leader in Big Data. The Army's logistics systems generate over 40 million transactions a day and are now powered by IBM's Hybrid Cloud. Given the company's leading analytic capabilities, the U.S. Army won't be the last Big Data customers to partner with IBM.A leader and a followerMicrosoft's virtual assistant Cortana, while a simpler example than IBM's machine-learning Watson supercomputer, is capable of analyzing data and predicting future needs. CEO Satya Nadella is using Cortana as the basis for enhancing Microsoft's predictive analytics services. Considering the relatively quick transition Nadella, and to some extent former CEO Steve Ballmer before him, is making into budding industries such as mobile and Big Data, it likely won't be long before Microsoft has a Watson of its own.Microsoft's success in the cloud and related software-as-a-service sales is already undeniable. Last quarter marked the sixth straight period of triple-digit growth in cloud sales, and Microsoft is now tracking at a remarkable $5.5 billion in annual revenue. Microsoft's Azure cloud platform is also leading the charge into Big Data. One advantage Microsoft has over other players is the familiarity of businesses and consumers with services such as Excel, which is integrated into its cloud-based Big Data suite.For the same reason, developers are likely to find Microsoft Big Data solutions easy to work with, in that its now-open source .NET language can be used for programming, along with several alternatives. Microsoft leads in the cloud, and IBM is ahead in predictive analytics, but both are moving fast to shore up their relative shortcomings to get a jump-start on this exploding industry. Now toss in the value both represent compared to their peers, along with a nearly 3% dividend, and there's much to like about the Big Data futures of Microsoft and IBM."
1 Tech Company With More Patent Prowess Than Apple Inc. or Samsung Electronics,"Jan 15, 2015 at 9:30AM","Apple and Samsung always win the patent headlines because the two tech giants unceasingly tango over who owns what mobile technology. Despite all the public drama, it's actually IBM (NYSE:IBM) that dominates the U.S. patent office.According to IFI Claims Patents Services, IBM was awarded 7,534 patents in 2014 -- the only company to ever receive more than 7,000 patents in a single year -- taking the top spot for the 22nd consecutive year. Meanwhile Samsung took the No. 2 spot, and Apple came in at No. 11.IBM's patent trove has been built in part from its research and development spending, which is approaching highs the company hasn't seen since the early 1990s.R&D SPENDING IS CLOSING IN ON MID 1990S HIGHS. SOURCE: YCHARTS.But while all the R&D spending certainly helps in gaining new patents, it doesn't bring in a whole lot in yearly revenue. The company is estimated to bring in about $1 billion in annual patent royalties, compared to its nearly $100 billion in total revenue.Meanwhile Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which came in at No. 5 with patent awards in 2014, earns nearly $2 billion every year just on its mobile patents used in Android devices. ZDNet notes that Microsoft may earn anywhere between $10 and $32 for every Samsung Galaxy S5 sold, and $5 to $16 for other Android phones. For compairson's sake, Microsoft spent more than $11.3 billion in research and development last year compared to IBM's $6.2 billion.Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) consistenly brings in some serious revenue from its patent licensing -- more than $30.5 billion over the past five years. The company owns a treasure trove of 3G and 4G patent technology that mobile companies need to connect their mobile devices to the Internet. What's interesting is that Qualcomm has spent less on R&D every year for the past 10 years than IBM has, yet it makes much more from its patents.That should be something IBM considers in light of the company's falling revenue.THIS ISN'T MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SOURCE: YCHARTS .Since 2012, the company's sales have been on a steep decline, partially because companies have moved more toward cloud computing solutions while IBM has been left trying to catch up. CEO Ginni Rometty recently updated the company's business organization and management to make IBM more competitive and focus more on security, analytics, and commerce. But it could take a while for the reorganization to bring any significant changes at the company. SOURCE: IBM.Meanwhile, the Financial Times is reporting (paywall) that IBM is looking to its latest mainframe computer to breath new financial life into the company. Hardware makes up just 11% of IBM's business right now, but FT says that between a quarter and a third of the company's profits stem from mainframes because of the additional software and services sold with them. That should help bring up revenue in the short term, but IBM's long-term plans need more than a harkening back to old revenue streams. Which brings us back to IBM's patent trove. While the company is busy restructuring and looking for new areas of growth, hopefully IBM will take a page out Qualcomm's notebook and develop patents it can make significant revenue from over the long-term. If not, it would appear that earning the most patents year after year isn't really worth all that much. "

"No, IBM Is Not Falling Apart","Nov 10, 2015 at 7:26AM","On the surface, it looks like International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is falling apart. Including its third-quarter results last month, the company has now reported revenue declines for 14 quarters in a row. Revenue slumped 14% year over year during the third quarter, and the company slashed its earnings guidance for the full year. IBM now expects its non-GAAP earnings to be $15.75 per share at most during 2015, well below its long-touted goal of $20 per share that was dropped last year.What's worse, IBM's revenue declines are accelerating. Here's how IBM's revenue has evolved over the past few years:DATA FROM IBM QUARTERLY EARNINGS REPORTS.The red bars in the above graph represent IBM's reported revenue, while the green bars exclude the effects of both currency exchange rates and divestitures. On a reported basis, things started to get really bad toward the end of 2014, when revenue began to plunge by a double-digit percentage each quarter. The situation has gotten worse each quarter, with the third quarter of this year seeing the largest drop in revenue so far.The green bars tell a very different story. IBM has sold off a handful of businesses over the past few years, and the green bars exclude the impact of these divestitures. Last year, IBM sold its x86 server business to Lenovo, leaving the company's hardware segment with mainframes and Power servers, both of which use processors of IBM's design. IBM also got rid of its semiconductor manufacturing business, paying GlobalFoundries $1.5 billion to take the struggling unit off its hands. IBM continues to invest in semiconductor research, and the company now outsources the actual manufacture of semiconductors to GlobalFoundries.The green bars also exclude the effects of currency. Over the past year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened, meaning that revenue earned in other countries translates into fewer U.S. dollars. IBM is a global business, and currency has had a major negative effect on its reported revenue. Here, for example, is how the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate has evolved over the past five years:EURO TO U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE DATA BY YCHARTS.Toward the end of 2014, a sharp drop in the exchange rate led to big year-over-year declines. This is the main reason IBM's revenue began to tank beginning in the third quarter of 2014. On an adjusted basis, IBM's revenue situation has actually improved so far this year compared to 2013 and 2014, with smaller year-over-year declines. During the third quarter of this year, revenue from the Europe/Middle East/Africa region, adjusted for currency and divestitures, actually grew by 1%.The red bars appear to show a company that is unraveling at the seams, but the green bars represent a more accurate picture of how IBM is actually performing. Currency remains an issue, and as the above exchange rate chart shows, revenue over the next few quarters will continue to be negatively affected by exchange rates. But currency is not something IBM can control, and these large revenue declines -- and the associated profit declines -- have almost nothing to do with the performance of IBM's business.IBM's revenue is still declining on an adjusted basis, but the company is going through a transformation, exiting unattractive businesses and investing in growth areas like analytics and cloud. The company's strategy involves moving to higher-value businesses, focusing on the areas of IT that promise superior returns on investment.During the New York Times DealBook Conference earlier this month, IBM CEO Virginia Rometty summed up IBM's strategy:What's important is that we grow in the right areas. Tech is littered with areas that you can have high growth and make no money. That's not us.In the long run, temporary currency fluctuations don't matter. IBM's headline numbers appear dire, but they don't represent how the business is truly performing. IBM is not falling apart, and long-term investors shouldn't panic.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Warren Buffett Loves IBM's Declining Stock Price,"Aug 20, 2015 at 9:40AM","When Warren Buffett speaks, the entire investing world listens. There is good reason for this, as the Oracle of Omaha has proven himself to be one of history's greatest investors, having built Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) into a massive conglomerate with a roughly $350 billion market capitalization.In a recent interview, Buffett offered some interesting thoughts on several of his top investments. I was particularly intrigued by Buffett's comments on his investment in International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). IBM stock has performed very poorly in the past few years.IBM 3 YEAR STOCK PERFORMANCE, DATA BY YCHARTSSurprisingly, Buffett said he loves IBM's declining stock price. If that sounds crazy, investors should know that there's a method to his madness.IBM leaves a markAs of June 30, Berkshire Hathaway held slightly more than 79 million shares of IBM. That represents approximately 8% of IBM's shares outstanding, which amounts to a $12.3 billion investment today.This makes Berkshire Hathaway IBM's biggest shareholder. As a result, Buffett has a lot at stake in the technology giant. Buffett recently said that his cost basis is around $170 per share. IBM currently trades for about $154 per share, meaning that Berkshire's position is down roughly 9%.That might not seem like much, but considering how many shares Berkshire owns, the position is suffering a paper loss of roughly $1.3 billion. That's a whole lot of money, but Buffett's not sweating it at all. Rather, in the same interview, he said, ""I love it when a stock goes down."" Although that sounds counterintuitive, here's why Buffett's sentiment is right on the money.Don't count out IBM's turnaroundIBM's stock price is down because its revenue has been stuck in a prolonged decline. In fact, IBM's revenue has fallen for the past 13 quarters in a row. That is an infamous track record that makes IBM a scary proposition as an investment. Thus far, the company has suffered from an inability to expand quickly enough into higher-growth areas like Big Data, security, and the cloud, and it has been dragged down by less-profitable hardware businesses like semiconductor manufacturing.But all of this is changing, albeit extremely slowly. IBM categorizes its newer growth ventures as its ""strategic imperatives,"" which collectively grew revenue by 30% in the first half of the year, adjusting for currency and divestments. These businesses represented 27% of IBM's total revenue last year, compared to just 13% back in 2010.The takeaway here is that IBM's turnaround remains intact, but it's taking a lot longer than many investors would like. However, in the meantime, IBM is still doing some good things for shareholders.The beauty of buybacksAs IBM's stock price has declined in the past few years, its valuation multiples have contracted significantly. IBM now trades for 13 times trailing earnings and less than 10 times forward EPS estimates.Importantly, IBM's stock decline has been the result of multiple contraction more than deteriorating EPS. This is an important distinction that explains why Buffett isn't worried about IBM's stock price. There is a vast difference between a stock price going down because investors aren't willing to pay a higher multiple, versus a stock price declining because of severe earnings deterioration.The truth is, IBM's earnings have risen over the past five years, which puts its stock price decline into a different perspective. IBM shares are down 22% in the past three years, but IBM's earnings per share grew 8% from 2012-2014. That's largely the result of IBM's aggressive share buyback program.IBM AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING (ANNUAL), DATA BY YCHARTS.For all of its top-line struggles, IBM still generates a lot of cash. That's a testament to its strong business. It returns a great deal of this cash to investors through its share buybacks and dividends. From 2000-2013, IBM spent $108 billion on net share repurchases.

What to Expect When International Business Machines Corp. Reports Earnings,"Oct 19, 2015 at 8:00AM","SOURCE: IBMInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is set to report its third quarter results after market close on Monday, Oct. 19. The company has been suffering from big revenue declines over the past few years, mostly driven by selling off underperforming businesses and foreign exchange headwinds, and that trend is unlikely to change during the third quarter.IBM's second quarter was mixed, with the company beating analyst estimates for earnings while coming up short on revenue. Its strategic imperatives, which are businesses where most of IBM's future growth is expected to come from, have grown quickly during the first half of the year, with revenue increasing by 30% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Other parts of the company haven't performed as well, and the result has been lower revenue and profits.What analysts are expectingAnalysts are expecting both revenue and profits to decline for IBM during the quarter. The average analyst estimate for revenue is $19.61 billion, down 12.5% compared to the same quarter last year. During the second quarter, IBM revenue declined by 13% year-over-year. Neither of these numbers are adjusted for currency or divestitures -- on an adjusted basis, IBM revenue was down just 1% during the second quarter.Analysts expect IBM to report non-GAAP earnings per share, what IBM calls operating EPS, of $3.30, down about 10% year-over-year. Operating EPS excludes both acquisition-related and retirement-related items but does not exclude stock-based compensation, a rarity among tech companies. For this reason, operating EPS is a better indication of IBM's earnings power than GAAP EPS.While IBM hasn't provided guidance for the third quarter, it does expect full-year operating EPS to be between $15.75 and $16.50. Analysts on average expect just $15.70 of operating EPS for the full year. IBM reaffirmed this guidance when it reported its second quarter results.What investors should look forIBM's numbers are still being skewed by currency and divestitures, so the headline revenue decline isn't as bad as it seems. However, the company is not growing, even adjusted for these items, which means the strategic imperatives have yet to reach critical mass.Investors should look for continued growth in these areas, which include cloud, analytics, mobile, and social, during the third quarter. Cloud revenue jumped by 70% year-over-year last quarter on an adjusted basis, with $8.7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months. This includes hardware, software, and services, so it may not be directly comparable to cloud revenue from other cloud companies. The portion of IBM's cloud revenue that's delivered as a service reached an annual run rate of $4.5 billion during the second quarter, up from $2.8 billion during the year-ago period.Meanwhile, revenue from business analytics most recently rose by 20% on an adjusted basis, with mobile revenue quadrupling and social revenue rising by 40%. Strategic imperatives accounted for $25 billion of the top line in 2014, so double-digit growth is adding a meaningful amount of revenue to IBM's total.Beyond strategic imperatives, one key thing investors should focus on is the services backlog. Services accounted for about 60% of IBM revenue during the second quarter, and the backlog provides an indication of what the services business will look like going forward. At last count, the backlog stood at $122 billion, up 1% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, with total signings rising 17% in the second quarter. This suggests the services business is doing fine, and investors should pay attention to how the backlog evolves during the third quarter.Revenue from hardware has grown during the past couple of quarters, driven by the launch of the z13 mainframe earlier this year. IBM mainframe revenue tends to spike following a product refresh, driven by client upgrades, and this has helped IBM prevent revenue from falling even further. The company did announce a new line of mainframes, LinuxONE, based on both the z13 and an older model, in August, with the goal of pushing the mainframe as a Linux system. This could help give IBM mainframe revenue a boost going forward, but I would expect mainframe revenue to start to normalize in the coming quarters.It will be the details that matter when IBM reports earnings. The headline numbers will, once again, look downright awful, but the company will eventually lap its major divestitures, and currency issues are ultimately a temporary problem. Investors should focus on the performance of the core of IBM, as well as the growth of its strategic imperatives, to get a sense of where the company is headed."
3 Things IBM Wants You to Know About OpenPOWER,"Sep 15, 2015 at 4:20PM","The evolution of the server market over the past few years has not been kind to International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). While the company's mainframe systems remain entrenched, its Power servers have been losing share to x86-based systems for quite some time. Cloud companies have been building massive, hyperscale data centers, often designing custom systems around chips from Intel. This is where much of the growth in the server industry is occurring, and IBM has completely missed the boat.IBM recognized this problem a few years ago, and in 2013, the company founded the OpenPOWER foundation along with a handful of other member companies. The goal of the OpenPOWER foundation is to build an ecosystem around IBM's POWER architecture, with technology being contributed from all of the foundation's members. IBM now licenses its chip IP to chip designers and third-party POWER systems, as well as IBM's own POWER systems, so they can take advantage of the OpenPOWER ecosystem of hardware and software.OPENPOWER MEMBER COMPANIES. SOURCE: OPENPOWER FOUNDATION.The OpenPOWER foundation has surged in membership over the past two years. The foundation now has nearly 150 members, including big names like Google, Samsung, NVIDIA, and Micron. There have been some major wins, including a supercomputer contract with the Department of Energy, which couples IBM's POWER processors with NVIDIA's GPU accelerators. But the effort is still in the very early stages when it comes to the hyperscale data center and high-performance computing markets. The first third-party hardware products were unveiled a few months ago, but gaining market share will likely be a slow process.Earlier this month, IBM held a webcast to discuss the OpenPOWER initiative and take questions from analysts. Here are three important things that Tom Rosamilia, SVP of IBM Systems, had to say about OpenPOWER.Collaboration is the keyOn its own, it's unlikely IBM could successfully take on Intel in the data center and win a meaningful amount of market share. As Rosamilia explains, the strength of the OpenPOWER initiative is derived from the contributions of members:So, as we look at how we do on our OpenPOWER Foundation strategy, it's to create a vibrant ecosystem, it's not just about us. We are not doing this alone, accelerated innovation through collaboration with partners. It's about what we can get at the systems level in this case by working with partners around how they can attach and plug into the OpenPOWER architecture and then amplifying the capabilities driving industry performance leadership.NVIDIA, for example, contributed its NVLink technology to the OpenPOWER foundation. NVLink allows GPUs to be directly connected to each other, as well as with the CPU, increasing the memory bandwidth available compared to a typical PCE-Express interface. Along with IBM's Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface, which basically allows any accelerator, GPU or otherwise, to be connected directly with the CPU, these technologies greatly reduce the overhead involved in transferring data back and forth between the CPU and GPU, and between GPUs in a multi-GPU system. It doesn't matter how fast a processor is if it spends most of its time waiting for data to be moved around.OpenPOWER is not simply an effort to get POWER chips into the data center. Instead, it's an effort to facilitate the building of systems that, through the contributions of all of the OpenPOWER members, provide a viable alternative to Intel-based solutions, particularly when it comes to analytics and big data applications.Shooting for major market share gainsIBM has essentially no presence in the hyperscale data center market, and little presence in the high-performance computing market. OpenPOWER isn't an attempt to nibble around the edges, picking up the scraps, but instead to win a considerable amount of market share:So, I will [not] predict exactly where it will get to, but we are starting in that space around zero. And clearly, for me, victory would be somewhere in the 10% to 20% range or it's not worth doing. So, that's to give you a range.IBM's goal is to reach a market share of at least 10%-20% in both the hyperscale data center and high performance computing markets, both lofty goals, for sure. Among OpenPOWER members are Google and Rackspace, both providers of cloud computing services and big buyers of Intel chips. A move by either one to replace a significant number of Intel chips with POWER chips could turn the tables, legitimizing OpenPOWER as a real alternative to Intel. Some progress has been made: Google showed off a motherboard it built around a POWER processor last year, and Rackspace has already committed to building an OpenPOWER based platform.There are plenty of use cases where OpenPOWER is not the ideal choice, but with the amount of data analytics happening in hyperscale data centers, there's a major incentive for cloud computing companies to have a viable alternative to Intel.All upsideOne concern regarding IBM's opening of the POWER architecture, allowing third-party POWER chips and POWER systems, is that IBM's own POWER systems business could be cannibalized. But as Rosamilia points out, OpenPOWER is basically all upside for IBM:For example, to the extent that they sell-through hyperscale data centers, it's all upside for me. To the extent they are helping us to go into -- go in deeper into the Linux marketplace, it's all upside for me. We obviously did very well and have done very well, and plan to continue to do very well in the Unix marketplace, but as you all have seen, that marketplace has been in decline, so we have an ever growing share of an ever declining market.In the world of proprietary UNIX systems, IBM does very well. But Linux is the environment of choice for hyperscale data centers, according to data from IDC, and that market will continue to grow regardless of whether IBM participates in that growth. The progress that OpenPOWER members achieve in winning share in the hyperscale data center market is progress that IBM wouldn't have made otherwise, and it doesn't change the downward trajectory of UNIX-based systems.IBM's legacy Power Systems business doesn't work well in a world where cloud computing companies are designing and building custom systems. OpenPOWER is an attempt to tap into markets where IBM would have no access otherwise, and that's all upside for IBM."
1 Simple Reason International Business Machines Corp.'s Profits Could Rise,"Jun 18, 2015 at 8:20AM","International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) recorded about $92.8 billion of revenue during 2014, not much more than the $91.1 billion of revenue the company managed in 2005. Despite this lack of revenue growth, profits have soared, with the company's operating income nearly doubling over the past decade.The market seems to be concerned with IBM's lack of revenue growth, with the stock down about 16% over the past three years, compared with a 56% gain for the S&P 500 during that time. But for the same reason that IBM was able to grow its profits during the past decade despite stagnant revenue, the next decade could bring even more earnings growth. The reason: software.The shift to softwareOver the past decade, hardware has become a decreasingly important part of IBM's business. That's not to say that IBM's hardware doesn't matter anymore -- one of IBM's key strengths is its ability to deliver integrated solutions involving hardware, software, and services. But as a percentage of revenue, hardware doesn't contribute nearly as much as it used to.Taking the place of hardware has been software. In 2004, IBM generated $15.1 billion in revenue from software, or about 15.7% of its total revenue. In 2014, $25.4 billion was derived from software sales, accounting for 27.4% of IBM's total revenue. As IBM shed unproductive businesses and shifted resources over the past decade, software has grown in importance.Why is this important? Because software is by far the most profitable part of IBM's business, and it's getting more profitable every year. In 2004, IBM generated $4.5 billion in pre-tax income from its software business, good for a 26.9% pre-tax margin. In 2014, $10.7 billion of pre-tax income came from software, with a pre-tax margin of 37%.So while total revenue has barely budged over the past decade, IBM's constant shift toward higher-value products, particularly software, has pushed its profits higher.Software-heavy strategic imperativesCloud computing has required IBM to transform itself yet again, and the company's strategy going forward revolves around a few ""strategic imperatives."" The four main areas IBM is focusing on are cloud, analytics, mobile, and security, and the company has shifted $4 billion of spending to these initiatives. In 2014, these strategic imperatives generated $25 billion in revenue, and by 2018 IBM expects this number to rise to $40 billion.This growth in revenue will partly counteract falling revenues elsewhere, and IBM expects just low-single-digit revenue growth annually. But in 2014, revenue from these strategic imperatives was about 50% software, with another 40% coming from services and the rest coming from hardware. As these initiatives grow, IBM's revenue will continue to shift further toward software, driving higher margins even with extremely slow overall revenue growth.IBM's strategy today is really the same strategy that the company has been using for years: Constantly shift the business toward higher value, focusing on areas where IBM can gain a competitive advantage. Software was the key to IBM's growth over the past decade, and it will be the key to IBM's growth in the next decade as well.Get it while it's cheapWith IBM capable of growing its earnings at a faster rate than revenue in the coming years thanks to its continued shift toward software, the stock offers a tremendous value to anyone who can look past the declining revenue. IBM trades at less than 11 times last year's earnings, and its dividend has become one of the best in tech, yielding 3.1% with plenty of room to grow.IBM doesn't need to grow by leaps and bounds in order to justify this valuation, and its buyback program will continue to take advantage of the pessimism surrounding the stock, rewarding investors in the process. In the long run, IBM looks like a great investment at these prices.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

IBM vs. Intel Corporation: The Data Center Battle Escalates,"Nov 24, 2015 at 9:04PM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) used to sell Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) -powered low to mid-range servers. But last year, IBM sold that unit to Lenovo to focus on selling high-end servers and mainframes powered by its own Power processors instead.Since then, IBM has positioned its remaining data center businesses directly against Intel, which holds a formidable 99% market share in server chips. In July, it announced the creation of a 7nm chip, which seemingly targeted Intel's plans to launch 10nm chips in 2017. It also expanded its ""Open Power"" initiative, which shares processor specs, firmware, and software with partners to fuel the third-party production of Power-based servers.SOURCE: INTEL.That's why it wasn't surprising when IBM recently partnered with Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), a maker of FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), to counter Intel's acquisition of FPGA maker Altera. FPGAs are less powerful than IBM's or Intel's server chips, but they can be reprogrammed, making them well-suited for custom uses in connected cars, consumer devices, and airplanes. IBM and Intel are both using FPGAs to complement their server chips by accelerating workloads.What Big Blue wantsIBM's revenue has fallen for 14 consecutive quarters, due to sluggish demand for its core IT services, software, and hardware. Big Blue wants investors to focus on the growth of its ""strategic imperatives"" -- cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security -- which posted 17% annual sales growth last quarter, or 27% on a constant-currency basis excluding its divested System x (Intel-powered server) business. That growth was solid, but it wasn't enough to offset the steep declines in its other aging businesses.Last quarter, IBM's hardware revenues plunged 39% annually and accounted for less than 8% of its top line. Power Systems revenues slipped 3% and system storage revenues fell 19%, but z Systems mainframe revenues rose 15%. The decline in Power Systems revenue was expected, due to Intel's dominance of the data center market. But the growth in mainframes was surprising, since analysts had predicted the death of fridge-sized mainframes for decades.With Open Power, IBM hopes to gain market share against Intel by selling processors to third-party server vendors. In addition to boosting sales of Power CPUs, customers who buy that hardware might be more inclined to buy additional services from IBM's strategic imperatives portfolio. IBM's growing list of backers already includes Rackspace, Chinese vendors Inspur, NeuCloud, and Chuanghe, and Taiwanese company Tyan.Intel shores up its defensesIntel relies heavily on its data center revenues, which rose 12% annually and accounted for 29% of its top line last quarter, to offset declines in its PC and mobile chip businesses. That's why it recently made two big moves to widen its defensive moat against IBM.In October, it bought Saffron AI, a start-up which develops a ""cognitive computing"" platform similar to IBM's Watson. Like Watson, Saffron processes huge amounts of data to generate business insights for clients. By combining Saffron with its own server chips and Altera's FPGAs, Intel can offer companies an all-in-one data center solution which cuts Big Blue out of the loop.That same month, it partnered with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to sell Oracle servers powered by Intel chips to enterprise customers. During a presentation, Oracle CEO Mark Hurd boldly claimed that the new Oracle-Intel architecture will offer faster performance than IBM's systems at a fraction of the cost. Oracle will also push its database and software customers to replace their IBM servers with Oracle-Intel ones instead.But don't forget about QualcommAs Intel shores up its defenses against IBM, it should also keep an eye on Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), which recently started testing its ARM-based server chips in tier-1 data centers. Last year, ARM claimed that its designs could claim 10% of the server chip market by 2017.Qualcomm claims that these new chips, which use a 24-core Qualcomm GPU with custom ARM cores, ""will be competitive in performance and price"" with Intel's Xeons. Like IBM, Qualcomm is also pairing its server CPUs with Xilinx's FPGAs for workload acceleration.Will the underdogs take down Intel?IBM, Xilinx, and Qualcomm don't represent immediate threats to Intel's data center business yet. But over time, IBM's Open Power partners could gain ground in the high-end market as Qualcomm turns heads in the low-end market. If Intel falls behind in this arms race of FPGAs, AI platforms, and other features, it could start losing market share at both ends of the market to these hungry underdogs.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Qualcomm Inc and IBM Love This Company, but Should You?","Nov 24, 2015 at 9:15AM","Earlier this year, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) agreed to buy Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR) for almost $17 billion. That purchase will enhance Intel's data center chips with Altera's field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). On their own, FPGA chips are weaker than Intel's x86 chips, but they can be reprogrammed after manufacture to customize them for use in a wide range of devices such as connected cars, smart appliances, and even airplanes.Intel's purchase of Altera immediately cast a spotlight on Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), the only other major maker of FPGAs, as a potential partner or takeover target for rival chipmakers. To counter Intel's acquisition of Altera, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) both recently signed deals with Xilinx. Qualcomm's upcoming ARM-based server chips and IBM's Power-based ones will both use Xilinx's FPGAs to accelerate their performance.XILINX'S ZYNQ PROCESSORS IN CONNECTED CARS. SOURCE: XILINX.Does the interest from Qualcomm and IBM in Xilinx indicate that the FPGA maker is a good long-term investment? To find out, let's compare Xilinx's business to Altera's, discuss its fundamental growth, and understand the impact of its deals with Qualcomm and IBM.Xilinx vs. AlteraXilinx controls 50% of the FPGA market while Altera controls 39%, according to Morningstar. That's why Xilinx generated 23% more revenue than Altera last year.Last quarter, Altera's revenue fell 20% annually to $399.6 million, missing estimates by $29.4 million. Net income declined 48% to $61.5 million, or $0.20 per share, which also missed expectations by $0.10 a share. Altera blamed those declines on ""choppy conditions"" across multiple markets. It noted that while telecom, wireless networking, computer, storage, and data center sales rose sequentially, sales in the industrial automation, military, and connected auto markets declined. That weakness translated to a 21% year-over-year decline in FPGA revenue and a 5% decline in complex programmable logic device (CPLD) revenue.Xilinx's revenue slipped 13% annually to $527.6 million last quarter, which also missed expectations by $2 million. Net income fell 26% to $127 million, or $0.48 per share, which beat estimates by a penny. Xilinx struggled with the same market conditions as Altera -- robust demand in wired and wireless communications was offset by declines across the industrial, aerospace, and defense markets. However, Xilinx finished the quarter with a gross margin of 70%, compared to Altera's  66.5%.Altera didn't offer any forward guidance due to its upcoming acquisition by Intel. Meanwhile, Xilinx said it expects its third quarter revenue will rise 3% to 7% sequentially to $543.4 million to $564.5 million, which is in line with the consensus estimate of $548.3 million.How much will Qualcomm and IBM help Xilinx?Qualcomm and IBM both want to challenge Intel in the data center market. That's a tough task, since Intel controls 99% of that market with its Xeon chips, which will be augmented with Altera's FPGAs.INTEL-POWERED SERVERS. SOURCE: INTEL.Qualcomm claims that its ARM-licensed data center chips, which use a 24-core Qualcomm CPU with custom ARM cores, ""will be competitive in performance and price"" with Intel's. That's a bold claim, since ARM server chips have mostly been used in low-end ""microservers"" that are purchased in clusters. Nonetheless, Qualcomm asserted last May that its designs could claim 10% of the data center market by 2017.IBM, which sold its Intel-powered server business to Lenovo last year, still sells high-end servers and mainframes that run on its Power processors. IBM is trying to gain ground against Intel in data centers by ""open sourcing"" its Power-based designs to third-party server vendors through its Open Power program. Xilinx's FPGAs will be paired with those designs.Both Qualcomm and IBM have ambitious goals, but it will be hard for either company to loosen Intel's grip on the data center market. Therefore, the overall impact of their plans on Xilinx's revenues should be minimal -- until or unless one or both gains some ground on Intel.Should you buy Xilinx today?Xilinx, as mentioned before, has experienced choppy growth this year, but demand for FPGAs is still expected to rise. Research firm Markets and Markets expects the overall FPGA market to grow at a compound annual rate of 8.1% between 2014 and 2020 to a value of $8.5 billion.Xilinx currently trades at 23 times earnings, which is considerably cheaper than the average P/E of 27 for the semiconductor/integrated circuits industry. It also pays a decent forward annual dividend yield of 2.5%. Looking ahead, it's likely that other chipmakers could sign new partnerships with Xilinx or make buyout offers to challenge Intel. Therefore, it might make sense to buy some shares of Xilinx today, even though the stock is near a 52-week high. "
What If IBM Never Grows Again?,"Sep 23, 2015 at 5:00PM","Shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) have been beaten down during the past couple of years. The stock is down around 30% since hitting a peak in early 2013, and the market doesn't seem to be buying the company's turnaround plan. Revenue has been decreasing, mostly due to IBM selling off underperforming businesses and negative effects related to foreign exchange rates, and a per-share profit target set by the company in 2012 was abandoned late last year.IBM DATA BY YCHARTS.IBM is transitioning its business to take advantage of growth areas -- what the company refers to as ""strategic imperatives."" While these businesses have been growing fast, expanding by 30% year over year during the second quarter on an adjusted basis, poor performance elsewhere is dragging down the company's results. IBM expects to report adjusted earnings between $15.75 and $16.50 per share this year, down from $16.53 per share during 2014, excluding discontinued operations.The market doesn't seem to believe that IBM will ever grow again -- IBM trades at just 9.25 times the low-end of its guidance range for EPS. What if the market's right? What if IBM never manages to return to earnings growth?It turns out that investors buying at current prices will do just fine.A no-growth scenarioThe worst case scenario for IBM is a prolonged earnings decline, so a no-growth scenario may seem optimistic to those who are extremely pessimistic regarding IBM's future. But let's imagine that IBM hits the low-end of its earnings guidance for this year, which would come out to about $15.5 billion of net income based on the current share count, and then flatlines for the foreseeable future.One thing to note: IBM's adjusted earnings, what it calls operating earnings, are not the same as typical non-GAAP earnings reported by other tech companies. While many companies add back stock-based compensation and other dubious items, IBM adjusts only for acquisition-related items, like the amortization of intangible assets, and retirement-related items. These are reasonable adjustments to make.How would IBM's stock fare in this no-growth situation? We'll have to make a few assumptions. First, let's assume that IBM's P/E ratio of 9.25 remains constant. Second, let's assume that the total amount of cash IBM pays out in dividends each year, about $4.55 billion during the past 12 months, also remains constant.Third, let's assume the profits left over after dividend payments are used to buy back shares. As the share count is reduced, both the stock price and the per-share dividend payments will rise, in order to keep the P/E ratio and total dividend payments constant.What would happen during the next 10 years under this scenario? IBM would buy back a little more than half of its own shares, and EPS would more than double as a result. The stock price would reach about $320 per share for an annualized return, excluding the dividend, of 8.15%. Including the dividend payment, the annualized return would surpass 10%, and even higher if those dividends are reinvested.SOURCE: AUTHOR'S CALCULATIONS.That's not bad for a company that's not growing. If IBM were to return to growth, not only would EPS expand even more, but the stock's multiple would likely expand, as well. Of course, if IBM can't maintain its current net income, this scenario goes out the window. But the fact that investors can get an above-average return on a company that's not growing is a testament to how cheap IBM stock has become.We can play with the numbers a little bit: If we assume that IBM earns just $12 billion per year in net income, instead of $15.5 billion, that still leads to an annualized return, including dividends, in excess of 7%. That's not a great return, but it's far from a catastrophe.There are no guarantees in the world of investing. IBM is going through a major transition, and it's hard to say when, or even if, the company will return to growth.But sometimes, shares of a good company become so cheap that the timing simply doesn't matter. IBM comes with a huge margin of safety, and it would take a disaster for investors buying at today's prices to get burned in the long run.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"IBM Is Turning Into Apple, Inc.'s Greatest Enterprise Ally","Aug 8, 2015 at 2:00PM","SOURCE: IBM.Once upon a time, IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) competed intensely in the consumer PC market. The rivalry was probably best captured in the famous photo of Steve Jobs making a rather unsavory gesture toward Big Blue. But that was decades ago, and after IBM officially exited the consumer PC market over 10 years ago to focus on enterprise software and analytics, Apple no longer had a reason to despise the company.Quite the contrary, a year ago the two companies forged an important partnership, whereby IBM would create custom mobile apps tailored to specific enterprise verticals, while also selling iPhones and iPads to its broad base of enterprise customers. The partnership leverages both companies' strengths, and both should start seeing benefits soon.It turns out that the pair are now taking their relationship to the next level, and IBM is perhaps turning into Apple's greatest ally in the enterprise market.IBM wants you to use a Mac at WorkEarlier this week, IBM announced a handful of new Mac at Work services, where it would help enterprise customers securely integrate Macs into their systems, applications, and IT infrastructure. Big Blue mentions that it's already been helping clients adopt Macs in the enterprise, but up until now it's been more of a custom offering. Now it will be a standard offering, since enterprise interest in Macs continues to rise.SOURCE: APPLE.In fact, IBM began offering its own employees a choice between using a Mac or Microsoft Windows PC just a few months ago, whenever those employees were eligible to upgrade their workstations, as part of a new Mac@IBM. Ironically, IBM is encouraging employees to switch to Macs from Thinkpads, the PC brand that it sold to Lenovo in 2004.At the time, IBM was already supporting approximately 15,000 Macs through its BYOD program, and it's expected to purchase about 50,000 additional Macs by year's end. That's a notable chunk of IBM's total employee count of around 380,000 as of the end of 2014.IBM's chief information officer, Jeff Smith, met with Apple to express his interest in deploying more Macs at IBM but said the company would need some collaboration on Apple's part. The executive wants to bring the overall cost of deploying Macs down to equal or less than the cost of deploying PCs. Always the secretive one, Apple initially didn't want to play ball, since it could require giving IBM greater access to internal resources. Smith then asked what Apple's largest enterprise deployment was, and the answer was around 25,000. Smith then told Apple that IBM might purchase between 150,000 and 200,000 Macs and estimates that eventually 50% to 75% of employees would probably pick Macs, which immediately got the Mac maker's attention.Tim Cook flew down the following week.Everyone is doing itAs Big Blue builds experience with its own large-scale Mac deployment in the coming years, it will turn around and leverage that experience to help its own enterprise customers do likewise, since there is growing interest in Macs at the workplace.MARK ZUCKERBERG USES A MACBOOK AT WORK. SOURCE: FACEBOOK.Macs have been on a slow but steady rise in the enterprise because of BYOD programs (even Fool HQ recently started offering Macs as part of a pick-your-own-device, or PYOD, program), so companies are starting to embrace the idea. As the Mac continues to gain consumer market share, those gains are inevitably starting to bleed into the enterprise as IT policies evolve.This isn't just start-ups, either. For example, there are more MacBooks in use at Facebook than Windows PCs -- so much so that Facebook even writes its own custom OS X enterprise security software and then even open sources that software.Keep your friends close, and IBM even closerThe Mac is doing quite literally better than ever. Even though Windows still towers over OS X on a global scale, Apple has made steady progress, gaining market share every year for the past decade. Apple shipped a record 5.5 million Macs in each of the third and fourth quarters last year.Apple used to historically shy away from the enterprise market, in part because the purchaser (IT executives) was usually not the same as the user (employee), but the company seems much more interested in pursuing the immense opportunity there now. While it may take longer since enterprise upgrade cycles tend to be longer, Apple now has a very influential friend whispering into the ears of thousands of enterprise customers and decision makers, telling them why a Mac might be the way to go.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

IBM Just Leapfrogged Over Intel Corporation With the World's Tiniest Chip,"Jul 17, 2015 at 9:30AM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) recently announced the creation of the tiniest chip in the world, which uses 7nm-thick transistors. That's about 1/1,000th the size of a single red blood cell.IBM'S TEST CHIP WITH 7NM TRANSISTORS. SOURCE: IBMThe smallest transistors currently used in mass-produced chips are 14nm. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which launched its first 14nm chips last year, plans to launch 10nm chips by 2017.IBM believes that 7nm chips should start appearing in devices by 2017-2018, and that an entire chip developed with the 7nm process should have roughly 20 billion transistors. By comparison, Intel's Core i7 Broadwell-U, a 14nm chip, has about 1.9 billion transistors.Therefore, IBM's development of a 7nm chip leapfrogs over Intel and indicates that Moore's Law -- which declares that the number of transistors per chip will double every two years -- will continue to hold. But why is IBM developing new processors when it generates most of its revenue from software sales and IT services?Big Blue's game planIBM developed the 7nm chip in collaboration with GlobalFoundries and Samsung, two of the largest chip foundries in the world. IBM still designs chips, but it no longer manufactures or sells them. Instead, it agreed to pay GlobalFoundries $1.5 billion over three years to take over its unprofitable chip-making unit, as part of CEO Ginni Rometty's plan to shed Big Blue's ""empty calories.""GlobalFoundries agreed to be IBM's exclusive provider of certain Power processors over the next decade, in exchange for access to IBM's patent portfolio. IBM's Power processors are mainly installed in its high-end servers and supercomputers, two markets that are firmly dominated by Intel's Xeon processors.The development of the 7nm chip is part of a $3 billion, five-year investment in chip research that IBM announced last year, and it won't be affected by the divestment of the chip-making business. Instead of losing money on chip manufacturing by going head-to-head against Intel, IBM is now taking a more passive approach by beefing up its patent portfolio.Who benefits?By partnering with IBM, Samsung and GlobalFoundries could gain a competitive edge over rival foundries TSMC and Intel. By licensing its chip-making technology to Samsung and GlobalFoundries, IBM can indirectly help numerous ""fabless"" chipmakers that outsource all of their production to make smaller and more powerful chips.IBM's progress toward 7nm chips could also benefit Chinese tech companies. In March, IBM made the controversial decision to license designs for semiconductor chips, servers, and software to Chinese tech firms. This means that IBM's Power chips could eventually play a critical role in the construction of Chinese supercomputers, which could raise objections from the U.S. government. In April, the U.S. government blocked Intel from selling its Xeon chips to all Chinese supercomputers, citing concerns about their use in nuclear simulations.But IBM isn't only sharing its technologies with China. IBM is also licensing its patents to tech firms in other countries through Open Power, a program that it launched in 2013. The alliance -- which includes several other top tech firms -- provides ""base"" technologies to overseas companies that can be subsequently enhanced by local companies. In other words, Open Power seeks to undermine Intel by making hardware ""open source.""Don't count Intel out yetBut Intel can't be beaten that easily. Its Xeon processors control over 90% of the global server market for a simple reason -- they're the most powerful chips in the world. Intel is currently working on a path toward a 7nm transistor, which PC World estimates will be manufactured as early as 2018.Forrester Research analyst Richard Fichera states, ""Intel might have these working in their labs, but they haven't shown anybody."" Fichera also notes that there's ""no guarantee"" that IBM's process is the best way to manufacture 7nm transistors. Nonetheless, Moor Insights and Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead points out that it's encouraging to see more ""concrete proof"" that Moore's Law can continue to hold -- especially from a company other than Intel.The bottom lineLooking ahead, IBM's chip-design business should be considered an IP play instead of a revenue one. By expanding its patent portfolio with new chip designs, IBM can eventually generate passive royalty revenue from chip makers without being exposed to the overhead risks of chip fabrication.When those patents are bundled with other hardware and software licenses through Open Power, they can also help IBM forge stronger alliances in challenging markets like China."
Why Warren Buffett Is Wrong About IBM,"Nov 5, 2015 at 2:14PM","""I don't think there's any company that's done a better job of laying out where they're going to go and then having gone there. They have laid out a road map and I should have paid more attention to it five years ago, where they were going to go in five years ending in 2010. Now they've laid out another road map for 2015.""-- Warren Buffett on IBM (NYSE:IBM) in 2011 No one has been a bigger cheerleader for IBM over past five years than Warren Buffett, but the venerable tech giant seems to have lost that trusty road map.IBM shares got crushed again two weeks ago, falling more than 5% after the company reported its 14th straight quarter of declining sales, with revenue falling 14% and adjusted EPS down 9%.The explanation for IBM's woes is a familiar one. Big Blue's transition from a hardware/software company to a cloud-based services provider is taking longer than expected, and sales and profits continue to fall as IBM sheds its older units. Management has maintained its claim that its strategy is the right one, but the market continues to disagree.The stock is now trading at a five-year low, and has fallen more than a third from its 2013 peak. Buffett once asked for a stock swoon, saying in 2012, ""We should wish for IBM's stock price to languish throughout the five years."" Needless to say, he's gotten his wish.The stock has languished, allowing IBM to buy back even more stock than it otherwise could have, a strategy it hasn't hesitated to implement.But after three-and-a-half years of sliding sales and broken promises about reaching $20 in EPS, it's clear that IBM's management has failed to achieve the goals it set for itself, and Buffett's bet has thus far been a poor one. Looking back at his quotes defending his purchase of IBM, we can now see that his logic was flawed. Here are a few reasons why:Lauding past CEOsWhen he first dumped over $10 billion into Big Blue, Buffett argued that IBM had an excellent record of setting goals for itself and knocking them down, and praised former CEOs Lou Gerstner and Sam Palmisamo for rescuing the company from near-bankruptcy and driving growth ever since.But current CEO Ginni Rommety was named to the leadership chair in 2011, and brought a new strategy. In the tech world, the direction of a single leader can mean the difference between blockbuster success and utter failure, and the accomplishments of Gerstner and Palmisamo mean little as the company transitions into the cloud era. There is no benefit derived from portraits hanging in the board room.Incorrectly assessing IBM's economic moatPerhaps the most important quality of a Buffett stock is that it has an economic moat, or a sustainable competitive advantage. The Oracle of Omaha loves stocks like The Coca-Cola Co, for example, which has an unrivaled brand name and distribution pipeline that provide it with a global reach and fat operating margins.""I would imagine if you're in some country around the world and you're developing your IT department, you're probably going to feel more comfortable with IBM than with many companies,"" Buffett once said.  The statement indicates he believes IBM's competitive advantage is in its relationships with IT departments, along with its reputation and history as a provider of IT services and products. But as IBM transitions into a different kind of company than it's been previously, that advantage loses value.The fast-changing computing landscape explains why other legacy tech giants like Oracle, Hewlett-Packard, and Microsoft have struggled in recent years, compared to younger web-based companies. If Buffett's thesis were true, we'd expect IBM to be leading the cloud revolution. Instead, that title belongs to Amazon.com, which saw the opportunity early and invested heavily in it. According to tech research firm Gartner, Amazon has more than 10 times the computing capacity of the next 14 largest cloud providers.  Investing outside of your wheelhouseBuffett long eschewed investments in tech companies, claiming he didn't understand the industry and couldn't project future cash flows. But he made an exception for IBM for the reasons above, claiming he had studied the company closely over his career, having read its annual reports for 50 years. However, in technology especially, oldest is by no means equivalent to best, and the biggest tech stocks today are much younger than IBM. As the chart below shows, IBM has significantly lagged the biggest names in tech since Buffett first bought shares in 2011.IBM DATA BY YCHARTSFacebook, not included in that chart, is up more than 150% since its 2012 IPO. A bet on any four of those stocks would have delivered more than $10 billion in gains back to Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B). Instead, his conglomerate is in the red on its IBM betBuffett's wish for the share price to languish has been granted, but cheap buybacks without growing earnings are meaningless. After all, the best companies on the market don't thrive because of share repurchases. They invest in research and new opportunities, and develop new businesses that drive profitable growth. IBM, with its sluggish transition into cloud computing and excessive on returning capital to shareholders, seems to have forgotten how to do that.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

7 Companies We'd Buy and Hold for the Next 20 Years,"Dec 14, 2015 at 5:01PM","Many traders hope to get rich quick in the stock market, but over time, the best performance has come from long-term investors who choose companies that can produce solid returns year after year. The key is finding stocks that have the potential for that kind of long-term success over a period of decades. To help uncover some good prospects, we've looked at seven stocks we think are smart for buy-and-hold investors to look at for their portfolios over the next 20 years.Todd Campbell: CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) could be a great investment for people with a 20-year time horizon, because 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day, and the over-65 population is expected to grow to 81 million people in 2040 from 40 million people in 2010.Since CVS Health operates one of the largest retail prescription networks in the country, and runs the second largest pharmacy-benefit manager in the United States, it's perfectly positioned to benefit from volume growth tied to this upcoming (and massive) demographic shift.While drugmakers could get pinched by payers on pricing, CVS Health's role as a middleman should insulate it against risks associated with payer pushback. Instead, attempts to curb drug spending could boost demand for CVS Health's pharmacy benefit manager, which provides services that increase generic drug use and boost drug adherence to prevent costly hospitalizations.Further, low-cost, just-in-time care for illness and injury such as ankle sprains and the flu should allow CVS Health's in-store MinuteClinics to carve out an important (and lucrative) role as healthcare providers.Overall, if CVS Health's sales and profit climb because of boomers, then socking away its shares for the long haul when they're trading at a forward P/E ratio of 16.6 could be savvy.Steve Symington: Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has handsomely rewarded investors since its IPO almost 19 years ago, including a nearly 1,300% gain over the past decade as of this writing. But even with Amazon stock trading near all-time highs, I think the online retail behemoth has plenty more to give over the next two decades.For now, top-line growth remains the name of the game. Amazon's revenue last quarter climbed 23% year over year to $25.4 billion, and it would have risen an even more impressive 30% had it not been for the negative effects of foreign exchange. Within that, net product sales climbed 15% to just under $18.5 billion. But as fellow Fool Andrew Tonner pointed out recently, e-commerce only accounted for around 7.4% of total U.S. retail sales last quarter, which means Amazon's retail business still enjoys an enormous runway for stateside growth. At the same time, North America still represented more than 59% of Amazon's total revenue in Q3, leaving plenty of room for Amazon to grow its international retail presence.But Amazon is also about much more than ""just"" the retail business today. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose an impressive 78% year over year last quarter to nearly $2.1 billion, comprising just 8.2% of Amazon's total sales. Meanwhile, AWS generated superior operating margin at 25%, which meant at $521 million, AWS' operating income actually came in higher last quarter than the $472 million collectively mustered by Amazon's core global retail operations.Assuming AWS can sustain this attractive combination of growth and profitability in the coming years as Amazon continues to increase its share of the budding e-commerce industry, I see no reason Amazon stock can't continue generating outsized returns for the foreseeable future.Andres Cardenal: The tech sector can be a promising niche for investors hunting for companies with superior potential for growth and innovation. On the other hand, the industry is also particularly dynamic and always changing -- the winner of today can easily turn out to be the loser of tomorrow.For this reason, a diversified approach to investing in the tech industry could be a smart way to bet on many of the most innovative businesses in the world, while at the same time keeping company-specific risk at bay, and Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLK) looks like a convenient vehicle to implement such strategy.The ETF invests in 72 companies from the technology sector of the S&P 500 index, and big industry players account for most of its portfolio. Among the leading positions in Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF we find many of the strongest and most recognized names in the industry, including Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and Alphabet. The ETF holds nearly $14.4 billion in assets under management, and it has a conveniently low expense ratio of 0.15% annually.It's hard to tell which tech company will profit the most over the next 20 years, but chances are that companies in the tech business as a whole will create a lot of value for investors over the long term, and investors in Technology Select Sector SPDR stand to benefit substantially from this value creation.Dan Caplinger: I love stocks that get hammered on purely short-term issues, and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is a great example. The Mexican-food fast-casual chain has seen its stock fall sharply following an outbreak of E. coli that the Centers for Disease Control has linked to the company's restaurants. Originally, the outbreak appeared to be limited to the Pacific Northwest, but more recent reports in states in the Midwest and further east suggest at least the potential of a more widespread problem.Past problems with restaurant chains and E. coli outbreaks have led to dramatic sales declines, so many are concerned that Chipotle will suffer long-term damage from the episode. Yet at least so far, the number of cases involved with Chipotle is far less than in past outbreaks that other restaurant chains experienced.If the company is able to demonstrate that the problems were outliers rather than symptomatic of longer-term practices at its restaurant locations, then Chipotle's loyal customer base is likely to give the chain the benefit of the doubt and continue to allow it to grow. The risk of mismanaging the epidemic does exist, but given Chipotle's past commitment to high-quality healthy food, the company is more likely than not to find a path back to prosperity after the episode blows over.Tim Green: Given the ongoing revenue declines at International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), recommending that the stock be bought and held for 20 years may seem like a questionable proposition. Revenue has slumped for 14 quarters in a row, and the stock is down more than 25% over the past three years.But IBM is not a company that attempts to grow revenue at all costs, and it's not a company that aims to be the biggest of anything. The rise of cloud computing is viewed as a threat to IBM's business model, which involves selling solutions including hardware, software, and services, but IBM has proven again and again that it is capable of adapting.In the 1950s, when the company was highly successful selling and leasing mechanical accounting machines, it became clear that computers were the future, and IBM jumped on the opportunity. In the 1990s, when PCs and servers nearly killed the mainframe business, IBM transformed itself again by focusing on high-margin opportunities, building a global services business, and growing its presence in software, all while resisting misguided calls to break up the company.IBM now faces another critical juncture, but unlike in the 1990s, when the company was losing billions each year, IBM is still wildly profitable. The company's new focus is data, and IBM is investing heavily in its business analytics and cognitive computing capabilities. Watson, IBM's machine learning system, is being pushed as a tool in industries ranging from finance to healthcare, helping businesses make better decisions by drawing insights from mountains of unstructured data.Twenty years from now, IBM will likely look quite a bit different than it does today. But the strategy, to focus on high-value products and services where the company can gain a competitive advantage, is a sound one, and I suspect that shareholders buying the stock today will be pleased 20 years from now.Jason Hall: To start, you'd need a company with strong competitive advantage operating in an industry with high barriers to entry, and a low risk of disruption. Very few companies have one or two of those characteristics. MasterCard (NYSE:MA) has all of them. MasterCard operates one of the largest payment processing networks on the planet, but it also has huge opportunity for growth. Today, MasterCard operates in 150 countries around the world and conducts over 30 billion transactions annually, but plastic -- both real swipes and the virtual kind via mobile -- barely scratches the surface of total transactions. Well over half of all transactions in the U.S. are still cash or check, while that amount skyrockets to more than 80% in the rest of the world. MasterCard is barely scratching the surface. When it comes to competition, mobile payments aren't a threat, but a catalyst since these transactions still require MasterCard or other processor's networks to facilitate the actual transaction that merchants depend on to get paid. Lastly -- and this is what makes MasterCard such a great long-term investment -- is the steady cash flows and relatively low cost of growth. MasterCard's network won't require significant expense to expand. This means more growth flows to the bottom line, and should be paid to investors.MasterCard stock only yields about 1% today, but the dividend has been increased 1,000% over the past five years. In other words, people who bought the stock at $35 in 2011 are getting a 6% yield on their original investment -- not to mention a tripling of the share price. Extrapolate even a fraction of that return over 20 years, and it's life-changing. Sign me up. George Budwell: Isis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:IONS) is my pick because the company has one of the deepest and most diverse clinical pipelines in the entire pharmaceutical industry. That's particularly impressive in light of the fact that the drugmaker's present market cap is only $7 billion.Although its first-approved product, Kynamro, an injected medicine for a genetically based form of super-high bad cholesterol, hasn't performed particularly well in terms of sales, Isis has significantly refined its antisense drug platform since Kynamro's development, leading to the advent of several experimental products with blockbuster potential.Going forward, investors need to keep a particularly close eye on the clinical progress of the company's pediatric spinal muscular atrophy treatment called ""Nusinersen,"" the next-generation cholesterol drug Volanesorsen, and the blood-clotting disorder treatment ISIS-FXIrx. All three of these experimental drugs are making steady progress in the clinic and have the potential to turn into major value drivers for Isis in the years to come as a result.While there's no guarantee when it comes to developmental-stage biopharmas, Isis does offer investors a rich clinical pipeline that should produce at a least a handful of major drugs over the next decade or so, making it a great stock to own for the long haul.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

International Business Machines Bets Big On the Internet of Things,"Nov 17, 2015 at 7:00PM","IMAGE SOURCE: FLICKR.The Internet of Things (IoT) -- which entails essentially ""connecting"" the world around us -- was a seemingly far-fetched idea just a couple of years ago, but has quickly become a legitimate, fast-growing new market. In fact, some pundits have predicted it could become a $1.7 trillion market in just five years. Other predictions aren't quite so lofty, but most agree the opportunity is mammoth.The burgeoning IoT market is often associated with the billions of devices expected to be sold in the coming years, and that's certainly a significant opportunity for providers including Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), with its Nest ""smart"" hub.One conservative estimate from research firm Gartner suggests that nearly 6.5 billion IoT ""things"" will be in use worldwide next year, a 30% jump from 2015. That's great news for the Alphabets of the world, but tells only part of the IoT story. Gartner also said it expects IoT-related services will garner $235 billion in sales in 2016, and ""are the real driver of value in IoT."" On the services side of the IoT fence is where IBM (NYSE: IBM) lands, and it's fully vested in leading the charge.Devices vs. dataThe market for devices is expected to account for nearly 32% of the entire IoT market in five years, with the balance consisting of solutions including data storage, security, and software-as-a-service (SaaS). Already Alphabet boasts nearly $2 billion in ""Other revenue,"" an 11% improvement over last year, and that could rise thanks to IoT.If its Nest hub hits the mark with consumers -- Alphabet recently unveiled a Nest three-pack smart camera deal for $497 -- nabbing a piece of the estimated IoT device pie could really jump-start its non-advertising revenue. But as the market matures in the coming years, data storage, SaaS, analytics, and security solutions will rule the IoT revenue roost, and it's in these key areas IBM has placed its bet.Rolling the diceAs the market matures, enterprise -- think business rather than consumer-solutions including IBM's suite of IoT services -- is where the most revenue will be generated. It seems IBM has read similar predictions which would help to explain why it announced a whopping $3 billion investment over the next four years to establish and grow a distinct IoT business unit.That kind of commitment isn't for the faint of heart, particularly when it's combined with the billions IBM has spent to expand its cloud, big data, and analytics offerings. But its IBM's far-reaching capabilities in these key areas that positions it so well to gain a foothold in the fast-growing IoT market. Why? Because an ancillary benefit to IoT devices is the unprecedented amount of data collected.Take Alphabet's Nest hub as an example: Not only will Alphabet benefit from the actual sale of the device, but one thing the search king is undeniably good at is tracking, storing, and utilizing user data. Now imagine the world around us -- homes, cars, and even cities -- all inter-connected. The amount of information will become enormous, and IBM is betting enterprises are going to need a hand in sifting through all that data to securely store and formulate actionable results. And based on the predictions, IBM's IoT efforts are spot on.In addition to IBM's IoT investment, it's announced a string of acquisitions and infrastructure investments in its cognitive computing wonder Watson to crunch formerly unheard of volumes of data. Cloud computing and big data are also critical areas of CEO Ginni Rometty's ""strategic imperatives,"" and both play integral roles in securely storing and analyzing IoT-related data.Folks like Alphabet can, and likely will, benefit from the sale of Nest and similar devices, but it's not exactly a do-or-die situation for the online ad king. But with so much invested -- both money and human capital -- IBM needs its IoT and related strategic imperatives to succeed, and there are inklings that it's making some inroads.As of last quarter, Rometty's combined strategic imperatives accounted for 27% of total revenue and plans are to increase that figure to 40% in the next few years. For that to happen, IBM's IoT unit must show a return on the time and billions of dollars invested. Can Rometty and team do it? Considering its depressed stock price and nearly 4% dividend yield, IBM's push to lead the IoT services wars is worth the bet.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

5 Disruptive Tech Trends That Could Dominate in 2016,"Sep 26, 2015 at 2:00PM","SOURCE: IBM.Innovation and growth can be powerful return drivers for investors positioned in the right businesses. For this reason, we asked five of our top contributors to share with our readers the most disruptive tech trends to watch in 2016 and, perhaps more important, the companies that stand to benefit materially from these breakthrough innovations.In the following roundtable, we take a deep look at crucial tech developments to watch next year and how to profit from them.Andres Cardenal (IoT). The Internet of Things, or IoT, may sound like a complex idea, but it's a simple yet powerful concept. Devices around the world, whether it's a smartphone, a home appliance, or an airplane, include a varying amount of sensors inside them. Those sensors are increasingly interconnecting via Wi-Fi and other technologies. IoT is about interconnecting, and creating intelligence from all the devices around us.As Tim Brugger explains in a moment, IoT is setting the stage for major developments in areas such as Big Data, and IBM (NYSE:IBM) is a key player in both segments. For example, the company is making big inroads in transportation and machinery, where it has established alliances with leading players such as Airbus and Cummins.IBM is leveraging its technologies and massive amounts of data in different areas such as environment, weather, and maps to help planes fly smoother, saving fuel and reducing operational risks. Engines powered by IoT technologies can predict when maintenance is required before anything goes wrong, and they're also optimized for more efficient running.This game-changing technology can offer enormous cost savings and massive productivity enhancements over the years. The possibilities are enormously exciting when it comes to the multiple benefits of IoT, and everything indicates that the technology is set to continue gaining traction in 2016 and beyond.Tim Brugger (Big Data): In part because the world around us is becoming ""connected"" through a growing number of IoT sensors, mobile devices, and the world's affinity for the Internet, the sheer volume of information available is already staggering. And by most accounts, we're just skimming the surface. All that data offers a world of opportunities for businesses to better market to prospective customers, develop in-depth user profiles, and enhance our daily lives, among other possibilities.The problem is that business execs are already uncertain what to do with all the information, or Big Data. According to a recent study, Big Data will become a $33 billion industry this year, and a whopping 89% of business leaders believe Big Data will ""revolutionize business operations the same way the Internet did."" But how? That's where predictive analytics and cognitive computing providers such as IBM enter the picture.In January 2014, IBM said it was investing $1 billion to fund a new business unit featuring its Watson supercomputer. Since then, IBM's Watson division has made multiple acquisitions to expand its reach, including the recent $1 billion deal for Merge Healthcare. IBM also announced new deals with Boston Children's Hospital, among others, and is opening a new Watson world headquarters soon. And it's working.IBM wouldn't divulge specific revenue results of its Big Data push, but it did help drive a more than 20% jump in its business analytics unit last quarter, after accounting for currency headwinds. Conservative estimates suggest that Big Data will become a nearly $100 billion market in 10 years, but it will be a disruptive technology long before that. And IBM is poised to lead the charge.Daniel B. Kline (endless payment): While subscriptions have always been a factor on the enterprise side of the software business, they're now moving into the consumer end of things. The leader has been Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has managed to move a large part of its Office customer base into a subscription model. In the most recent quarter, the company grew its Office 365 subscriber base to 15.2 million users, up 3 million from the previous quarter. In doing so, essentially the company has locked in a recurring revenue stream. In the past, those numbers were harder to predict because consumers would often skip one or more upgrades to the productivity suite, opting to stick with older software they already owned. Offering Office as a subscription product also opens it up to a potentially larger audience since it no longer requires a large upfront outlay of cash.Microsoft isn't the only major player using the model, as Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has made its popular suite of creativity tools available strictly on a subscription basis. That's a blow to the people who would use the same version of Photoshop for years without upgrading, but it also allows people who might not have been able to pay hundreds of dollars at once access to the products.The endless payment is a model that appears to appeal to millennials, and even wireless phone-service providers are adopting it. It has pluses for the company and the consumer: The business gets a long-term predictable revenue stream, and the consumer gets access to the latest software (and, in the case of phones, hardware).Of course, the consumer never gets to pay off the software or device, but the younger generation specifically seems OK with that as long as the product keeps improving. This model opens up technology to more people in the same way that leasing a car lets someone buy more vehicle than he or she could otherwise afford. It's a disruptive model that will almost certainly become more prevalent quickly. Tim Green (budget smartphones): The way most people buy smartphones in the U.S. is going through a dramatic change. Phone subsidies and two-year contracts are largely a thing of the past, and customers will now pay for their data plans and devices separately. This may not seem like that big of a change, and indeed, users of high-end phones probably won't see a significant increase or decrease in their total monthly bill, assuming their phone is paid for in installments. But budget phones made no sense under the subsidy system, and 2016 could be the year that cheap, good-enough phones go mainstream.Under the subsidy system, a customer's monthly bill was the same regardless of what phone was purchased. The phones themselves were subsidized, with a phone that would retail for $650 generally costing $200, and a phone retailing for $450 potentially being free. Prices varied by carrier, but any phone with a retail price of $450 or lower would be either free or available for a very low price. In other words, there was no real price difference between a $200 phone and a $450 phone, making budget phones an illogical choice.Now that customers will pay the full price of phones, either upfront or in installments, budget phones are genuinely cheaper for consumers. There are a variety of phones running Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android operating system that sell for $200 or less and are perfectly capable devices, such as the Zenfone 2 from Asus and the Moto G from Motorola. I would expect the average selling price of phones in the U.S. to decline as the built-in bias toward high-end phones disappears, and Google may even win some market share back from a certain maker of iDevices.Steve Symington (drones): Of all the tech trends to enter the spotlight in 2016, I think few will be more visible than the rise of small unmanned aerial vehicles -- more popularly known as drones -- for both consumer and commercial uses. For that, we can partly thank increasingly affordable, capable drones from companies such as China-based DJI, which currently commands around 70% of the estimated $1.4 billion market. According to recent research from Goldman Sachs, that market could nearly double next year, and almost triple by 2017.It was hardly surprising earlier this year, then, when GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) confirmed plans to help spur this growth with the launch of its own quadcopter in the first half of 2016. Specifically, GoPro CEO Nick Woodman elaborated during last quarter's conference call that it will be a ""differentiated quadcopter capture solution"" with a ""much improved out-of-box user experience"" -- a stance that's in line with GoPro's typical focus on usability. Combine that with the fact GoPro already enjoys an impressive distribution network for its flagship HERO series cameras, and it seems clear its entrance should only serve to make small drones that much more ubiquitous in 2016."
The Future of Healthcare: 3 Stocks to Watch,"Jun 14, 2015 at 1:02PM","SOURCE: ROCHE. Where is healthcare headed? The answer -- or more precisely, the answers -- to that question hold the power to create fortunes over the coming years. And while no one can predict with 100% certainty where healthcare is headed, there are some trends likely to become increasingly more important.The good news for investors in the here and now is that a handful of companies stand out as leaders in these areas. Here are three stocks to watch that could very well play key roles in the future of healthcare.1. Roche Holding AG (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY)If you haven't heard of personalized medicine yet, you will soon. The idea is to customize medical treatment to the specific needs of a patient. Imagine, for example, a drug designed to match up with your specific genetic profile to most effectively combat a disease. You won't need a great imagination for this, because personalized medicine is already available.Swiss healthcare company Roche currently ranks as the leader in the personalized medicine space. Roche made personalized medicine the core of its strategy back in 2006 and has achieved notable progress in targeting HER2-positive breast cancer with drugs including Herceptin, Perjeta, and Kadcyla.SOURCE: ROCHE. Roche maintains a star position in the world of personalized medicine in large part because it has two business segments that work closely together -- pharmaceuticals and diagnostics. Diagnostics is important because to know whether or not a drug targeting a specific genetic biomarker will help a patient, a physician must first know if the patient has that biomarker.Despite its pioneering research in personalized medicine, that leadership hasn't payed off yet for Roche investors. Its stock stands 6% lower than the share price from one year ago (as well as five years ago and 10 years ago). Over the long run, though, Roche should experience better results as its personalized medicine investment pays off.2. iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT)Another game-changing healthcare technology has been around for quite a while. Telemedicine got its start over four decades ago, with hospitals using technology to reach patients in remote areas. However, regulatory and reimbursement obstacles held back the use of electronic exchange of medical information to treat patients remotely. That is changing now in a major way.SOURCE: IROBOTPlenty of companies offer telemedicine products, but one of the most intriguing is iRobot. The company is probably best known for its Roomba vacuuming robots. However, iRobot seems poised to play a key role in the future of healthcare with its RP-VITA remote presence robot.RP-VITA was developed by iRobot in partnership with In Touch Health. The robot can self-navigate through hospitals and other healthcare facilities and allows physicians, nurses, and pharmacists to consult with patients remotely. RP-VITA also supports digital stethoscopes, otoscopes, and ultrasound imaging that can be used to gather patients' clinical information for review by medical professionals at another location.As cool as this technology might be, though, it hasn't generated a tremendous amount of money for iRobot so far. Roomba and other home robots drive around 90% of revenue for the company and will probably continue to do so for the next few years.However, the use of healthcare robots like RP-VITA and its successors should increase significantly. Don't be surprised if many homes have caregiver robots that connect to remote clinicians within the next 20 years. At this point, iRobot looks to be the most likely leader for this emerging trend. 3. IBM (NYSE:IBM)The practice of medicine requires extensive knowledge of human anatomy and physiology, diseases, and appropriate treatments. Thanks to continued research and innovation, the amount of clinical knowledge to master is growing at a frantic pace. Meanwhile, the U.S. is poised to face a physician shortage of up to 90,000 doctors by 2025, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. This sounds like a perfect challenge for artificial intelligence.IBM has taken up this challenge in a more ambitious way than perhaps any other company. Big Blue's Watson first gained fame by beating human contestants on the TV game show Jeopardy!. Watson's greatest opportunity, though, might be in healthcare.SOURCE: IBM.Watson was designed to learn similarly to how humans learn. It reads millions of documents in just seconds. Human experts train Watson on how to interpret all of that information. Watson can then help evaluate the information and assist in decision making.IBM's cognitive computing technology is already in use at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Watson pores through vast quantities of information, including patient data, scientific journals, and medical meetings. Memorial Sloan Kettering clinical experts have been training Watson to make sense of all of this information, with a special focus on breast and lung cancers. Over time, Watson should become increasingly more effective at helping physicians determine the most effective evidence-based treatment options for patients.The potential for Watson to impact care for patients is enormous. It's still too early for the technology to make a meaningful financial impact for IBM, but if we could peer into the future, I suspect we'd find a different picture altogether. IBM, the granddaddy of technology stocks, could very well be one of the most influential healthcare players over the next few decades. Clear and present opportunityWhile all three of these companies could become huge winners as the future of healthcare becomes reality, one stands out as the best pick for right now. IBM boasts a relatively low valuation and pays a solid dividend, currently yielding 3.1% annually. Big Blue's stock might not be red-hot right now, but it appears to be a smart buy. And the future awaits.  10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

International Business Machines Corp.: A Great Dividend Stock at a Low Price,"Jul 29, 2015 at 10:20AM","After its recent earnings report, shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) tumbled. It's been a tumultuous couple of years for IBM as it transitions its business to the cloud, and its results have been choppy. Shares of IBM now trade below $160, down about 20% from a recent high reached in early 2013.IBM's stock declined, but the company's dividend keeps on growing. Over the past decade, IBM has hardly been a great dividend stock, with yields typically below 2%. But over the past 18 months, IBM's dividend yield has shot up to decade highs, on par with other technology giants. Ironically, the increased yield is largely a function of the share weakness.With a high dividend yield, now about 3.25% based on the most recent dividend payment, and plenty of room for further dividend growth, IBM has become one of the most attractive dividend stocks in the technology sector.Finally an attractive dividendIBM has typically favored share buybacks as a means to return cash to shareholders. The dividend, while growing quickly over the past decade, has never represented a high percentage of IBM's earnings or free cash flow. This has resulted in a dividend yield that has been lower than that of other large technology companies.But IBM's falling stock price, along with continued growth in the dividend, has changed the story:SOURCES: IBM AND YAHOO FINANCEOver the past decade, IBM's annual dividend payments have grown at a compound annual growth rate of just over 20%. The most recent dividend increase, an 18.2% bump that came earlier this year, was right in line with this historical rate.With a 3.25% dividend yield, IBM is now an attractive dividend stock compared with other large technology companies.CompanyDividend YieldIBM3.25%Microsoft2.73%Apple1.69%Cisco2.98%Intel3.39%SOURCE: MORNINGSTAR.Of course, the dividend yield is only half of the equation. Future dividend growth is the other half, and IBM has plenty of room to rapidly grow its dividend in the years ahead.Plenty of room to growShare buybacks have eaten up quite a bit of IBM's cash flow in recent years, but the company has recently signaled that it would slow the pace of buybacks down. In its investor-day presentation, IBM guided for a 2% to 3% reduction in shares annually, and with 75% of its free cash flow expected to be returned to shareholders each year, this creates a runway for further dividend growth.IBM will pay out $5.20 per share in dividends over the next year, based on its most recent dividend payment. The low end of IBM's non-GAAP earnings guidance calls for $15.75 per share, putting the payout ratio based on this number at a measly 33%. Based on free cash flow from last year, which IBM expects to grow modestly this year, the payout ratio is a higher 41.5%.Free cash flow is currently depressed relative to net income, but in the long run, IBM expects its free cash flow to be around 90% of net income in any given year. Regardless, a payout ratio between 30% and 40% can certainly be expanded, especially with a lid being kept on share buybacks.Even if earnings remain stagnant for a few years as IBM's transition carries on, double-digit dividend growth can continue. Eventually, earnings growth will limit dividend growth, but in the long run, IBM expects to return to high-single-digit earnings growth if everything goes according to plan.A great dividend stockIBM's results are going to be choppy as the company continues its transformation, and this choppiness has generated quite a bit of pessimism surrounding the stock. This has pushed the stock price down, and IBM's dividend yield is now on par with other large technology companies. Along with a history of rapid dividend growth and room to grow the dividend further, there's a lot for dividend investors to like."
"Stocks to Watch in IT Services: Infosys, IBM, and Accenture","Jul 10, 2015 at 3:00PM","The IT (Information Technology) services sector generally isn't considered a high-growth tech industry. Research company Gartner estimates that worldwide spending on IT services will rise just 2.5% annually this year, down from 2.7% growth in 2014. Nonetheless, it's important for tech investors to understand what IT services are, how they differ from other IT sectors, and which top companies to follow.SOURCE: PIXABAY.What are IT services?The IT services market includes a wide range of software support companies, communication service suppliers, network integrators, data center specialists, outsourcing partners, desktop management companies, and IT consultancy firms. It does not include data center hardware, enterprise devices (desktops, laptops, mobile devices), enterprise software, or telecom services.Yet the IT services market is closely tied to those other IT markets. An expected decline in demand for enterprise software this year, for example, reduces revenue from software support services. Meanwhile, higher demand for data servers, fueled by more cloud-based services, boosts demand for data center specialists. To gain a better understanding of this industry, let's discuss three top players in the IT services sector -- Infosys (NYSE:INFY), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Accenture (NYSE:ACN).InfosysInfosys is one of India's largest IT service firms. Its primary domestic rivals are WiPro (NYSE:WIT), Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH), and TCS, the largest IT service firm in the country. Infosys employs over 170,000 people, compared to TCS' massive workforce of over 300,000. But just like TCS, Infosys' largest market is North America.Infosys discusses its company's future like software upgrades. During the company's first two decades, ""Infosys 1.0"" focused on improving its staff's ability to write code efficiently for customers across different time zones. During its third decade, ""Infosys 2.0"" focused on pursuing IT service deals across multiple industries. With ""Infosys 3.0"", which started in 2010, there are three top priorities -- cost reductions, sales effectiveness, and delivery effectiveness. Looking ahead, Infosys and its Indian competitors all face the challenges of intense price competition and the challenge of keeping costs low with massive employee headcounts.Nonetheless, Infosys continues to post decent top and bottom line growth. Last year, Infosys' revenue grew 7% annually on a constant currency basis to $8.7 billion as its net profit improved 15%. The stock currently pays a forward annual dividend yield of 2.9%, and paid out 59% of its free cash flow as dividends over the past 12 months. It also expects annual revenue growth, on a constant currency basis, to accelerate to 10% to 12% this year (fiscal 2016). Therefore, Infosys represents a fairly solid way to gain some exposure to the Indian IT market, which grew 7.1% annually last year, according to IDC.IBMIBM's IT services business is split into two units: Global Business Services (GBS) and Global Technology Services (GTS). Last year, the GBS and GTS units respectively accounted for 19% and 40% of IBM's top line. But between 2011 and 2014, IBM's annual GBS revenue fell 8%, and GTS revenue slipped 9%. IBM blamed those declines on weak client spending, sluggish demand in the software sector, divestments of lower-margin businesses, and a strong dollar eating up overseas profits.IBM is an American company, but roughly a quarter of its staff is based in India, making it one of Infosys' chief competitors. However, cloud services and analytics platforms (like Watson) are now automating more IT service tasks and reducing demand for human employees. That's why IBM reduced its India-based workforce from 165,000 in 2011 to 113,000 last year.This doesn't mean IBM is backing out of India -- instead, it means it's trying to grow its business without adding more employees. That's why IBM is placing such emphasis on the growth of its five ""strategic imperatives"" -- the cloud, data analytics, mobile, social, and security businesses. Revenue from those businesses rose 16% annually in 2014 and accounted for 27% of IBM's top line. As more businesses rely on automated IT services delivered over cloud platforms, IBM believes that percentage could rise to 44% by 2018.AccentureAccenture's IT services business provides similar services as IBM and Infosys. But unlike IBM, Accenture is mostly a ""pure play"" IT services company that has grown its top line over the past few years. Between 2010 and 2014, Accenture's annual revenues grew 38% as its net income improved 54%.Research company Everest Group attributes that growth to Accenture's ability to communicate more clearly with CFOs and business leaders than IBM. IBM's customers, on the other hand, often accuse Big Blue of lacking ""price competitiveness, operating flexibility, and customer intimacy,"" according to a recent survey conducted by Value Leadership Group CEO Peter Schumacher. One of Accenture's most notable accomplishments was fixing the disastrously broken Obamacare website earlier this year.Therefore, investors looking for a more focused play on IT services should take a closer look at Accenture.The bottom lineThe IT services sector is a slow-growth one, but demand isn't expected to dry up anytime soon. Therefore, investors should keep an eye on fierce price competition, the rise of cloud-based and automated IT solutions, and the industry reputations of the leading players to better understand this complex and constantly evolving sector.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Intel Corporation Buys an AI Platform to Challenge IBM's Watson,"Nov 3, 2015 at 12:00PM","Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) recently acquired Saffron AI, a start-up that develops a ""cognitive computing"" platform similar to IBM's (NYSE:IBM) Watson, for an undisclosed price. Saffron's platform collects a wide variety of data based on topics provided by clients, then maps out similarities and relationships to better ""understand"" them. The process reportedly mimics human reasoning to generate insights for clients. The software then responds with a combination of natural language processing enhanced by a client-submitted vocabulary of industry-specific jargon.IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL.Simply put, the platform gathers lots of data, crunches it much faster than humans can, and uses it to provide suggestions regarding business decisions. While owning that kind of machine learning platform helps big data companies like IBM, it might seem like an odd purchase for a chipmaker like Intel.Let's take a closer look at why Intel bought an AI platform, and how it could impact IBM and other big data players.Understanding Intel's long-term planOver the past few quarters, Intel's sales and earnings have been weighed down by two big things -- sluggish PC sales and big mobile subsidies. To diversify its business away from those two tough markets, Intel is beefing up its Internet of Things (IoT), data center, and non-volatile memory businesses -- which all posted double-digit annual sales growth last quarter.Intel doesn't have a meaningful market share in mobile chips, but it plans to expand into the IoT market (which consists of wearables, smart appliances, and connected cars) with tiny new modules like Curie. Intel hopes that growth will complement its dominance of the PC chip market. All the data flows from IoT devices and PCs to data centers, where Intel enjoys a near-monopoly in chips.INTEL'S CURIE. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL.However, many companies now want server chips that are optimized for industry-specific jobs. That's why Intel agreed to acquire Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR), which makes reprogrammable chips, for $16.7 billion earlier this year. These type of chips can also be used for AI applications. By combining its own server chips, Altera's FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), and Saffron's AI platform, Intel can offer companies an all-in-one data center solution that greatly widens its defensive moat against any potential competitors.Retaliating against Big BlueTo understand where IBM fits into this story, we should remember that Big Blue once owned an Intel-based server business. However, IBM sold that business to Lenovo last year to focus on high-end mainframes designed for its own Power processors.By bundling these servers, data analytics, cloud services, and the Watson AI platform together, IBM's Power chips could keep Intel's Xeons out of the high-end mainframe market, which handles extreme workloads for data processing. This strategy probably annoys Intel, which relies heavily on data center growth to offset weak demand for PC chips.That's why Intel joined forces with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to set up a cloud computing data center that runs on Oracle's servers powered by Intel chips. The two companies recently announced that the test project, known as Apollo, was successful and ready to be marketed to enterprise customers. Oracle also announced that it would dump IBM's servers and offer Oracle-Intel servers instead.Should IBM be worried?IBM should interpret Intel's purchase of Saffron and its partnership with Oracle as a declaration of war to control the high-end server and mainframe market. This could be a big problem, since sales of mainframes were one of the few bright spots in IBM's business. Last quarter, when Big Blue's overall revenue declined for the 14th consecutive quarter, z Systems mainframe product revenues rose 15% annually even as total Systems Hardware revenue plunged 39%.Intel's entrance into the AI market could also disrupt IBM's ambitious plans for Watson. Last year, IBM invested $1 billion to create a dedicated business unit for Watson, which is intended to complement the company's five ""strategic imperatives"" -- its cloud, data analytics, mobile, social, and security businesses. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty previously told CNBC that Watson was essentially the cognitive core of IBM's data and analytics businesses.The key takeawayIntel's recent moves certainly won't cripple IBM, but IBM is standing on much shakier ground than Intel. Most analysts expect worldwide PC demand to stabilize next year, which would strengthen Intel's core business. When that happens, growth in data centers, IoT, and memory chips would become complementary sources of growth instead of core ones. IBM needs its strategic imperatives to boost its sales growth back into positive territory, and Intel's roadmap for digital dominance could throw a wrench into those turnaround efforts.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Intel Corporation and Oracle Corporation Teamed Up Against IBM,"Nov 1, 2015 at 2:25PM","Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) recently set up huge cloud computing data centers to test out Oracle servers powered by Intel chips. That project, known as Apollo, just completed its testing phase, and the two companies are now ready to sell Oracle-Intel servers to enterprise customers.This move pits the two tech titans directly against IBM (NYSE:IBM), which sells high-end servers and mainframes. Oracle also announced that it would convince its database and software customers to replace their IBM servers with Oracle-Intel ones instead. Let's take a look at why Intel and Oracle are teaming up against IBM, and what this strategy means for all three companies.ORACLE'S EXADATA SOFTWARE/HARDWARE PLATFORM. SOURCE: ORACLE.Why Intel wants to take down IBMIn the past, IBM sold Intel-powered low- to mid-range servers. But last year, Big Blue sold that business to Lenovo to focus on selling high-margin servers and mainframes, powered by its own Power processors, instead. That turned IBM from Intel's partner into its competitor in the enterprise server market.Intel holds a near monopoly in the data center market with its industry-standard Xeon processors, but IBM still controls the niche high-end server and mainframe market. Two years ago, IBM established the OpenPower Foundation, which shares the underlying technology (processor specifications, firmware, software) of its servers with partners. That ""open source"" strategy was aimed at widening the Power series' defensive moat against Intel's Xeon E-series processors and Oracle's SPARC chips -- which both target its high-end servers.Over the past few quarters, Intel has struggled with sluggish PC sales. During this time, the data center business has been a reliable pillar of growth, generating 13% sales growth and 11% operating income growth in the first nine months of 2015. Therefore, it makes perfect sense to team up with one of IBM's top rivals to gain ground in high-end servers as well.Why Oracle is teaming up with IntelAt first glance, it seems odd for Oracle to team up with Intel since Oracle's own SPARC chips compete against Intel's Xeons in high-end servers. But for now, both companies see IBM as a bigger problem. That's why Oracle has prioritized gaining market share in enterprise servers and software over the future of SPARC.During a recent presentation at Oracle World in San Francisco, Oracle CEO Mark Hurd declared that thousands of customers are still using ""large and costly"" IBM systems. Hurd claims that the Oracle-Intel architecture will likely offer faster performance than IBM's systems at a fraction of the cost.To prove that point, Oracle is providing qualifying Power System customers with a free, nondisruptive proof-of-concept migration to demonstrate the difference. In one such demonstration at a major insurance company, the Oracle-Intel system reportedly produced four to 12 times faster performance in certain apps and processes than a comparable IBM system. Hurd claims that these demos have already convinced ""thousands"" of customers to replace IBM systems with Oracle-Intel solutions. That might sound like a lot, but it likely accounts for a sliver of Oracle's 420,000 customers.What this all means for IBMIntel and Oracle's partnership comes at a time when IBM is reducing its dependence on hardware to focus on cloud services and software. A decade ago, it sold its PC business to Lenovo. Last year, it sold the aforementioned x86 server unit to Lenovo and handed off its unprofitable chipmaking unit to GlobalFoundries. All IBM has left in hardware today are Power-based servers, z Systems mainframes, and storage solutions.Last quarter, IBM's overall hardware revenues fell 39% annually and accounted for less than 8% of its top line. Power Systems revenues fell 3% and system storage revenues declined 19%, but z Systems mainframe revenue rose 15%. The growth in mainframe revenues was surprising since industry watchers had been predicting the death of fridge-sized mainframes for the past two decades.IBM'S Z13 MAINFRAME. SOURCE: IBM.A tough road aheadIBM CEO Ginni Rometty has repeatedly said that the company won't completely exit the hardware business. But wolves like Intel and Oracle are ready to devour what's left of IBM's hardware business and offer cheaper and faster alternatives. While that blow probably won't cripple IBM, it would make it harder for its revenues, which have already fallen for 14 consecutive quarters, to rise again.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Where Does IBM Rank in Software and Hardware?,"Jun 1, 2016 at 9:00AM","International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is a complicated company. IBM sells hardware, including mainframe systems, Power servers, and storage; it provides a vast array of IT services across the globe, and it sells billions of dollars' worth of software each year. About 80% of its revenue comes from clients that use multiple IBM products and services, with the company's strategy of providing integrated solutions the key to its exceptional profitability.There's no other company that does exactly what IBM does, and that makes comparing it to other technology companies difficult. IBM is worth more with all of its businesses working together rather than separately, a lesson learned during the company's near-death experience and subsequent turnaround in the early 1990s. But it can still be useful for investors to see exactly where IBM stacks up in certain areas.A software juggernautIMAGE SOURCE: IBM.During 2015, IBM generated $22.9 billion from software sales. Most of this revenue, about $19.5 billion, came from middleware, which is software that acts as the glue between other pieces of software. Another $1.8 billion came from operating systems, while the remaining $1.6 billion was derived from other products.If IBM's software segment were a stand-alone company, it would be the fourth-largest software company in the world. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reigns supreme, with Windows, Office, and its many other billion-dollar software businesses putting the company far in the lead. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is in second, with its database products continuing to generate outsized profits for the company. And SAP (NYSE:SAP), with its broad set of software products, is in third.CompanyFiscal 2015 RevenueFiscal 2015 Operating ProfitMicrosoft$93.6 billion30.1%Oracle$38.2 billion36.8%SAP$23.2 billion23.4%IBM Software$22.9 billion34.6%OPERATING PROFIT FIGURES EXCLUDE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. DATA SOURCES: MICROSOFT, ORACLE, SAP, AND IBM.IBM's software sales have been declining in recent years. The impact of currency fluctuations is one reason, with IBM's total revenue growth in 2015 negatively impacted by 8 percentage points because of a strong U.S. dollar. Another factor is the company's shift toward offering software as a service, which tends to push revenue recognition into the future. At the end of 2015, IBM's as-a-service annual run rate, which includes software as well as cloud infrastructure, reached $4.5 billion.Despite the transition going on at IBM, the company's software business is still immensely profitable for the company.A major server vendorIMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Hardware represents a relatively small percentage of IBM's revenue, but it's still an important contributor to the company's success. Following the sale of its x86 server business in 2014, IBM's systems business is left with mainframes and Power servers.During the fourth quarter of 2015, IBM claimed the No. 3 spot in the global server market, according to IDC. HP Enterprise was the clear leader, followed by Dell, IBM, Lenovo, and networking giant Cisco.Company4Q 2015 Market ShareGrowth (YOY)HP Enterprise24.9%(2.1%)Dell16.7%5.3%IBM14.1%8.9%Lenovo7.4%3.7%Cisco6.1%20.6%DATA SOURCE: IDC. YOY = YEAR OVER YEAR.IBM posted strong server revenue growth during the quarter, driven by both its mainframe systems and its Power systems. Mainframe sales are highly cyclical, spiking when a new system is introduced and falling off rapidly after a few quarters, so IBM's share will fluctuate going forward. Mainframe sales declined during the first quarter of this year, following exactly this pattern.IBM is the only top-five server vendor that doesn't sell x86 servers. The company is instead working to make its POWER processors a viable alternative to x86 chips in the hyperscale data center market through the OpenPOWER Foundation, which includes about 150 other companies. Progress has been slow over the past few years, but momentum is starting to build. In April, Alphabet's Google announced it was developing a server architecture based on IBM's POWER processors, a move that could mark the beginning of the end of Intel's uncontested dominance in the data center.IBM is a lot more than a software and hardware company, especially considering the company's heavy investments in cloud computing. But comparing IBM's cloud business to those of other cloud computing giants is difficult. IBM doesn't break out infrastructure-as-a-service revenue explicitly, and neither does Microsoft or Google. This comparison wouldn't be all that relevant, though, since IBM's cloud computing strategy is far deeper than simply aiming to be a IaaS provider.IBM is a company in transition. Resources are being shifted toward high-growth areas like cloud computing and analytics, and legacy businesses with poor growth prospects are in decline. Still, IBM remains a major force in the software market, and its position in the hardware market could improve as the OpenPOWER initiative matures."
Why Does Warren Buffett Keep Buying IBM?,"May 29, 2016 at 1:00PM","Warren Buffett first bought shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) in 2011, building a position worth nearly $11 billion for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B). The stock has performed poorly since then, leading many to question Buffett's rare foray into the world of technology stocks. IBM has suffered 16 consecutive quarters of year-over-year revenue declines, and the company expects its earnings to slump this year.IBM DATA BY YCHARTS.Despite IBM's poor performance, Buffett has continued to add to Berkshire's stake in IBM. While a $1 billion stake in Apple initiated by one of Buffett's investment managers got most of the attention when Berkshire filed its latest quarterly report, the company also disclosed a small increase in its IBM position. With IBM struggling, why exactly is Buffett still so confident in the company?Why Buffett bought IBMIMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Buffett's original purchase of IBM came as quite a shock. The billionaire generally avoids buying technology stocks because future earnings are difficult to predict. In a 2011 interview on CNBC, Buffett pointed out that he didn't buy railroad companies for a long time, either. IBM's annual report that year changed his mind on the company.What did Buffett see in IBM? He described his decision-making process in the same interview: ""And then we went around to all of our companies to see how their IT departments functioned and why they made the decisions they made. And I just came away with a different view of the position that IBM holds within IT departments and why they hold it and the stickiness and a whole bunch of things.""The IT industry has changed over the past five years in a pretty dramatic way. Cloud computing has transitioned from a buzzword to a transformative force in the industry, and the rapid growth of Amazon's AWS and other cloud infrastructure providers has freed organizations from having no choice but to buy their own hardware.IBM doesn't enjoy the same reverence as it once did. The catch phrase ""Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM"" is a thing of the past. But IBM's purpose, to solve its clients' problems and help them succeed, hasn't changed. And its stickiness in the IT industry hasn't changed either.Roughly 80% of IBM's revenue comes from clients who use multiple IBM solutions. IBM's strategy has long been to provide integrated solutions, spanning hardware, software, and services, and this creates major switching costs for IBM's clients. This advantage would eventually disappear if IBM sat still, but the company has been evolving along with the industry, investing heavily in areas like cloud computing, analytics, and security.As a result, the makeup of the services that IBM provides is changing. Less hardware, more cloud is probably a pretty apt description. What isn't changing is the need for those services. Transitioning to and then managing a cloud-based infrastructure is not a trivial task. IT isn't made any simpler by cloud computing.The core thesis behind Buffett's investment in IBM -- the company's position and inertia in the IT industry -- remains largely intact. Buffett certainly believes that; otherwise he wouldn't be continuing to buy shares. Most of IBM's reported revenue declines over the past few years have been the result of currency exchange rates and divestitures of underperforming businesses. The company is still reporting lackluster results, but its performance is not nearly as bad as the headlines suggest.Even after four years of weak results, IBM still expects to generate around $12 billion of free cash flow this year. That's below the $15.2 billion generated in 2011, but it's roughly the same as a percentage of revenue. Given the companywide transformation, with billions of dollars of spending being shifted to high-growth areas, IBM's ability to largely maintain its profitability is a testament to the strength of the company's business model.Buffett's investment in IBM may look like a mistake on the surface, with the stock price down considerably over the past few years. But the reason why the billionaire bought the stock in the first place hasn't changed, and I think there's a very good chance that it works out well for Berkshire in the long run.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

A Close Look at IBM's Dividend Potential,"May 6, 2016 at 8:07AM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.For 100 consecutive years, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has paid shareholders a dividend, and for 21 consecutive years, the company has increased that dividend. The latest dividend increase came in April, boosting IBM's quarterly payout by 7.7% to $1.40 per share. It was a smaller increase than IBM investors have enjoyed in recent years, but given the company's ongoing transformation, which has put pressure on earnings, a smaller dividend hike shouldn't be too surprising.YearQuarterly Dividend Increase20167.7%201518.2%201415.8%201311.8%201213.3%DATA SOURCE: IBM.With IBM stock already offering an enticing 3.9% yield, and with the company suffering from a decline in profits, what kind of dividend growth should investors expect going forward? Let's dive in and find out.IBM's dividend potentialUnlike many large technology companies, IBM hasn't hoarded cash. The company generally spends most of its free cash flow each year on share buybacks and dividends. Acquisitions eat up quite a bit of capital as well, but the company's balance sheet has remained solid. At the end of the first quarter, IBM had $14.9 billion of cash and $18.8 billion of debt not related to its global financing business on the balance sheet.Free cash flow is ultimately what fuels dividend payments, and IBM remains a cash machine despite its long struggle to return to growth. In 2015, IBM generated $13.1 billion of free cash flow, and this year, the company expects to generate about $12 billion. Based on the current quarterly dividend and share count, IBM will shell out about $5.4 billion in dividends over the next year. That puts the payout ratio based on the company's projected free cash flow at 45%.There's room to grow the payout ratio, and IBM's ongoing share buyback program allows its total dividend payments to grow more slowly than the per-share dividend. IBM reduced its outstanding share count by 2.1% during 2015, in line with the company's goal of a 2%-3% annual reduction. IBM's share buyback activity slowed in 2015, with $4.6 billion spent on its own shares compared to over $10 billion spent in each of the previous four years. I'd expect a similar amount to be spent annually going forward.With IBM's earnings in decline, the company gave investors a smaller dividend increase than usual this year. Until IBM returns to growth, I'd expect these smaller increases to become the norm. Still, with a dividend yield of about 3.9% at the current stock price, high single-digit dividend growth is perfectly acceptable in my book.Bigger dividend increases likely won't return until the company has officially turned the corner on its transformation. IBM is investing heavily in growth areas like cloud computing, analytics, and security. Those business are producing robust growth, and they now account for around 35% of total revenue, but the company's legacy businesses are shrinking. Coupled with currency fluctuations, the net effect has been falling revenue and profits. IBM expects its non-GAAP earnings to be at least $13.50 per share in 2016, down from $14.92 per share last year.In the near-term, mid-to-high single-digit annual dividend increases seem likely. IBM could afford to raise the dividend more quickly, but I would expect a conservative approach given the ongoing profit declines. The return of faster dividend growth ultimately depends on when earnings growth returns, and that could still be a few years away. But even with slower dividend growth than the company has historically produced, IBM offers dividend investors a compelling opportunity. A 3.9% yield, far higher than many other large tech companies, along with a decades-long record of dividend increases, make IBM a great dividend stock."
"IBM May Never Catch Amazon in the Cloud, and That's OK","May 24, 2016 at 10:45AM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Cloud computing is synonymous with Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, and for good reason. The online retailer's cloud-computing segment is nearing a $10 billion annual revenue run rate, with double-digit growth showing no sign of slowing down. Companies large and small depend on AWS, and it's not hyperbole to say that Amazon has drastically altered the IT landscape.International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) also has a large cloud business. The company generated $10.2 billion in cloud revenue during 2015, but that number includes hardware, software, and services, making it incomparable to AWS. IBM's cloud-delivered-as-a-service reached a $5.4 billion annual run rate at the end of the first quarter, but since this is mostly comprised of software, it's also not comparable to AWS, which offers mostly infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS).SoftLayer, IBM's IaaS business, is dwarfed by AWS. The company has a goal of reaching $1 billion in IaaS revenue this year, but that would still make Amazon's cloud-computing business about 10 times larger. Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Sandler, who rates IBM stock a hold due to growth concerns, believes that IBM will never catch up with Amazon, or even Microsoft, in the cloud. In the public IaaS market, Sandler believes that IBM doesn't have a chance.IBM will almost certainly never be the largest IaaS provider, or even the second largest. But the company's cloud strategy, which focuses on delivering high-value software and services, as well as helping companies transition to the cloud, doesn't require IBM to be an IaaS leader.IBM's cloudScale is important in the IaaS market. Amazon, being so much larger than any of its competitors, can drive down prices for virtual machines and storage. IBM's SoftLayer doesn't try to compete with Amazon on price. Instead, it goes after enterprise customers, offering bare metal servers that provide higher performance at a higher cost.IBM's cloud strategy goes well beyond SoftLayer. Bluemix is the company's platform-as-a-service offering. PaaS adds another layer of abstraction, allowing developers to avoid managing virtual machines and storage directly. Instead, developers focus on building their applications, with the underlying infrastructure required to run those applications handled by the platform.Through Bluemix, which is powered by SoftLayer, IBM offers a wide variety of services. Over a dozen different APIs that utilize Watson, the company's cognitive computing system, are available to developers, allowing for the easy integration of features like speech-to-text and image recognition. Data analytics, security, and a wide range of other services are also available to developers, including third-party services offered by other companies.These services, many unique to IBM, are the key to the company's cloud strategy. IaaS seems more like a means to an end for IBM, facilitating the delivery of high-value services through the cloud. Bluemix can also be used in a hybrid cloud or private cloud environment, giving large organizations with complex IT systems far more control compared to moving entirely to a public cloud like AWS.Beyond its cloud platform, IBM's services business is also shifting more heavily toward the cloud. The company is becoming more of a services integrator rather than a systems integrator, said CFO Martin Schroeter during IBM's latest earnings conference call. The cloud hasn't really made IT any simpler, and IBM will continue to play a major role helping organizations with their IT needs.While Amazon focuses on being the low-cost provider of IaaS services, IBM is going after the highest-value portions of the cloud computing market. The company's cloud strategy is summed up well by what CEO Virginia Rometty said during a conference last year:What's important is that we grow in the right areas. Tech is littered with areas that you can have high growth and make no money. That's not us.IBM will never be the largest cloud-computing company in the world. And that's just fine."
Better Buy: Microsoft Corporation vs. IBM,"May 11, 2016 at 8:40AM","In the not-too-distant past, both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) were sitting pretty. Microsoft, with its mighty Windows and Office businesses, seemed almost unassailable. And IBM's strategy of selling integrated solutions involving hardware, software, and services created high switching costs for customers, making it difficult for them to move away from Big Blue.Things have changed dramatically in only a few short years. Microsoft, blindsided by the rapid growth of mobile devices as well as the shift to cloud computing, required a new strategy from a new CEO. The company has since embraced the cloud, shifting to a software-as-a-service model for Office and investing heavily in its Azure cloud computing platform. While revenue has still been growing, Microsoft's profits have slumped. Free cash flow of $23.1 billion in fiscal 2015 was down more than 20% compared with 2012.IBM is also facing major challenges. The company was late to cloud computing, and while heavy investments will help it catch up, many of its legacy businesses are in decline. Fast-growing areas like analytics and security are being offset by weakness elsewhere, and the net result has been falling revenue and profit. IBM generated $12.9 billion of free cash flow in 2015, down 13% from $14.9 billion in 2012.Both Microsoft and IBM now appear to be on the right track, making the necessary investments to drive growth in the future. But which iconic tech giant is the better buy for investors?The case for MicrosoftIMAGE SOURCE: MICROSOFT.Under CEO Satya Nadella, who took the helm in 2014, Microsoft has made some major changes. Platforms other than Windows, which were formerly neglected or completely ignored, began to be treated as first class citizens. Office apps came to the iPhone, iPad, and Android devices, along with other Microsoft software like Outlook, OneDrive, and Skype. Microsoft realized that it needed its software to be on all devices that people used, not just PCs.Office 365, the software-as-a-service version of Office, has been growing fast, with 22.2 million consumer subscribers. On the enterprise side, the company's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure as well as server products, has reached a $10 billion annual run rate. Windows 10, which was given away for free to consumers as an upgrade, has reached an install base of 300 million. Microsoft hopes that a massive number of users will give developers a reason to create apps for Windows 10 PCs and mobile devices.Microsoft has some weak spots, too. Windows OEM revenue is in decline, thanks to both the free upgrade offer and the slumping PC market. And the company's smart phone business is a disaster, with Microsoft writing down $7.6 billion last year from its acquisition of Nokia's phone operations. Microsoft hasn't been able to carve out a spot for Windows mobile devices, leaving the company with a negligible market share.In terms of valuation, Microsoft stock isn't particularly inexpensive. Backing out the net cash on the balance sheet, Microsoft's cash-adjusted P/E ratio based on analyst estimates for this fiscal year is about 16. Microsoft is by no means a bargain at this price, especially considering the trouble the company is having growing earnings. However, the strategy that Microsoft now has in place looks like the right one, and in the long run I expect the company will do just fine. I'd wait for a lower price, though.The case for IBMIMAGE SOURCE: IBM.IBM has deeper problems than Microsoft. The company has reported year-over-year revenue declines for 16 straight quarters, and its earnings are still declining. The company expects to report non-GAAP EPS of at least $13.50 this year, down from $14.92 in 2015.IBM is undertaking a fairly dramatic transformation, shifting resources toward high-growth areas and away from shrinking legacy businesses. The company's strategic imperatives, which include cloud, analytics, security, social, and mobile, grew revenue by 26% on an adjusted basis in 2015, and the business now account for about 35% of the company's total revenue.Unfortunately, the rest of the business is performing poorly, and currency fluctuations have had a severe negative affect on IBM's global business. The net result has been what appears to be abysmal revenue declines; during 2015, revenue as reported slumped 12%. However, adjusted for currency and divestitures, revenue fell by just 1%, far from a disastrous outcome.IBM is making a lot of long-term bets, with one of the biggest being healthcare. The company has made a few acquisitions in the space, and its Watson Health unit has partnered with a variety of healthcare organizations and companies. Watson, IBM's cognitive computing system, is being used to analyze structured and unstructured medical data in an effort to aid healthcare professionals and provide personalized care to patients. The efforts will take a while to pay off, and there's no guarantee that they ever will, but healthcare is potentially a multibillion-dollar opportunity for IBM.IBM stock trades at just 11 times the company's earnings guidance, and a 3.8% dividend yield pays investors to wait for the company to complete its transformation. There's a chance that IBM's transformation fails, leaving the company's profits permanently lower. But I think IBM's valuation more than accounts for that risk.While investing in IBM takes a particularly patient investor, IBM stock offers better value than Microsoft stock, making Big Blue the better buy."
IBM and Cisco Have the Same Security Strategy,"May 4, 2016 at 3:00PM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Information security was a $75 billion market in 2015, and demand is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years as cyber attacks become more common and more expensive to deal with. The Wall Street Journal estimated that cybercrime costs in the U.S. totaled $100 billion in 2013, and British insurance company Lloyd's put the global figure at $400 billion in 2015. Juniper Research expects global cybercrime costs to balloon to over $2 trillion by 2019.Demand for cyber security products and services is expected to grow to $170 billion by 2020, according to a report from MarketsandMarkets, fueled by the growing threat of cybercrime. Given this growth, buying shares of fast-growing cyber security companies may seem like a no-brainer. In fact, there's an exchange traded fund, PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF (NYSEMKT:HACK), that allows investors to do just that.Unfortunately, this strategy has been disastrous for investors. HACK is down about 30% from highs reached about a year ago, driven by former high-flying stocks like FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) collapsing because of unrealistic expectations. FireEye, while posting rapid growth, is wildly unprofitable, and the stock has lost nearly 70% of its value since June of 2015.  Both International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) are major players in the cyber security market. Security represents a small portion of IBM's and Cisco's revenues, but both companies expect their respective security businesses to grow rapidly in the coming years. Neither company offers the same growth potential as smaller, pure-play companies like FireEye, but the strategy both IBM and Cisco are employing give the tech behemoths a good chance of becoming dominant industry leaders in the long run.A fragmented marketWhen a market is growing as quickly as the cyber security market, a large number of companies can be successful. As the market matures, though, consolidation becomes inevitable as the weaker players struggle to effectively compete. Last year, Cisco estimated that the typical large enterprise deals with more than 54 different security vendors. IBM put the number at 40 during its first-quarter conference call, but either way, working with dozens of separate vendors is inefficient, and it raises the likelihood that something goes wrong.Cisco, still predominantly a hardware company, competes in the security infrastructure market in addition to offering security software and services. In fiscal 2015, Cisco's security business generated $1.75 billion in revenue and posted 12% growth. Over the next 3-5 years, the company expects security revenue to grow at a 10%-15% annual rate.IBM's security business is roughly the same size, generating $2 billion of revenue in 2015 and growing by 12% adjusted for currency. Security is one of IBM's strategic imperatives, along with analytics, cloud, mobile, and social. The company is investing heavily in these areas, shifting resources away from shrinking legacy businesses in an effort to return to growth.Both Cisco and IBM have the same idea: Broaden their respective security businesses through acquisitions. This strategy allows both companies to offer an increasing variety of security products, potentially cutting down on the number of different vendors a typical organization depends on. There's certainly an incentive for organizations to simplify and deal with fewer vendors, and both Cisco and IBM are aiming to emerge as diversified leaders in the industry.Cisco has been actively acquiring security companies over the past few years, starting with the $2.7 billion purchase of Sourcefire in 2013. Acquisitions of ThreatGRID, OpenDNS, and Lancope followed, helping Cisco accelerate the growth of its security business. The company is shifting more heavily toward software and services with these acquisitions, and its security-deferred revenue jumped 26% year over year during Cisco's second quarter.IBM has also been buying up security companies, including Trusteer in 2013, Lighthouse Security Group in 2014, and Resilient Systems earlier this year. IBM now employs more than 7,000 security experts, and the company claims to lead the market in four out of its six security segments. IBM's business model has long been built around providing integrated solutions, and its security business is no different.While a large number of specialized cyber security companies are currently scrambling for market share, consolidation in the industry is inevitable. Both Cisco and IBM enjoy existing customer bases that give the companies a major advantage, and both have the resources to grow by acquisition. Betting on smaller companies like FireEye may seem more attractive to growth investors, but Cisco and IBM will be tough to beat."
Better Buy: Intel Corp. vs. IBM,"Apr 26, 2016 at 10:49AM","With the market as a whole relatively flat over the last year, shares of both IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have struggled to keep pace with the major indexes.INTC DATA BY YCHARTS.Both companies are currently weathering generational shifts in their respective businesses. For Intel, the semiconductor stalwart badly missed the rise of the mobile processor, while IBM reacted slowly to the rise of cloud computing. Considering both firm continues to play catchup with their respective industries' overall evolution, a highly justifiable debate is currently unfolding, asking if both companies are value stocks or value traps today.Which is currently the better buy: Intel or IBM?SOURCE: INTEL.Intel muddles alongThe world's largest semiconductor company's earnings last week was a mixed bag. Its reported revenue of $13.8 billion matched analysts' average expectations, and earnings per share of $0.54 were well ahead of the $0.47 expected by Wall Street. At the same time, Intel reduced its full-year guidance slightly, saying it expected sales to grow in the ""mid-single digits,"" slightly softer than its prior forecast of growth in the ""mid-to-high single digits."" Intel also announced layoffs that will affect roughly 11% of the company's workforce, totaling some 12,000 jobs. Implementation is expected to last through 2017, and Intel believes the efforts will reduce its expenses by $750 million in 2016, and $1.4 billion annually from 2017 onward.Overall, the company's transition continues from its profit-printing PC-dependent semiconductor business to one more diversified around growth businesses including data centers, and increasingly, mobile devices. Though the company has considerable room to improve its business, especially in mobile processors, 40% of Intel's sales, and 60% of its profits, now come from non-PC business lines. SOURCE: IBMIBM's unpleasant milestoneWhile Intel's recent earnings carried a mix of good and bad, the same can't be said for IBM. As much as I hate to say it, IBM's results were pretty ugly across the board.After seeing its sales contract 5% in Q1, IBM's streak of consecutive year-over-year revenue declines has reached the four-year mark. Sales declined across all five of the company's reporting segments, with gross margins contracting slightly in four of its five divisions. Non-GAAP earnings per share fell 19% versus the same quarter last year. It wasn't all doom and gloom, though; just mostly.IBM saw continued growth in what the company has dubbed its ""Strategic Imperatives"" businesses, which include platforms for cloud computing, big data analytics, mobile, and security. All told, these businesses, which IBM hopes will form the bedrock for the next generation of its operations, grew 17% on a constant-currency basis.However, this next generation of IBM's financial drivers has only accounted for 37% of the company's total sales during the past 12 months. So while this progress is much needed, it remains a far cry from being large enough to fully support IBM's current cost structure.Intel by a hair?Here's where things get slightly interesting. Though facing plenty of issues in mobile, Intel likely edges out IBM in terms of the current strategic positioning of its business pivot. Neither company could be said to enjoy the enviable industrywide dominance of their yesteryears, but Intel appears farther along than IBM in bridging the gap between its industry's present and future.Otherwise, IBM and Intel look eerily similar on paper. Both are mature technology companies that count themselves among the blue chip, old boys club that is the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Speaking to their currently precarious business conditions, both IBM and Intel trade at rock-bottom earnings multiples and high dividend yields. If you didn't know any better, you could easily mistake one's stock sheet for the other's.  IBM Intel P/E Ratio11.3x13.6xDividend Yield3.5%3.3%SOURCE: GOOGLE FINANCE.What's more, both companies have proven to be steady dividend stocks for tech investors interested in adding safe, income-generating assets to their portfolios.At the end of the day, Intel's current earnings paint the company in a reasonably better position than IBM. However, looking beyond the quarter-to-quarter noise, both companies are attempting to pivot their business models after badly missing the recent secular shifts in semiconductors and enterprise IT.Both companies have their strengths (valuation) and weaknesses (future uncertainty), and investors considering adding them to their portfolios absolutely need to weigh these countervailing factors before investing in either name.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why IBM and Oracle Plunged in 2015 While Microsoft Soared 19% Higher,"Jan 16, 2016 at 3:05PM","What: Enterprise software companies were not an easy ticket to great returns in 2015. Shares of IBM (NYSE:IBM) fell 14.2% last year, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) investors suffered an 18.8% negative return. But that's not to say that the entire sector had a tough year: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares soared 19.4% higher.So what: These three companies have more in common than just a few shared end markets. All three are also working under relatively new CEOs, starting with IBM's Ginni Rometty taking the helm at the start of 2012. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took Steve Ballmer's corner office in early 2014, and co-CEOs Mark Hurd and Safra Catz shouldered Larry Ellison's fallen cape and scepter seven months later at Oracle.We're also looking at three turnaround stories in the middle of their narratives.IBM DATA BY YCHARTS.Rometty's IBM is becoming a very different beast than the one-stop-shopping giant she took over from Sam Palmisano. The new IBM is shedding low-margin hardware businesses by the boatload to focus on more lucrative support services and the upcoming Internet of Things revolution. This wholesale makeover has led IBM to some tough crossroads, sacrificing easy sales in the short term, while building a stronger platform for the next couple of decades.ORCL DATA BY YCHARTS.Oracle is trying to lean less heavily on its namesake database system, which is in danger of being replaced by modern NoSQL platforms like Apache Cassandra and MongoDB. Both of these systems are developed and supported by open-source communities, making it hard for Oracle to compete on price and transparency. Instead, Oracle is digging deeper into cloud-computing services.Formerly known as ""The Information company,"" Oracle's official slogan now speaks of ""Integrated Cloud Applications and Platform Services."" Cloud-related sales still only represent 4% of Oracle's annual sales, leaving a lot of room for future growth. But the ambition is there, and that division is growing quickly. Still, Oracle's profit margins and free cash flows are suffering while the company goes through this necessary, but painful, transformation.MSFT DATA BY YCHARTS.Ending on a positive note, we're left with Redmond's finest. Under Nadella, Microsoft has embraced many strategies that would have been unthinkable under Ballmer, and with good results. Despite a flagging PC market and a dead-end entry into the mobile market, Microsoft has found a way back to earnings growth and stabilizing revenues.Like Oracle, the company is betting heavily on cloud computing. Unlike the database giant, Microsoft has found a big winner in its Windows Azure cloud-computing platform, which is an almost unchallenged No. 2 in that fast-growing market. Oracle is not even on the radar yet. So Microsoft is getting results from Nadella's new strategy already, giving investors a strong return in 2015.Now what: Looking ahead, these three stocks should appeal to very different investor types.Microsoft is currently supported by solid proof that its turnaround is going somewhere. But the stock has already started soaring as a result, and now trades at 35 times trailing earnings, or 4.5 times sales. Nadella must continue to execute his strategy perfectly, or those lofty multiples could collapse again.At the other extreme, IBM still seems to stub a toe every time Rometty coughs. Nervous investors have lowered Big Blue's trailing P/E ratio to a minuscule 9.2, and the stock can be bought for 1.5 times trailing sales. The market is getting tired of waiting for tangible, positive results from IBM's new strategy. So this is a deep, deep value play.Rometty doesn't have to break new ground in order to reward investors -- it would be enough to simply deliver on the long-term promise she has been building during the last four years. This stock would still look affordable at twice the P/E ratio, but the trick is to actually deserve such a jump. In the meantime, IBM investors can enjoy a fantastic 4% dividend yield thanks to low share prices and a stubborn commitment to dividend growth.In the middle ground, Oracle trades at 17 times trailing earnings, and 3.8 times sales. The company still sports excellent margins, and its sales haven't plunged as deeply as Microsoft's or IBM's. So this is arguably the safest enterprise software bet today. But then you're not getting IBM's spring-loaded valuation discount, or Microsoft's proven winner in the exact cloud market that Oracle hopes to catch a ride on. Trade-offs, trade-offs -- and fewer game-changing risks to deal with.Three enterprise-software giants, three different trajectories in 2015, and three distinct investment theses. Take your pick."
IBM Scores Server Chip Coup at Google,"Apr 12, 2016 at 9:45AM","IMAGE SOURCE: GOOGLE.The server CPU market is currently dominated by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The company has a market share close to 100%, and for large cloud companies that are building out massive data centers, like Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, Intel has been the only viable option for years. During 2015, Intel's data center segment enjoyed an operating margin of 50.4%.Talk of ARM server chips has been around for years, but as I've been saying for quite some time, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) may be the biggest threat to Intel's server chip empire. IBM launched the OpenPOWER foundation in 2013 along with companies like Google in an effort to open up the POWER architecture and build an ecosystem around its chips. The initiative now has over 150 member companies, all working to make POWER a viable alternative to Intel.These efforts over the past few years appear to finally be paying off. On April 6, Google announced that it was co-developing an open server architecture based on IBM's upcoming POWER9 processors with fellow cloud computing company Rackspace. POWER is now completely supported across Google's toolchain, allowing Google's data centers to mix and match Intel's x86 and IBM's POWER processors.POWER9 isn't due until 2017, but Intel should certainly be concerned.What it means for IBMIMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Prior to OpenPOWER, the only way to get a POWER system was by buying it directly through IBM. This business model doesn't work well in a world where companies like Google are designing and building their own server hardware to meet specific needs. Given how uncompetitive chips from Advanced Micro Devices have been over the past few years, Intel's chips were the only viable option.OpenPOWER changed things, allowing third-party companies to sell POWER systems, as well as design and sell custom POWER chips. IBM's POWER8 processor included a technology called CAPI, which allows accelerators from OpenPOWER member companies like NVIDIA and Xilinx to directly access system memory, boosting performance compared to a typical setup. IBM and NVIDIA won a deal with the U.S. Department of Energy in 2014 to build two new supercomputers built around POWER9 chips and NVIDIA's next-gen GPUs. The win was no doubt due to the newfound openness of the POWER architecture, which allows NVIDIA's GPUs to accelerate workloads dramatically.IBM's POWER chips are best suited for big data applications that are highly parallel, so any market share that the company can win is limited to only the portion of the server CPU market where using POWER chips makes sense. IBM has stated that its goal is to capture 10% to 20% of the hyperscale data center and high-performance computing markets, up from basically zero today. Google's plan to design a POWER9 server architecture, and its push to support POWER processors across its toolchain, is the biggest step so far for the OpenPOWER initiative.What it means for IntelIMAGE SOURCE: INTEL.If something can't go on forever, it won't, to paraphrase the late Herbert Stein. Intel maintaining a near-monopoly of the server chip market seems very unlikely in the long run, given the enormous amount of money cloud companies like Google spend on server chips each year. There's a major incentive for an alternative to emerge, especially considering Intel's lush margins. IBM's OpenPOWER is a threat in the high-end portion of the market, while ARM server chips will eventually be a threat in the low-end portion of the market. AMD may even launch a respectable product with its upcoming Zen CPUs.With the PC market continuing to slump, and with Intel's mobile business still struggling, the data center segment has been a consistent source of growth for the company. But I seriously doubt that the ultra-high margins that Intel currently enjoys are sustainable. Intel has faced no serious competition in the server chip market for years, but that won't remain true for long.Google may, at least in part, be using the threat of adding POWER chips to its data centers as a bargaining chip to get lower prices from Intel. But this would have the same effect of pushing Intel's data center profitability down. Either way, I don't see how the bonanza in Intel's data center segment can go on for much longer. That's not to say that Intel's data center segment won't continue to generate hefty profits. But I suspect the segment's margins will eventually fall back to earth.OpenPOWER has been slowly building up momentum since its founding, and with Google now building a server architecture based on POWER9, and touting its desire to support different CPU architectures in its data centers, the initiative may be reaching critical mass. The days of having no option in the data center other than Intel look to be numbered.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Don't Worry About IBM's Mainframe Sales Collapse,"Apr 27, 2016 at 10:09AM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.For those who know little about International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), the company's hulking System Z mainframe computers may seem like little more than a relic. The 42% year-over-year decline in System Z sales during IBM's first quarter would appear to offer proof that the mainframe business is struggling.But investors shouldn't worry about this mainframe sales collapse. It's happened before, and it will happen again. IBM's System Z product cycle, which sees new models introduced every few years, induces an extreme amount of sales volatility as clients rush to upgrade. While IBM doesn't report System Z sales numbers directly, the company does report year-over-year performance, and that allows us to see that the big drop in sales during the first quarter is nothing out of the ordinary.The mainframe product cycleDespite the rise of hyperscale data centers and cloud computing, IBM's mainframe computers remain integral parts of many organizations' IT infrastructures. Visa, Wal-Mart, and Citigroup are a few examples of major corporations that continue to rely on IBM's mainframe systems. While expensive, mainframe systems are ultra-reliable, secure, and can provide meaningful cost savings for specific use cases. The z13 mainframe, launched in January 2015, can process 2.5 billion transactions each day, the equivalent of 100 Cyber Mondays, according to IBM.The launch of the z13 last year led to a spike in mainframe sales. During the first quarter of 2015, System Z sales jumped an astonishing 130% adjusted for currency, the largest year-over-year rise in more than a decade. Sales remained brisk for a few quarters, but a steep drop during the first quarter of this year has undone much of this growth.This is how the mainframe product cycle works: a major upgrade fuels demand as clients replace older machines, creating a few quarters of extremely strong sales. Once the initial rush is over, sales fall back to earth, only to rise again a few years later when IBM refreshes its lineup. This pattern is evident looking at the performance of the System Z business over the past decade.DATA FROM IBM QUARTERLY EARNINGS REPORTS AND PRESENTATIONS.In 2005 and 2006, the System z9 line of mainframes launched, propelling sales higher until the second half of 2007. The System z10 arrived in early 2008, again providing a revenue boost for a few quarters. In 2010, the first zEnterprise System launched, followed by a refresh in late 2012. In both cases, the same pattern of strong sales emerged. Lastly, the 2015 launch of the System z13 kept the trend going.While sales of mainframe systems represent a relatively small portion of IBM's total sales, once related hardware, software, and services are included, the mainframe accounts for a major part of IBM's profits. Back in 2012, an analyst from Bernstein Research estimated that the mainframe ultimately accounted for a quarter of IBM's revenue and nearly half of its profits. IBM's business has changed since then, with the company undergoing a transformation, but the mainframe remains a key part of IBM.The mainframe hasn't really been a growth business for IBM over the past decade, but the company has taken steps to position the systems as a viable alternative to data centers filled with x86 machines. System Z mainframes have been able to run Linux for more than a decade, but the LinuxONE, a variant supporting only Linux, was launched late last year in an effort to appeal to organizations running Linux-based systems, either on-premises or in the cloud. LinuxONE supports a long list of open source software, and it can be paid for with a pricing system based partly on usage, lowering the upfront cost of running a mainframe.Whether IBM will be able to significantly grow its mainframe business going forward is an open question. In the age of cloud computing, the systems certainly carry a stigma, viewed by many as outdated and obsolete. But the drop in mainframe sales during the first quarter is not a sign that those people are correct. Instead, it's a natural consequence of the mainframe product cycle. Investors have nothing to worry about."
What Warren Buffett Wants You to Know About IBM,"May 23, 2016 at 4:11PM","This article was updated on Oct. 18, 2016, and was originally published on May 23, 2016. Click here for a fresh look (Feb. 21, 2017) look at Buffett's holdings.Warren Buffett has traditionally been averse to investing in tech companies. However, The Oracle of Omaha made an exception by buying a big position in IBM (NYSE:IBM) in 2011. Buffett kept buying IBM over the next several years, and regulatory filings show that he added to the position in the first quarter of 2016. As of June 2016, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) owned 81.2 million shares of IBM, for a market value of nearly $12.2 billion. IBM stock, however, has languished since Buffett started investing in the company. Big Blue is down by almost 20% over the past five years, substantially underperforming the S&P 500 index and its gain of nearly 77% in the same period. Most investors would be quite disappointed with this return, but Buffett is nothing like the average investor. On the contrary, chances are that Buffett is quite thrilled with this lackluster performance from IBM.IMAGE SOURCE: MOTLEY FOOL.Listening to Warren BuffettIn Berkshire Hathaway's letter to shareholders for 2011, Buffett explained how capital allocation can be an enormously important return driver for investors. The best business managers are those who don't only make the right operating decisions but also allocate capital wisely. In fact, smart financial management is one of the main reasons Buffett invested in IBM in the first place. In his own words:Let's use IBM as an example. As all business observers know, CEOs Lou Gerstner and Sam Palmisano did a superb job in moving IBM from near-bankruptcy 20 years ago to its prominence today. Their operational accomplishments were truly extraordinary.But their financial management was equally brilliant, particularly in recent years as the company's financial flexibility improved. Indeed, I can think of no major company that has had better financial management, a skill that has materially increased the gains enjoyed by IBM shareholders. The company has used debt wisely, made value-adding acquisitions almost exclusively for cash, and aggressively repurchased its own stock.Buffett then explains that long-term investors in IBM would actually benefit if the stock price remains stagnant or even declines over the years.Today, IBM has 1.16 billion shares outstanding, of which we own about 63.9 million, or 5.5%. Naturally, what happens to the company's earnings over the next five years is of enormous importance to us. Beyond that, the company will likely spend $50 billion or so in those years to repurchase shares. Our quiz for the day: What should a long-term shareholder, such as Berkshire, cheer for during that period?I won't keep you in suspense. We should wish for IBM's stock price to languish throughout the five years.The logic is simple: If you are going to be a net buyer of stocks in the future, either directly with your own money or indirectly (through your ownership of a company that is repurchasing shares), you are hurt when stocks rise. You benefit when stocks swoon. Emotions, however, too often complicate the matter.Buffett is clearly on the buying side when it comes to IBM stock, so he has benefited from a declining stock price over the past several years -- both because of his direct purchases and by the fact that IBM has been able to repurchase more stock with the same amount of capital.The big question for investors in IBMThe following chart shows IBM's shares outstanding, net income, and earnings per share. The company has reduced the amount of shares outstanding by a huge 18% in the past five years. However, the fact that net income has substantially declined over that period is a big limitation in terms of earnings-per-share growth. For this reason, the main question for investors is whether IBM can jump-start earnings growth in the coming years.IBM SHARES OUTSTANDING DATA BY YCHARTSThe company is going through a transformation. IBM is moving away from low-margin businesses toward areas with higher room for growth and profitability, and this move is hurting revenue. Segments such as transaction processing software, consulting, integration software, and hardware have been quite weak over the past several years.However, IBM is aggressively investing in a group of business it has identified as ""strategic imperatives."" This group includes cloud, analytics, security, social, and mobile technologies. Performance from strategic imperatives has been quite promising lately, and management believes it can produce sustained growth from these segments over the years ahead. Sales from strategic imperatives grew 16% in the second quarter of 2016, and the segment accounted for 40% of IBM's total sales over the past 12 months. The cloud-computing business was particularly strong last quarter, with constant currency revenue growing 44%.The jury is still out as to what kind of performance IBM can sustain. However, chances are that strategic imperatives will account for a growing share of the business, and this could be a major positive in terms of sales and earnings growth. IBM has repurchased lots of shares at cheap prices over the past several years, and Buffett has also invested considerable amounts of fresh money in the company over this period. If IBM can jump-start growth, all those shares purchased at conveniently low prices could turn out to be tremendously profitable investments, both for IBM and for Warren Buffett."
"After Forking Out $110 Billion on Stock Buybacks, IBM Shifts Its Spending Focus","Apr 25, 2016 at 10:40AM","SOURCE: IBMIf there's a poster child for a myopic share repurchase plan, it has to be International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). The company has spent roughly $110 billion since 2000 on share buybacks, or nearly 80% of its current market capitalization. Investors haven't benefited from this aggressive buyback policy. Shares are only up about 30% over the past 16 years, trailing the greater S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial average by healthy margins during this period.While it's true IBM's spent approximately $90 billion on research and development during that period, the company's research and development expense as a percentage of revenue figure of approximately 6% is lower than North American Internet and Software companies figure of 12%-14%. Instead, IBM chose to spend the vast majority of its free cash flow (and borrowed funds) buying its shares in an attempt to prop up its earnings-per-share metric, which is the technology equivalent to eating your seed corn. In the beginning, CEO Ginni Rometty tried to fulfill predecessor Sam Palmisano's goal of $20 earnings per share by 2015. In 2014, after nearly three years of failure and debt-fueled stock buybacks, Rometty called off the $20-per-share target.There's nothing wrong with ambitious EPS figures, but IBM went about it the wrong way. As a result, the company was more concerned with divesting units and lowering per-share counts than growing its top line and the health in the business. As a result, IBM was caught flat-footed when companies shifted to cloud-based computing at the expense of on-site servers. Looking at IBM's first-quarter earnings report, it appears the company is rethinking its strategy.Increases in research and development decreases in share buybacksIn IBM's recent first-quarter report, the company repurchased $939 million in share repurchases. While that may seem like a large amount, it's actually a decrease of 19% from last year's corresponding quarter. However, this is a clear continuation from fiscal year 2015 – IBM repurchased $4.6 billion of its shares that year, which was down significantly from the $13.7 billion and $13.9 billion the company repurchased in 2014 and 2013, respectively.It appears the company has been allocating more money to research and development. In the first quarter, IBM spent $1.46 billion in R&D expenses, an increase of 12.3% over last year's corresponding quarter. Additionally, IBM's R&D as a percentage of revenue increased to 7.8% in the quarter. In both 2013 and 2014, IBM's R&D as a percentage of revenue was 5.8%. IBM's historically never spent a large part of its revenue on R&D, and that's a potential reason the company was unable to create new revenue to replace declining hardware sales.If you can't beat 'em, buy 'emThere's more than one way for IBM to bring new technologies to consumers. Many technology firms simply acquire high-interest technologies instead of spending the money on research and development. And IBM has been on a buying spree when it relates to cloud and big data services. After paying $2 billion for cloud-computing firm SoftLayer, IBM continued its cloud binge by buying Cloudant, Cleversafe, and Gravitant. Since 2013, the company has spent nearly $10 billion in acquisitions, most in next-gen technologies.IBM is in the midst of a business transition, and it's possible the company's new focus of buying cloud businesses and increasing research and development in big data analytics may be unsuccessful. However, this plan is better than the company's former prescripts of spending money to buy back shares in an attempt to prop up its share price in the hope investors ignore weakness in the company's business operations.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

A Deep Dive in Relative Valuation for Big Blue -- Is IBM Trading at a Bargain?,"Feb 21, 2016 at 11:00AM","Two camps traditionally exist when it comes to stock valuation: intrinsic vs. relative. Intrinsic valuation involves cash flow projections, estimated growth rates, and present value discounting. Relative valuation takes a different approach, determining the price of an asset by comparing it to the price of similar assets -- similar to the way a house is appraised.In the words of valuation guru and New York University Professor of Finance Aswath Damodaran:In discounted cash flow valuation [intrinsic], we assume that markets make mistakes, that they correct these mistakes over time, and that these mistakes can often occur across entire sectors or even the entire market. In relative valuation, we assume that while markets make mistakes on individual stocks, they are correct on average.Typically, collaboration does not take place between the two valuation methods as investors tend to stick to their preferred methodology. But at the crossroads of these two models stands opportunity in the form of corroborating, value evidence.For IBM(NYSE:IBM) stock, now trading at six year lows, let's dive into the relative valuation model to determine if this company is indeed undervalued.Relative valuation ratiosThe typical toolbox of relative valuation for stocks includes these ratios:Price-to-earnings (P/E)Price-to-book value (P/B)Price-to-sales (P/S)Price-to-cash flow (P/CF)The appeal of these ratios lies in their simplicity, as one can simply compare the ratio value of a company to historical levels, the industry, or an overall market average. IBM, for example, has a trailing 12 month P/E ratio of 8.3 compared to an industry average of 13.7 and an S&P 500 average of 18.1. Simplistically, it appears that IBM is undervalued, but as Damodaran warns us, these ratios come with caveats.A skewed P/EFor the market average P/E ratio, if a disproportionate number of them are either higher or lower, then the average P/E ratio will be skewed in either direction. For example, the trailing P/E for the S&P 500 is 18.1 and the median is 14.6. This is a fairly significant spread, precipitated by the higher valuations that skew the average. It is advisable to use the midpoint or median value for comparison purposes in order to eliminate some of the noise in the average.The dangers of historical P/ETypically, a historic P/E is used as a point of reference to judge whether the market or an individual stock is properly valued. IBM has a trailing P/E of 8.3 and a historic 10-year average of 12.7. According to Damodaran, using a historic P/E average can be ""fraught with danger"" as interest rates can be higher or lower than historical norms, which prevents an apples-to-apples comparison. If interest rates were higher in a previous period, they served as an ankle weight to corporate performance and subsequent earnings (and vice versa). Instead, Damodaran suggests coupling relative valuation ratios with companion variables in order to determine value.A relative solutionThe following table captures this methodology for tying relative valuation ratios to a companion variable in order to uncover indicators of undervaluation.Valuation mismatchesMultipleCompanion VariableMismatch Indicator for Undervalued CompanyTrailing P/E ratioExpected growth next 3 to 5 yearsLow P/E ratio with high expected growth rate in earningsP/BV ratioROE (10-year average)Low P/BV with high ROETrailing P/S ratioNet marginLow P/S ratio with high net profit marginSOURCE: THE LITTLE BOOK OF VALUATION BY ASWATH DAMODARANFor IBM, the trailing P/E ratio of 8.3 pairs with an expected five-year growth rate of 7.25%. We have already determined that this P/E ratio appears ""low"" -- now, we must determine whether a 7.25% earnings growth rate is ""high"". By historical standards, IBM grew earnings by a 9.2% average over the last 10 years, and the median earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 for the past 25 years is 12%. Thus, the earnings growth rate for IBM does not appear high, and the company fails this first test.The P/BV ratio for IBM is 8.8, and the company has averaged a 59.8% return on equity over the last 10 years. The median P/BV of the S&P 500 over the last 15 years has averaged 2.7, and the company itself has a five-year median of 9. Although IBM has a stratospheric ROE, the company fails this test based on its price-to-book value, which appears high compared to the S&P median and in-line with the company's historic levels.Last but not least, IBM trades at 1.4 times sales, and the company's most recent quarterly net margin was 20.2%. Comparatively, the median P/S for the S&P 500 over the past 14 years has been 1.4, and the company itself has a median of 1.75 over the last ten years. The median net margin for IBM over the same period has been 13.5%, and the most recent quarterly net margin for the IT services industry is 22.1%. It can be argued that IBM passes this test but just barely.Summarily, IBM has failed two out of three of our companion variable tests and barely met the third. One would have to conclude from this analysis that IBM does not appear undervalued. Keep in mind, however, that this is merely a slice of relative valuation (a slice of a slice), and the prudent investor will develop an intrinsic valuation model in order to corroborate this takeaway.Intrinsic value according to Buffett and WilliamsRelative valuation includes a handful of simple tools that can be used for valuation, but investors should not be lulled into their simplicity and overlook their nuances: P/E ratio averages can be skewed by uneven distributions, and historic ratios are influenced by interest rate environments.  The solution is to use median values and to couple these ratios with companion variables in order to seek out undervalued companies. In completing this exercise for IBM, we do not find such indicators, but as Warren Buffett iterated in his 1992 letter to shareholders, the true intrinsic value of a productive asset was set forth by John Burr Williams over 50 years ago.The value of any stock, bond, or business today is determined by the cash inflows and outflows -- discounted at an appropriate interest rate -- that can be expected to occur during the remaining life of the asset.Relative valuation ratios should be used to supplement but not to supplant the true determination of value for productive assets as found in intrinsic value models.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

5 Must-Read Quotes From IBM's Management,"Apr 20, 2016 at 1:34PM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) managed to handily beat analyst estimates when it reported its first-quarter earnings, but there was some messiness in the company's results. Major restructuring charges and a big tax benefit clouded the company's profitability, and another revenue decline, the 16th in a row, showed that the turnaround is far from over.The numbers that IBM reported only tell part of the story. Here are five quotes from IBM CFO Martin Schroeter, taken from the conference call transcript provided by Thomson Reuters, that investors need to see.About those layoffsIBM has been reportedly cutting quite a few jobs in recent months, and nothing drives pessimism about a company more than major layoffs. But IBM has also been adding to its workforce, partly through acquisitions. As the company invests heavily in new areas and as legacy businesses shrink, the makeup of IBM's workforce is changing rapidly. Schroeter explains:As we transform our business and move into new areas, we need to transform our workforce, not only the types of skills but how we operate. This quarter, we took significant actions to transform our workforce and shift our skills base to new areas and to improve our structure primarily outside the US. This resulted in a pre-tax charge of just under $1.5 billion. It's important to recognize that these actions are impacting our profit and margins this quarter while improving our position for the future.IBM's operating expenses were boosted by $1.5 billion during the first quarter due to charges related to this workforce transformation, along with a few other items, but this isn't a simple case of a company laying people off. IBM added 70,000 people to its workforce in 2015, and lost slightly more than that number due to layoffs, retirement, and divestitures. In recent months, IBM announced a few major acquisitions, including Truven Health Analytics, Bluewolf Group, and Ustream. These new employees are replacing those in areas of the business that IBM is shifting away from.These moves will save the company some money, according to Schroeter, but the main goal is to rebalance skills, not cost reduction. And any money saved will be reinvested into IBM's fast-growing strategic imperatives.Watson is getting biggerOne of the more visible products that IBM has launched in recent years is Watson, the company's cognitive computing system that burst onto the scene by winning Jeopardy! back in 2011. The system is now being used in many different industries, and the Watson business is growing fast, according to Schroeter:We're continuing to expand our Watson ecosystem and reach. Over the last 12 months, the number of developers using Watson APIs is up over 300%, and the number of enterprises we've engaged with has doubled. Watson solutions are being built, used, and deployed in more than 45 countries and across 20 different industries.Unfortunately, IBM didn't break out specific numbers for Watson. Watson is included in the new cognitive solutions segment, which posted just 0.4% revenue growth during the first quarter, adjusted for currency. This segment includes transaction processing software, which is not a growth business, but at this point, Watson is likely still too small to move the needle. The segment generated $4 billion of revenue during the first quarter.Watson, being a machine learning system, requires training in order to be used for any specific application, and this process can take years. Many of the partnerships IBM has forged over the past few years involving Watson may only be beginning to bear fruit. At some point over the next couple of years, IBM will need to disclose the size of the Watson business, as it is a cornerstone of the company's strategy.OpenPOWER makes progressIBM's Power systems business has been in decline for years as x86 processors, mostly from Intel, have monopolized the data center. IBM started the OpenPOWER foundation in 2013, along with companies like Alphabet's Google and NVIDIA, with a goal of opening up the company's POWER architecture and building an ecosystem around POWER chips. That effort made progress during the first quarter:We recently signed a deal with a large enterprise in China that is dramatically growing its Linux server footprint and has chosen Linux on power partly because they can do it with half of the footprint they would have required with X86. The relationship will lead to the installation of thousands of Linux on power systems. We also continued to see good traction with the OpenPOWER foundation based innovations which will ultimately drive adoption of the power platform and provide intellectual property income. Just a few weeks ago, Google, a founding member of the OpenPOWER foundation, announced that it is working with Rackspace, an Open Compute Project founding member, to co-develop an open server specification based around IBM's new POWER9 architecture.IBM has allowed third-party companies to sell POWER-based systems, and even to design custom POWER chips, a move that makes it an attractive option in China, where the government is pushing to lower its dependence on foreign technology products. On the home front, Google recently announced that it was developing a server architecture based on the upcoming POWER9 chip, a move that could see Intel's dominance in the data center diminished.Strategic imperativesIBM's turnaround strategy revolves around high-growth businesses called strategic imperatives. These include analytics, cloud, mobile, social, and security, and they're currently growing at a double-digit rate, partially offsetting declines in other parts of the business:So now over the last 12 months, strategic imperatives delivered $30 billion in revenue, which represents 37% of our total revenue; that's two points ahead of where we were 90 days ago. In the quarter, our total cloud revenue grew 36% to $2.6 billion with the as-a-service components growing 46%. Our annual run rate for the as-a-service revenue is now $5.4 billion. Our analytics revenue grew 9% on a large base. You'll recall it was an $18 billion business for us last year. And mobile and security each posted strong double-digit growth.IBM's total cloud revenue includes hardware, software, and services related to public, private, and hybrid clouds, so it's not directly comparable to results from other cloud computing providers like Amazon's AWS. The growth of IBM's as-a-service cloud revenue, which includes IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, is in part due to acquisitions, but a $5.4 billion annual run rate is an impressive number given that IBM was late to embrace cloud computing. All of IBM's relevant software is now offered through the cloud, and the company continues to invest in both its SoftLayer and Bluemix cloud platforms.Software performance is improvingDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, software sales plunged 11% year over year, and were down 6% adjusted for currency. With software being the highest margin portion of IBM, this decline was concerning. While software is no longer its own segment, instead split between IBM's new reporting segments, the company did provide an update on software sales:So now let me come back to the performance of software across our segments. Our total software revenue was down less than 1%. This is a significant improvement from our performance last quarter, which was down 6%. We got the improvement we expected from the higher mix of annuity versus transactional content in the first quarter. In addition, we've been adding a lot of new capabilities, both organically and through acquisitions, and this quarter software growth reflected the acquisitions which closed over the last year. These acquisitions contribute revenue growth but impact our profit performance in the first year.Overall, software sales fell by just 1% adjusted for currency, a major improvement compared to the fourth quarter. Transactional processing software sales slumped 5%, while cognitive solutions software, the biggest category, grew by 3%. Meanwhile, integration software sales fell 2%, while operating systems software sales declined by 7%.Acquisitions drove some of this improvement, and IBM's software portfolio is still very much in flux as the company continues its transformation. The good news is that the strategic imperatives are more software-heavy compared to the rest of the business, and with software carrying higher margins than hardware or services, this mix shift could drive profit growth in the long run.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Will 2016 Be International Business Machines Corporation's Best Year Yet?,"Jan 2, 2016 at 7:03PM","It's no secret that International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has had a rough 2015. Revenue has now declined on a year-over-year basis for 14 quarters in a row, with a 14% drop during the third quarter of 2015, and the company's expected earnings for the year are well below its previously abandoned target of $20 per share. The stock has slumped in 2015, following a similar slump in 2014.IBM DATA BY YCHARTS.Despite the pessimism surrounding IBM, the company is making progress on transitioning its business. IBM's strategic imperatives, which include its cloud and analytics businesses, are growing at double-digit rates, and the company has poured resources into long-term growth opportunities like Watson and the Internet of Things. While 2016 is unlikely to be IBM's best year ever, it has a good chance of being better than 2015.The currency situationIBM has reported a double-digit year-over-year revenue decline in each of the past four quarters, a situation that looks absolutely awful on the surface. However, there are two factors that are negatively affecting IBM's reported revenue that have little to do with the business itself. First, IBM sold off a few businesses in 2014, meaning that a portion of these declines are simply due to the loss of divested revenue.Second, the U.S. dollar has gotten stronger relative to other currencies, meaning that revenue earned in foreign currencies translate into fewer dollars. On an adjusted basis, IBM's revenue declined by just 1% year over year during the latest quarter, hardly a disaster for a company actively transforming its business. Here's how the euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate has changed over the past few years:EURO TO US DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE DATA BY YCHARTS.As IBM enters 2016, the company will lap the big decline in exchange rates that occurred during 2014 and the beginning of 2015. Exchange rates could fall further, of course, but if rates remain roughly flat, revenue declines should become much smaller. The company is still facing challenges, but at least the headline numbers should look a lot better in 2016.Strategic imperativesIBM's strategy boils down to shifting toward high-value products and services, where the company can gain a competitive advantage. IBM has no interest in being the biggest infrastructure-as-a-service provider, for example, and although the company does sell IaaS services through SoftLayer, the focus is on providing industry-leading performance, not maximizing market share.During the third quarter of 2015, strategic imperative revenue grew by 27% year over year on an adjusted basis. Cloud revenue grew by 65%, with total cloud revenue reaching $9.4 billion over the trailing-12-month period. IBM expects strategic imperatives to generate $40 billion of revenue by 2018, up from $25 billion in 2014.This strong growth has yet to offset declines elsewhere, even on an adjusted basis, and it's hard to say whether that will change in 2016. Many of IBM's initiatives, like cognitive computing system Watson, are long-term efforts, and it may take years for them to fully pay off. CEO Ginni Rometty is aiming for Watson to grow into a $10 billion business within 10 years, but because the system needs to be trained on massive amounts of data for each application, progress in turning Watson into a major source of revenue has been slow.IBM has made a big push to use Watson in the healthcare industry, partnering with a variety of healthcare organizations in an effort to improve patient outcomes and provide personalized treatment options. This is exactly the type of initiative that will take years to pay off, if it ever does, but if IBM succeeds, it's not hard to imagine the company generating billions of dollars in revenue from the healthcare industry alone.2016: Better but not greatIf the U.S. dollar doesn't continue to strengthen in 2016, IBM's revenue declines should shrink dramatically. This has little to do with the business itself, but at least the company's performance would appear to have improved to those who don't look beyond the headlines.Even on an adjusted basis, IBM's revenue is still declining, and I wouldn't expect a huge improvement in 2016. IBM launched a new mainframe in 2015, and without a new launch in 2016, mainframe revenue should start to decline, weighing on IBM's results. However, continued growth of IBM's strategic imperatives should eventually counteract declines elsewhere. Whether this ultimately occurs in 2016 is an open question.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Do IBM's Share Buybacks Make Sense?,"May 17, 2016 at 3:17PM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been a prolific buyer of its own shares. The company has reduced its outstanding share count by about 37% over the past decade, and in the past five years alone, Big Blue has poured $59 billion into share buybacks. The stock has risen about 80% over the past 10 years, but it's down considerably from highs reached in 2013.IBM DATA BY YCHARTS.IBM's heavy buyback activity in the past five years hasn't helped the stock, but that doesn't necessarily mean the company made a mistake. The short-term performance of a stock should not act as a litmus test for whether a past buyback was reasonable. Instead, investors should ask whether the buyback made sense at the time.Billions down the drain?IBM spent over $10 billion on share buybacks annually from 2011 through 2014, a staggering sum, to be sure. The slump in the stock price over the past few years would suggest that this money was wasted. But the purpose of share buybacks shouldn't be to boost the stock price, despite many companies buying their own shares for exactly that reason. The purpose is to deploy capital in a way that generates the best possible rate of return.IBM generates a tremendous amount of free cash flow, so much that it can't possibly invest it all back into the business at a reasonable rate of return. In 2011, for example, the company reported about $15.2 billion of free cash flow. That was after spending $4.1 billion on capital expenditures and $6.3 billion on research and development. Even backing out the $1.8 billion IBM spent on acquisitions that year, the company still generated around $13.4 billion in excess free cash flow.Now, one could argue that the company should have ramped up R&D spending, or that more acquisitions should have been made to drive growth. But IBM has generally been able to avoid making genuinely bad acquisitions in recent years. Think Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia's phone operations, which led to a $7.6 billion writedown. Or Hewlett-Packard's acquisition of Autonomy, which led to an $8.8 billion writedown. IBM usually opts for smaller acquisitions with the goal of building out its product offerings, instead of transformational acquisitions that often end with a big write-off.Having billions of dollars left over each year isn't enough to ensure that using that cash for buybacks makes sense. The price of the stock has to be reasonable -- otherwise, the rate of return would be poor. Graphics chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers a good example of a share buyback program gone wrong. NVIDIA's stock has soared in recent years, pushing its valuation to inflated levels, but the company continues to pour money into its own shares. I estimated in a recent article that NVIDIA's $500 million share buyback program would generate an equivalent pre-tax return on investment of less than 4%. NVIDIA's buybacks are almost certainly going to destroy shareholder value, not create it.Even when IBM's stock was hitting new highs in 2013, the company never paid an unreasonable price for its own shares. The highest P/E ratio IBM stock managed at the time was around 16.5, certainly not an obvious bargain, but also not obviously overpriced. NVIDIA, in contrast, currently trades for nearly 40 times last year's earnings.IBM P/E RATIO (ANNUAL) DATA BY YCHARTS.IBM's per-share operating income was 31% higher in 2015 than it would have been if the company's share count had remained flat since the start of 2011. If the $59 billion that was spent on buybacks during that time was instead invested back into the company, IBM would have needed to generate an 8.2% pre-tax return on investment in order to match the boost provided by buybacks. Since there's no way IBM could possibly invest that much excess cash and get a reasonable rate of return, buybacks were an attractive option.Buybacks should continueThe best time for a company to buy its own shares is when the stock is depressed. IBM has suffered from falling revenue and profits over the past few years, and the stock now trades for just 11 times expected 2016 earnings of $13.50 per share. However, a significant component driving this decline has been currency. In 2015, while IBM reported a 12% decline in revenue, sales slumped by just 1% adjusting for currency and divestitures. IBM estimated during its fourth-quarter conference call that 2016 pre-tax profits would be reduced by $1.3 billion because of currency issues alone.Another factor is IBM's ongoing transformation. Growth businesses like analytics and cloud computing aren't quite offsetting declines in legacy businesses, and that's putting additional pressure on the company's profits. IBM's strategy of focusing on high-value areas where the company can carve out a competitive advantage makes sense, and while the success of the transformation is far from guaranteed, I like the company's chances.The tens of billions of dollars IBM has spent on share buybacks over the years have not been wasted, despite the recent decline in the stock price. IBM paid reasonable prices for its shares over the past five years, and with the stock price currently at depressed levels, the company should continue to buy back shares going forward.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What Investors Need to Know About IBM's Earnings,"Jan 20, 2016 at 1:40PM","International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) reported its fourth-quarter results after the market close on Jan. 19. The company beat analyst estimates for both revenue and earnings, but a year-over-year revenue decline marks the 15th quarter in a row that the century-old technology company has reported declining sales. Guidance for 2016 was also disappointing, with IBM expecting earnings to decline again this year, following an earnings decline in 2015. Here's what investors need to know about IBM's fourth-quarter results.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Earnings rundownIBM reported quarterly revenue of $22.1 billion, down 9% year over year but slightly higher than analysts' expectations. Most of this decline was due to currency fluctuations; on an adjusted basis, revenue fell by just 2% year over year. A strong U.S. dollar has been wreaking havoc on IBM's headline numbers for the past few quarters, but the adjusted figures are a more relevant indication of the performance of the company.By geographic region, here's how IBM performed during the quarter:RegionReported RevenueReported Revenue GrowthAdjusted Revenue GrowthAmericas$10.3 billion(8%)(4%)Europe/ME/Africa$7.3 billion(9%)1%Asia-Pacific$4.4 billion(10%)(3%)DATA SOURCE: IBM EARNINGS RELEASE.All of IBM's segments suffered year-over-year revenue declines during the fourth quarter, but adjusting for currency, the situation doesn't look quite as dire:SegmentReported RevenueReported Revenue GrowthAdjusted Revenue GrowthSoftware$6.8 billion(11%)(6%)Global technology services (GTS)$8.1 billion(7%)1%Global business services$4.3 billion(10%)(4%)Hardware$2.4 billion(1%)3%Financing$0.5 billion(15%)(6%)DATA SOURCE: IBM EARNINGS RELEASE.While weakness in software is something to be concerned about, strength in both the GTS and hardware segments on an adjusted basis points to at least some things going right for IBM. Growth in hardware sales was driven by a 21% year-over-year increase in mainframe sales, as well as an 8% increase in sales of Power systems. IBM has worked over the past few years to reposition its Power business through the OpenPOWER initiative, and growth in that segment is encouraging.IBM's strategic imperatives, which include cloud, analytics, security, mobile, and social, grew by 10% year over year during the fourth quarter, or 16% on an adjusted basis. During 2015, the strategic imperatives accounted for 35% of IBM's total revenue, generating $28.9 billion in sales. These are the areas where IBM is betting big, and while declines in other parts of the company currently more than offset strong strategic imperative growth, a double-digit growth rate is impressive given the size of these businesses.For the full year, total cloud revenue increased by 57%, adjusted for currency to $10.2 billion. Cloud-delivered-as-a-service is now at a $5.3 billion annual run rate, compared to $3.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. Analytics generated $17.9 billion of revenue for the year, growing by 16% adjusted for currency. Mobile revenue more than tripled, and security revenue grew by 12%.Turning to profit, IBM reported fourth-quarter operating EPS of $4.84, down 17% year over year but a few cents higher than the average analyst estimate. A gain during the fourth quarter of 2014 related the divestiture of the x86 server business skewed the comparison, as did currency issues. IBM estimates that currency translation reduced its fourth-quarter profit by about $300 million.Unfortunately, IBM expects currency issues to continue into 2016, based on current spot prices as well as the roll-off of currency hedges. During 2016, IBM expects its pre-tax profit to be reduced by about $1.3 billion due to currency, with about 75% of this coming from issues related to hedging. Operating EPS is expected to be at least $13.50 for the full year, compared to $14.92 in 2015, with currency knocking off more than $1 per share in earnings.Not much has changedDespite the market's reaction to IBM's earnings, which sent the stock down considerably the next day, nothing has really changed about IBM. The company continues to shift resources to its strategic imperatives, currency continues to make the headline numbers look terrible, and the turnaround continues to make steady, if uneven, progress. I was hopeful that IBM's currency issues would be reduced this year, as I said in my IBM earnings preview, but it now looks like this won't be the case.However, all of these currency-related issues have nothing to do with the business itself, and in the long run, exchange-rate fluctuations are unlikely to matter. What does matter is the progress IBM is making moving its business toward its high-growth and high-value strategic imperatives. There's a lot of noise in IBM's results, and its guidance for 2016 is disappointing, but the company still appears to be on the right track. As always, investors will need to be patient."
Better Buy: IBM vs. Oracle,"Mar 10, 2016 at 9:20AM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) have a lot in common. Both are tech giants with illustrious histories. Both are attempting to adapt their business models to the demands of big data, the Internet of Things, and a plethora of other game-changing technology trends. And both stocks have fallen by double-digit percentages over the last 52 weeks -- far below the S&P 500 benchmark's 3% drop.For all their similarities, it's still very easy to tell these giants apart. So which one makes the better investment today? Let's go over the most important differences between IBM and Oracle to find a winner.ProfitsOver the last four quarters, IBM took home $13.4 billion in net income. That's handily ahead of Oracle's $9.2 billion.IMAGE SOURCE: ORACLE.However, Oracle takes the lead if we shift to levered free cash flows instead. There, the database veteran's $10.5 billion sprints away from IBM's $8.6 billion.High bottom-line earnings are nice, but cash is still king. Cash flows are far more difficult to manipulate than net earnings, and you don't see discounted cash flow calculations based on discounted GAAP earnings. Cash flows are the gold standard of profit measurements, and Oracle wins that duel by a landslide.You'll also notice that IBM's cash flows are lower than the company's earnings, which turns out to be an inefficient tax accounting strategy. Oracle turns that ratio upside-down, which is a more tax-effective model.Also, all of these profit figures are essentially in the same ballpark -- but IBM's annual sales are more than twice as large as Oracle's. Oracle is clearly more a more effective competitor and this fact should not be lost on anyone considering either of these names. So this contest is not even close -- Oracle's profits are of much higher quality than IBM's nowadays.GrowthBut that could change if IBM is growing its profits faster than Oracle.This is a closer race. Both companies have seen their bottom-line earnings dwindling recently, but IBM's cash flows are holding steady while Oracle's are plunging:IBM NORMALIZED INCOME (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.The picture changes a bit if we zoom out to a longer timescale. Oracle has generally beaten Big Blue's profit growth over the last five and 10 years. But the recent weakness in Oracle's cash flow trend is troubling, and the earnings comparison is a wash.So I'll call the growth battle in IBM's favor. It's not a rousing victory, but a win nonetheless.ValuationAlright, we're ending on a juicy judgment call:  OracleIBMTrailing P/E Ratio18.310.3Trailing P/S Ratio4.31.6Trailing EV/FCF Ratio14.219.1DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE.As you can see, IBM looks far more affordable when using common metrics like price to earnings or price to sales. But in terms of enterprise value to free cash flows, Oracle comes out further down the bargain pile.Since that third metric deals with cash profits, and also accounts for Oracle's far larger cash reserves, it's arguably the most important of these valuation methods.So, IBM will often win this comparison at a glance -- because many data sources simply don't report EV/FCF values at all. But if you take time to do that math, Oracle comes out on top again. It's another close race, but a clear win anyhow.Winner: OracleWith two wins against IBM's lone victory, Oracle takes the cake. But it's a tarnished crown, and both tech giants have a lot to prove right now.The big caveat here is that IBM took the growth title which could point to future victories in other areas, too. But my Tarot cards are in for repairs today, so I can't tell for sure how all of that will work out over the next few years.I will say that Oracle has a tough row to hoe. Its flagship relational database product is under fire from NoSQL alternatives such as Cassandra, MongoDB, and Couchbase. Customers have been slow to adopt Oracle's own NoSQL solutions, leaving the company at a disadvantage in this sea change.As for IBM, it's the turnaround that never seems to gain traction. Big Blue has been selling low-margin assets to focus on software, services, and the Internet of Things in a big way. This strategy has been expensive so far, and margins have not yet expanded like they should.Buying either IBM or Oracle today means that you expect the company to overcome these challenges. That analysis could throw my comparison right out the window. But at least you have a starting point.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Better Buy: Cisco Systems, Inc. or IBM?","Mar 1, 2016 at 11:27AM","IMAGE SOURCE: CISCO.IBM (NYSE:IBM) has been a tech giant since the 19th century. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) built its fortunes -- and the networking foundations of the Internet itself -- in the 1990s.Both stocks have produced plenty of millionaires over the years. But both are also facing brand new challenges in the ever-changing tech markets. Which technology behemoth is better suited for the next new era? Which one is the better investment right now?Let's find out.ProfitsLet's start from the top:At $82 billion, Big Blue's annual revenues are nearly twice as plentiful as Cisco's mere $50 billion,.In terms of EBITDA profits, IBM's annual $19.6 billion haul is nearly 40% larger than Cisco's $14.3 billion.Dropping down to net income, IBM's advantage shrinks to just 30%.And in terms of levered free cash flows, Cisco actually runs neck and neck with IBM. With both of their annual cash flow intakes sitting near $10.5 billion, IBM's towering revenue lead shrinks to a mere 4% difference on the cash flow line.Yes, IBM runs the higher-volume business here. But Big Blue's lead only shrinks, the further away we get from simple revenues and closer to high-quality cash profits.All else being equal, I would rather own the company with the wider profit margins and stronger cash generation per incoming revenue dollar. This round goes to Cisco.GrowthCurrent profits are only one piece of a larger puzzle. Seasoned investors know to look for companies that can grow their sales and earnings over time. Let's see how Cisco and IBM stack up in terms of 5-year revenue growth:IBM REVENUE (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTSOuch. IBM has been actively selling off or spinning out several operations during this time span, from PC systems to mid-range server hardware. The idea is to strengthen margins in the long run, but at the cost of sacrificing top-line revenues right away. Cisco has been moving in the opposite direction, often moving into the very spaces that IBM is getting out of. And a sale is a sale, so Cisco's revenue trend looks strong.Alright, so if IBM is looking for wider margin while Cisco goes chasing sales, it stands to reason that IBM's cash profits must be outgrowing its cross-country rival, right?...right?IBM FREE CASH FLOW (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTSWell, that didn't work out either. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty's turnaround plan was always expected to take a while, but the traction is still nowhere in sight after four years in the slow lane.Alright, OK. Let me drop any pretense of a fair and balanced analysis and give IBM an easy win. Big Blue is famous for its commitment to strong dividend growth, often going as far as taking out billion-dollar loans just to keep the dividend fires burning. And Cisco only started paying dividends five years ago, making it a toddler in this duel where victories often are built on long-term experience:IBM DIVIDENDS PAID (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTSThat's it. I give up. While it's true that Cisco started this particular comparison from a much lower base value, which makes for quicker percentage gains over time, the networking titan really wasn't supposed to beat IBM here. But it did, and both companies currently sport annual dividend yields between 3% and 4%.There's just no other way to call the growth battle: Cisco wins again.ValuationSo we're rounding into the final round with Cisco already holding an insurmountable 2-0 lead. But that doesn't mean that IBM goes home entirely empty-handed.Big Blue's shares currently trade for less than 10 times trailing earnings, while Cisco's P/E is a much plumper 13 times trailing earnings. IBM is also more affordable in the light of price to free cash flows (though the difference is less impressive there). And since IBM bests Cisco's return on assets and return on equity, many a traditional value investor would argue that Big Blue is a better steward of investor capital and therefore deserves a richer valuation.IBM CEO GINNI ROMETTY. SOURCE: IBM.Reaching that conclusion would, of course, require investors to turn a blind eye to the profit margins and growth trends we already covered here. But it's fair to say that IBM's shares are priced to account for the stumbles in recent years, and for the possibility that Rometty never gets that turnaround effort off the ground.Cisco shares are not expensive, but IBM's are priced for utter disaster. So if you see IBM slugging its way through these lean years, that's where you'll find the bigger buy-in discount today.So IBM hangs out at the bottom of the bargain bin while Cisco supports its slightly ritzier valuation with healthier current business trends. As an IBM shareholder myself, I'll admit that the opposite situation would be much more comfortable.I'm not selling my IBM holdings based on this analysis, since I still think that Rometty is pulling in the correct direction and that her efforts must eventually bear fruit. But I'm also walking away with a healthy respect for what Cisco is doing. That was not always the case."
The Army Wants a Star Trek-Like Universal Translator -- and Wants IBM to Build It,"Apr 23, 2016 at 8:13AM","IMAGE SOURCE: DARPA.84 invasions.107 ""military involvements.""Out of 194 countries.In 2014, former television executives Christopher Kelly and Stuart Laycock set out on an unusual adventure -- to chronicle America's military involvement in every country around the globe, and across nearly three centuries of American history. According to their book, America Invades, America has invaded ""or been militarily involved with"" 191 out of Earth's 194 countries.(If you're curious, the ones we haven't gotten around to invading yet include Liechtenstein [a 15-mile long swath of alpine territory sandwiched between Austria and Switzerland], Andorra [another European principality, this one occupying several hundred square kilometers along the France-Spain border], and Bhutan [a landlocked country on the eastern end of the Himalayas]. Add up the populations of these three territories, and fewer than 1 million of Earth's citizens have not had the opportunity to meet an American soldier.)Yet.The problemThis poses a problem for the American soldier. As DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, explains: ""the volume of information encountered by [the U.S. military], the speed at which it arrives, and the diversity of languages and media through which it is communicated make identifying and acting on relevant information a serious challenge. At the same time, there is a need to communicate with non-English-speaking local populations of foreign countries, but it is at present costly and difficult for DoD to do so.""Translation: We're involved in so many countries, with people speaking so many languages, that it's hard to know all the time what they're actually saying.The solutionEnter BOLT, the Broad Operational Language Translation project. Initiated by DARPA in 2011, and now contracted out to IBM (NYSE:IBM), BOLT aims ""to create new techniques for automated translation and linguistic analysis,"" allowing ""communication with non-English-speaking populations"" in the countries America is invading today (and tomorrow).In essence, it's a project to build a sort of Star Trek universal communicator that will allow soldiers to:UNIVERSAL TRANSLATORS. NOW AVAILABLE FOR JUST $59.90 ON AMAZON.COM. IMAGE SOURCE: AMAZON.COM..Interface with local populations by ""chat, messaging and informal conversation.""Enable ""multi-turn communication in text and speech with non-English speakers.""""Quickly identify targeted information in foreign-language sources using natural-language queries"" (E.g., ""Hello, Siri. Where is al-Qaeda today?"")Why should investors be interested in this?IBM has been hard at work on the BOLT project for close to five years now. According to government records, the BOLT contract was initially awarded to the company back in 2011 and valued at roughly $6.6 million. Since that time, though, the value of the contract has fluctuated.For example, at one point, the total ceiling value on BOLT development was pegged at $32.8 million. A recent update on the program, as described in the Pentagon's daily rundown of contracts awarded in early April, dropped the development contract's value back down to $25.4 million.Really, though, whether we're talking about $25.4 million for development, $32.8 million, or anything in between, BOLT's development value isn't the point. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, IBM as a whole took in more than $81.7 billion in revenue last year. It's inevitable, therefore, that any number of development dollars DARPA allocates to BOLT will amount to less than a rounding error on IBM's financial statements.Where this contract really gets interesting -- and where it gets the potential to move the needle at IBM -- is when the company succeeds in its development of BOLT and begins producing universal translators for the military.Across active duty, reserves, and National Guard, the U.S. military currently has nearly 2.3 million servicemembers. Picking a number out of thin air, production of a BOLT universal translator selling for, say, $642 a unit (the cost of a standard-issue M4A1 carbine, but much less than the cost of the Army's new man-packable radio) has the potential to become an instant $1.5 billion program for IBM. And that's not accounting for spare parts, services such as software upgrades, networking, and storage and processing of data. Even in the context of a company as big as IBM, you can see how BOLT is a significant opportunity.Will the opportunity materialize? Only time will tell. But as long as DARPA keeps the funds flowing to IBM, we can at least assume the project is alive and kicking.UNIVERSAL TRANSLATION HAS BEEN LONG BEEN A GOAL OF THE U.S. MILITARY -- TO DATE, AN UNREALIZED GOAL.

Why IBM Is Betting Big on Blockchain,"Nov 10, 2016 at 9:40AM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.While bitcoin and other digital currencies have so far failed to live up to their promise, the underlying blockchain technology has the potential to transform countless industries. A distributed, decentralized database that records transactions in a way that can't be altered, blockchain is being touted as a way to remove inefficiencies, saving time and money.IBM goes all-in on blockchainThere is perhaps no company making a bigger blockchain push than International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). Finance is one area where blockchain has found early adopters, so it should be no surprise that IBM is leading the charge. The company counts as clients more than 90 of the top 100 banks worldwide. Any significant technological change in the banking industry not being spearheaded by IBM risks the company losing that valuable customer base.IBM has announced a flurry of partnerships and initiatives related to blockchain in recent weeks. The company is working with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ to use blockchain for contracts between business partners. IBM is teaming with China UnionPay to develop a blockchain-based system for sharing loyalty points between multiple banks. A partnership with SBI Securities to test blockchain technology for a new bond trading system was announced in late October.According to an IBM study, 15% of banks surveyed plan to have blockchains in commercial production by 2017, and 91% of banks are investing in blockchain for deposit-taking. The World Economic Forum estimates that 80% of banks are actively working on blockchain projects. This rapid adoption has forced IBM to be aggressive in order to maintain its position as a major supplier of IT to the banking industry.Finance isn't the only opportunity IBM sees with blockchain. CEO Virginia Rometty recently penned an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, laying out the case that blockchain could be just as transformative as the internet. If that ends up being the case, IBM's intense focus on the technology could pay dividends down the road.One example put forth by Rometty of where blockchain can increase efficiency is the process of buying a house:Consider the process of buying a house, a complex transaction involving banks, attorneys, title companies, insurers, regulators, tax agencies and inspectors. They all maintain separate records, and it's costly to verify and record each step. That's why the average closing takes roughly 50 days. Blockchain offers a solution: a trusted, immutable digital ledger, visible to all participants, that shows every element of the transaction.Another example is a project involving Visa and DocuSign that would allow car buyers to configure a lease and drive away with a new car immediately, without the time-consuming process of filling out mountains of paperwork. La'Zooz, a start-up in Israel, is using blockchain in a ride-sharing app that allows drivers and customers to connect directly, without the need for a middleman ride-sharing company.Making supply chains more efficient is another area where blockchain could potentially shine. IBM estimates that blockchain could generate more than $100 billion of efficiencies annually if applied to global supply chains -- a staggering number. Both Toyota and the U.S. Postal Service are currently looking into using blockchain for exactly that purpose.IBM's core aim is to solve problems for its clients. Blockchain has the potential to solve myriad problems in a variety of industries, making the technology a natural fit for Big Blue. At this point, given how new the technology is, it's impossible to say whether it will live up to its potential. But if blockchain delivers on its promises, IBM could be at the center of a major technological revolution."
Is IBM Cool Again?,"Nov 6, 2016 at 11:16AM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Just a few years ago, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) was viewed as a tech dinosaur, a stodgy legacy tech company struggling to remain relevant. IBM's integrated model of selling hardware, software, and services, which was very successful for the company last decade, didn't translate well to a world where computing resources are rented by the hour. The cloud computing revolution was led not by IBM, but by companies such as Amazon.com and salesforce.com. The old adage ""Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM"" became comically outdated.IBM has been working feverishly over the past few years under CEO Virginia Rometty to transform itself into an IT giant that can thrive in this new tech world. Legacy businesses have been sold off or de-emphasized, with resources and manpower shifted to growth areas that will form the core of the new IBM. Billions of dollars have been spent on acquisitions, cloud platforms have been built out, and technologies such as Watson, IBM's cognitive computing system, have been backed by major investments.Some still view IBM as an irrelevant tech has-been, but it's clear that the IBM of today is very different from the IBM of the past. IBM's cloud business has exploded, with cloud delivered as a service reaching an annual run rate of $7.5 billion in the latest quarter, up 66% year over year. The company is leading the way in a number of areas, including blockchain, which has the potential to upend various industries. And a day hardly goes by without the announcement of a new partnership or initiative involving Watson.There's no doubt that IBM still has a perception problem, but one recent deal involving Watson and a high-profile tech start-up leads me to believe that the company's image is truly on the mend.Watson comes to SlackIn late October, amid a flurry Watson-related announcements, IBM announced that it had partnered with enterprise messaging start-up Slack to bring Watson to Slack's platform. Slack's popularity has exploded in recent years, with the platform sporting 3 million daily active users as of May 2016 and adding users at a rate of 1 million every five months.Bots are one feature of Slack's platform, and the first step of the partnership will see Watson used to power an improved version of Slackbot, Slack's customer-service bot. Eventually, developers will be able to use various Watson services when building bots and other tools for the platform. Since Watson is a machine learning system, it has the capability to become more accurate and useful over time.In terms of revenue, this partnership with Slack is likely to be a drop in the bucket for IBM. But it's notable because it's an example of a tech start-up choosing IBM for -- well, anything. My guess is that IBM rarely comes up in the conversation at small tech companies like Slack. That was certainly true a few years ago, and it's probably still true today. That Slack turned to IBM is a fairly significant development, and it could spur more deals and further expand Watson's presence.IBM is still a company focused mainly on large enterprises, and that's not going to change. But the Slack partnership demonstrates that IBM has made progress rehabilitating its image. I'm not sure that I'm quite ready to say that IBM is ""cool"" again, but it's certainly moving in the right direction."
How Risky Is International Business Machines Corp.?,"Dec 19, 2016 at 8:10PM","Being a global technology company operating in more than 170 countries, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is no stranger to risk. Currency fluctuations, which hurt IBM's results in 2015, are an ever-present risk factor, particularly because IBM derives the majority of its revenue from international markets. Another risk: The potential policies of the incoming Trump administration could roil relations with countries like China, where IBM has a major presence.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.All of this matters for IBM investors. But the biggest risk, one that could have an outsize effect on the stock price going forward, is the possibility that IBM's ongoing transformation fails to reignite growth. The company's growth businesses, what it calls strategic imperatives, now account for around 40% of total revenue while still growing at a double-digit pace. Meanwhile, legacy businesses are shrinking. The net result over the past few years has been a decline in both revenue and earnings.The expectation of IBM investors is that this new revenue will be at least as profitable as the old revenue that's disappearing, thus eventually driving earnings higher when revenue begins to grow again. There are plenty of reasons to believe that this will be the case. But IBM has yet to return to earnings growth, and until it does, there will be a lingering uncertainty around its transformation.Years of declineIBM expects to produce at least $13.50 per share in adjusted earnings this year, down from $14.92 in 2015 and $16.53 in 2014. Revenue has been declining, driving a portion of the earnings decline, but currency has also played a significant role.The rapid growth of IBM's strategic imperatives has yet to balance out declines in other businesses. Cloud revenue over the past 12 months was $12.7 billion, with cloud as-a-service reaching an annual run rate of $7.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 65% year over year. Strategic imperatives in total produced $8 billion of revenue during the third quarter alone, up 15% year over year.Despite this growth, total revenue was flat during the third quarter. Part of the problem was hardware -- IBM's mainframe revenue was down substantially, a normal occurrence for where the product is in the cycle. But the bigger problem is that these growth businesses are still not big enough to drive growth for the company.Once they do become big enough to drive revenue growth, the question will be whether earnings growth returns. Is IBM's cloud business going to be profitable enough to offset declines in hardware sales? Will moving to a subscription software model produce as much profit as selling software licenses? There's a chance that IBM ends up being structurally less profitable than it has been in the past. That's the biggest risk facing investors.Reasons to be optimisticThe good news for IBM investors is that the company's strategy involves going after areas where it can build a competitive advantage. IBM's cloud strategy is to focus on enterprise customers and hybrid cloud, instead of trying to compete on cost in the infrastructure-as-a-service market. IBM will never out-Amazon Amazon, but it can provide high-value cloud solutions to its customers, including services like Watson, the company's cognitive computing system.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.IBM has one major advantage -- its existing customer base -- that shouldn't be overlooked. The company counts as customers 90% of the world's top 100 banks, 80% of the top 50 global retailers, more than 200 state and local governments, nine of the top 10 global telecom companies, and 49 of the top 50 healthcare organizations in the U.S. This large, sticky customer base increases the odds of a successful transformation for IBM and decreases the odds that the company ends up in a perpetual state of decline.IBM has yet to prove that its transformation will be successful. The company has a long track record of reinventing itself, and its massive customer base and global reach give it an important advantage. But there's certainly a chance that things go wrong. As an IBM shareholder, I think this risk is small enough to warrant investing in the stock. But it's always in the back of my mind.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

IBM Q2 Earnings Show Both Progress and Problems,"Jul 19, 2016 at 6:20PM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBMAnother quarter, another revenue decline for International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). IBM reported its second quarter results on July 18, beating analyst estimates across the board while posting a year-over-year sales decline for the 17th straight quarter. Profits tumbled as well, although the company maintained its previous earnings guidance for the full year. Here's what investors need to know.Pockets of progressIBM generated $20.2 billion of revenue during the second quarter, down 2.8% year-over-year but $210 million higher than the average analyst estimate. Currency had a minimal effect on IBM's revenue, a nice change from 2015 when swings in exchange rates reduced reported revenue by billions of dollars.IBM's strategic imperatives generated $8.3 billion of revenue, up 12% year-over-year. This collection of businesses, which includes cloud, analytics, social, mobile, and security, produced $30.7 billion of revenue over the past 12 months, about 38% of the company's total. Cloud revenue totaled $11.6 billion over the past 12 months, with cloud-as-a-service revenue hitting a $6.7 billion annual run rate at the end of the second quarter, up 50% year-over-year.Only one of IBM's five segments produced growth. The cognitive solutions segment, which includes solutions software and transaction processing software, grew revenue by 3.5% year-over-year. Growth was driven by analytics, Watson, security, and cloud computing, and partially offset by shrinking legacy businesses.The rest of IBM's segments shrunk. Global business services revenue declined by 2%, technology services and cloud platforms revenue declined by 0.5%, systems revenue slumped 23.2%, and global financing revenue dropped by 11.3%. The big drop in systems revenue was due to the mainframe product cycle, while lower services revenue reflects IBM's ongoing transformation.While software is no longer its own segment, IBM still provides information on software sales. Total software revenue grew by 1% adjusted for currency during the second quarter, marking the first quarter of growth since early 2014. This was driven by a 7% increase in annuity revenue. With IBM shifting toward cloud computing and subscription software, it appears that the transition is finally driving software sales growth.IMAGE SOURCE: IBMEarnings declineIBM reported a steep drop in profits during the second quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $2.95, down 23% year-over-year but $0.06 better than analysts were expecting. Lower revenue and higher R&D costs are partly to blame, as is a slightly higher tax rate compared to the same period last year.For the full year, IBM expects to produce at least $13.50 in non-GAAP earnings, which would represent a decline of about 9.5% compared to 2015. With non-GAAP earnings dropping by 19% in the first quarter and 23% in the second quarter, IBM will need to make up some ground during the second half of 2016.CFO Martin Schroeter stated during IBM's first quarter earnings call that he expected the company to produce between 38% and 39% of its full-year profit during the first half. Through two quarters, IBM has now generated just over 39% of its full-year earnings guidance. In 2015, the first two quarters were responsible for 45% of annual profits.Part of IBM's earnings decline during the first half of the year is due to earnings being shifted to the second half of the year. While a 23% decline in earnings sounds terrible, it's not quite as bad as it seems, assuming that IBM hits its full-year guidance.Encouraging signsIBM is still very much in the middle of its multi-year transformation, but there were some significant signs of progress during the second quarter. Strategic imperatives and cloud computing revenue continue to grow rapidly, and newer businesses in the cognitive computing segment are growing fast enough to offset weakness elsewhere. A return to software sales growth is also encouraging.More than 60% of IBM's annual earnings will need to come during the second half of the year. Investors are now less pessimistic than they were six months ago, driving the stock up about 16% year-to-date. If IBM fails to deliver on its guidance during the second half, those gains could evaporate. On the other hand, hitting or surpassing its guidance for the year would suggest that IBM's turnaround is finally gaining traction.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

IBM Stock Split: Is It Time for Big Blue to Make a Move?,"Sep 12, 2016 at 1:17PM","The rise of the personal computer changed the course of history, and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) was at the center of the rise of the PC. Over the years, the longtime member of the Dow Jones Industrials has represented an icon of the American corporate world, and IBM investors have reaped the rewards both with dividends and with stock splits that have helped boost the tech company's overall returns. After making no move during the 21st century, however, some investors would like to see IBM do a stock split to try to reawaken interest in the company. Let's take a look at IBM's past stock splits to figure out whether investors should expect a future split in the near future.IBM'S WATSON IS A BIG PART OF ITS FUTURE GROWTH PLANS. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.IBM stock splitsDate of SplitSplit RatioJan. 16, 19465 for 4Jan. 23, 19487 for 4May 7, 19545 for 4May 4, 19565 for 4May 5, 19593 for 2May 5, 19613 for 2May 5, 19645 for 4May 3, 19663 for 2May 9, 19682 for 1May 10, 19735 for 4May 10, 19794 for 1May 9, 19972 for 1May 10, 19992 for 1DATA SOURCE: IBM INVESTOR RELATIONS.As you can see, IBM has made many stock splits over its history, and since 1970, the stock has provided a solid average annual return of about 8%. That's not as high as some other tech companies, but when you consider that the company saw much of its growth in the 1950s and 1960s, the staying power is even more impressive.When IBM split its sharesIBM's stock split strategy falls into two different eras. In the 1950s through the 1970s, IBM's stock split moves tended to be gradual and reflected appreciation in the share price fairly generally. The number of small 5-for-4 splits accentuates the conservative nature of Big Blue, and it also was one of the only stocks not to hesitate to allow its shares to trade at high price levels. For instance, in the 1960s, IBM traded as high as around $650 per share, and even when Big Blue split its shares, it nevertheless typically stayed in triple-digit territory.More recently, IBM adopted a slightly more conventional strategy in the 1990s. At that time, when IBM's stock threatened to cross the $200 per share mark, 2-for-1 splits allowed IBM's share price to return to the high double-digits.What's happened with IBM since the turn of the millennium?The problems that IBM has faced since its most recent stock split in 1999 are numerous. Early on, the bursting of the tech bubble in the early 2000s sent IBM's share price down substantially, and although it escaped the full carnage that some newer tech companies ended up suffering, IBM nevertheless took a big hit. Moreover, unlike some of its rivals, IBM shares didn't quickly bounce back in the years after the tech bust ended.IBM has two things that have held down its share price. First, from a fundamental standpoint, Big Blue hasn't been able to generate the growth it once enjoyed. The company was smart to diversify away from personal computers fairly early on, avoiding the full brunt of the move toward mobile devices. Yet since then, IBM has faced considerable competition from other tech giants that have had similar ideas toward moving into higher-margin services and consulting work.The other thing that has held IBM back is the rise in its dividend yield and the subsequent downward pressure on share prices. Big Blue has been diligent about paying dividends throughout its history, even when most tech giants didn't. However, recent dividend growth has been extensive, and the stock now carries a dividend yield of more than 3.5%. Typically, dividend payments lead to reductions in share price, and so the greater siphoning of dividend income has put a ceiling on share prices.Will IBM split again?It's not impossible to conceive of IBM choosing to split its stock, especially if it can turn things around with its fundamental business and build up a new competitive advantage. Yet the overall reduction in stock split activity across the market suggests that IBM would likely be even more conservative than usual in considering a future move. Absent a big recovery in its core market, IBM shareholders shouldn't expect a stock split anytime in the near future."
10 Reasons to Buy IBM Stock and Never Sell,"Oct 31, 2016 at 1:42PM","Updated on March 8, 2017, and originally published on Oct. 31, 2016.Shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) haven't fared well over the past few years. Revenue and earnings have been in a prolonged slump as IBM aims to transform itself, and the market hasn't shown much patience. The stock is down about 17% from its peak in 2013.Despite the poor performance of the stock, IBM is still a great company worth buying and holding for the long run. Here are 10 reasons to buy IBM and never sell.1. A long track record of adaptationFounded over a century ago, IBM originally manufactured and sold products such as commercial scales, cheese slicers, and tabulators. Recognizing that its lucrative mechanical tabulating equipment would soon be no match for computers, IBM invested heavily to build its first mainframe system in 1964. IBM sells mainframes to this day.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.In the early 1990s, the company was forced to transform itself once again, after its business nearly collapsed. The software and services model was adopted, and IBM grew into a global powerhouse offering integrated solutions. Today, IBM is undergoing yet another transformation, this time to a cloud and cognitive-computing company. The changes have been painful, but IBM's history of reinventing itself is a good reason to believe that the company can succeed.2. Making hard choicesIBM has never been shy about getting rid of businesses that no longer provide adequate returns. The company was once the leading seller of PCs, but it sold its PC business to Lenovo in 2004. This move reduced revenue, but the revenue was extremely low margin. Jumping ahead to today, with the PC market in a prolonged slump, IBM's move away from PCs looks prescient.In 2014, IBM sold its x86 server business, also to Lenovo. This move also reduced IBM's revenue, but the company recognized that it could gain no advantage selling hardware consisting of commodity parts. IBM has been shifting toward higher-value products and services for years, and its constant optimization of its portfolio of businesses is a trait few companies can match.3. A sticky customer baseIBM's push to offer integrated solutions involving hardware, software, and services has created significant switching costs for its customers. Approximately 80% of IBM's clients have deployed multiple IBM solutions, making the task of moving away from IBM more difficult.The list of IBM clients is impressive. According to IBM's 2015 investor briefing, 90 of the top 100 global banks, nine of the top 10 oil and gas companies, 92 of the top 100 healthcare organizations, and 80% of the top 50 retailers rely on IBM solutions. This broad customer base gives IBM the ability to maintain impressive profitability even as it completely transforms its business.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.4. A surging cloud businessIBM's cloud computing business produced $13.7 billion of revenue in 2016, up 35% compared to 2015. IBM's as-a-service cloud annual revenue run rate, which includes infrastructure-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, and software-as-a-service, reached $8.6 billion, up 61% year over year.IBM is far from the largest cloud infrastructure provider, and it will probably never be as big as Amazon.com's AWS or Microsoft's Azure. But IBM's cloud strategy is to offer high-value, differentiated solutions, such as analytics and security. The business of renting commodity computing resources, while an important part of IBM's cloud business, is not the main focus.5. Making smart betsIBM has largely avoided the kinds of large, transformative acquisitions tech giants make that rarely turn out well. Instead, IBM generally buys up smaller companies to build out its product offerings. Between 2011 and 2015, IBM spent $13 billion on acquisitions, along with $48 billion on research and development and capital expenditures.Recent acquisitions include Promontory Financial Group, a financial consulting firm; EZSource, an application discovery company; and Bluewolf Group, a cloud consulting provider. None of these acquisitions is a game changer on its own, but they collectively represent IBM's attempt to broaden its portfolio and capabilities. IBM's ability to avoid making disastrous acquisitions as many of its peers have is a real asset.6. WatsonThe face of IBM's transformation is Watson, the company's cognitive-computing system. Watson is expected to eventually become a major business, and IBM has been entering partnerships for the past few years in an effort to push Watson into a broad array of industries. The company expects 1 billion people to use Watson in some form by the end of next year, a milestone that suggests that Watson is gaining traction.Last year, General Motors announced that it will use Watson in a new version of its OnStar system to provide personalized offers. The recently acquired Promontory Financial Group will also use Watson to help clients reduce spending on compliance. Slack, an enterprise messaging start-up, plans to use Watson to improve its customer-service bot. The list goes on and on. Watson may not yet contribute much revenue for IBM, but the future looks bright.7. The healthcare moonshotOne area where Watson is actively being used is the healthcare industry. Through various partnerships with healthcare organizations, Watson is helping doctors provide better diagnoses and treatment options. The system can churn through an immense amount of data, including medical records, journal articles, and books, giving doctors the information they need to make better decisions.Last year, IBM and Quest Diagnostics expanded a partnership that will see Watson more broadly available to consume genomic information from tissue samples and provide better treatments for cancer patients. The global healthcare industry is immense, and IBM's aggressive push to apply Watson to a broad set of healthcare problems could pay dividends down the road.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.8. OpenPOWERIntel currently dominates the market for server chips, enjoying a near monopoly and abundant profit margins. IBM, through the OpenPOWER foundation, aims to chip away at Intel's lead by teaming with a broad set of companies to build an ecosystem around its Power chips. The OpenPOWER foundation includes giants such as Alphabet's Google, NVIDIA, Micron, and Samsung, as well as more than 100 other member companies.The process of reclaiming meaningful market share from Intel has been slow, but some good news emerged last year. Google is developing an open server architecture based on IBM's upcoming POWER9 processors, a move that could see the company, as well as other cloud computing providers, move away from being 100% Intel. That's good news for IBM's Power business.9. A solid dividendIBM has paid a quarterly dividend without fail since 1916, and it's raised that dividend for 21 years in a row. The most recent quarterly dividend payment, $1.40 per share, puts the stock's dividend yield at roughly 3.1%.IBM's payout ratio, based on 2016 non-GAAP EPS, is just 41%, meaning that the company has room to grow the dividend faster than it grows earnings. Expecting continued high-single-digit dividend growth going forward seems realistic, and it makes IBM a stock to buy and hold.10. An attractive valuationIBM expects to produce $13.80 in per-share adjusted earnings in 2017, up from $13.59 in 2016, which puts the P/E ratio at about 13. The company's transformation is making meaningful progress, with strategic imperatives now accounting for 41% of revenue and still growing at a double-digit rate.The market is pricing IBM at a pessimistic valuation, with the assumption that the company won't be able to return to robust earnings growth. Given IBM's history and guidance for a return to earnings growth this year, I wouldn't underestimate Big Blue."
International Business Machines Corp's Biggest Failure in 2016 So Far,"Sep 4, 2016 at 12:00PM","I recently discussed International Business Machines' (NYSE:IBM) business model and its three best moves in 2016. Those moves included its partnerships with NVIDIA in machine-learning GPUs, Cisco in edge analytics, and Workday in cloud-based HR management.Today, I'll focus on IBM's biggest failure of the year -- failing to break its streak of 17 consecutive quarters of year-over-year revenue declines. Let's discuss why IBM's top-line growth is in such bad shape, and how it plans to get its sales back on track.IBM STUDIO, LONDON. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.The infamous $20 promiseIBM's current problems can largely be attributed to former CEO Sam Palmisano's plan to double the company's earnings per share from $10.01 in 2009 to $20 by 2015. That plan sounded impressive and even Warren Buffett, who famously avoids tech stocks, had Berkshire Hathaway take a $10.7 billion stake in IBM.However, Palmisano's plan was comprised of shedding IBM's lower-margin businesses to protect its bottom line, cutting costs, and repurchasing billions of dollars in stock. This strategy artificially inflated IBM's earnings per share, but prevented the company from making any major purchases in the higher-growth cloud, mobility, and analytics markets.As a result, IBM fell behind companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, which emerged as the market leaders in cloud platforms. As a result, demand for IBM's older IT services, software, and hardware -- mostly on-premise solutions -- stalled and caused its revenue growth to dry up. IBM's earnings also never hit Palmisano's $20 target. Its EPS from continuing operations came in at just $14.92 in 2015.Rometty to the rescue?Ginni Rometty, a 30-year veteran of the company, replaced Palmisano as CEO in 2012. Rometty finally pivoted IBM away from its unsustainable strategy of inflating earnings.In 2013, IBM acquired cloud infrastructure giant Softlayer Technologies for $2 billion in an aggressive bid to catch up to Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. It followed up that purchase with more big buys in the cloud and analytics space -- including cybersecurity firm Trusteer for $1 billion, mobile device management firm Fiberlink Communications for $330 million, health imaging software maker Merge Healthcare for $1 billion, storage software maker Cleversafe for $1.3 billion, healthcare analytics company Truven Health Analytics for $2.6 billion, and Salesforce systems integrator Blue Wolf Group for $200 million.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Rometty rebranded the five businesses of cloud, analytics, social, mobile, and security as IBM's ""strategic imperatives."" The ultimate goal was to have these businesses grow fast enough to offset the declines at its legacy businesses. But based on IBM's revenue growth last quarter, those businesses simply aren't growing rapidly enough to boost its top-line growth back to positive territory. SegmentQ2 SalesQ2 Sales Growth (YOY)Strategic Imperatives Growth (within the unit)Segment Sales From Strategic ImperativesCognitive solutions$4.7 billion4%9%64%Global business services$4.3 billion(3%)13%53%Technology services and cloud platforms$8.9 billion0%35%22%Systems$2.0 billion(23%)(14%)45%DATA SOURCE: IBM INVESTOR PRESENTATION. YOY = YEAR-OVER-YEAR.Why aren't these businesses growing fast enough?IBM's total strategic imperatives revenue rose 12% annually last quarter, and accounted for 38% of its revenue over the past 12 months. Unfortunately, that represents a slowdown from 14% growth in the first quarter and 20% growth in the prior-year quarter. That growth is also pretty weak compared to Amazon's numbers.Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue rose 58% annually to $2.89 billion last quarter, and it had an annual run rate of $11.5 billion. IBM's entire cloud-as-a-service business had an annual run rate of just $6.7 billion last quarter. The Bluemix platform, which competes against AWS in the higher-growth cloud platform market, only had an annual run rate of about $600 million as of last October, according to Forrester Research.Amazon's scale and ""best in breed"" reputation allow it to serve massive customers like NASA, the CDC, Netflix, and Salesforce with its servers. If they don't go with Amazon, they'll likely consider Microsoft's Azure or Google's Cloud Platform before considering Bluemix. That's why IBM's strategic imperatives growth is slowing down.How many more quarters of declines are ahead?IBM's revenue will continue falling as long as its strategic imperatives fail to offset the declines at its older businesses. Analysts expect that trend to continue, with revenue expected to fall 1.5% this quarter, 1.3% next quarter, and 2.6% for the full year. Unless IBM reverses this trend, we could start tracking its revenue declines in years instead of quarters."
Will International Business Machines Corp. Raise Its Dividend in 2017?,"Dec 6, 2016 at 5:39PM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.IT giant International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has paid investors uninterrupted quarterly dividends since 1916, and it has increased that dividend for 21 years in a row. The latest dividend hike, which was in April of this year, boosted the quarterly payment to $1.40 per share. That's an 8% increase compared to the prior payment.IBM has ramped up its dividend over the past decade, turning what was once a lackluster dividend stock into one of the best in the technology sector. The quarterly dividend has grown from just $0.30 per share in 2006, a nearly fivefold increase that, combined with a slumping stock price over the past few years, has pushed IBM's dividend yield up to around 3.5%.IBM DIVIDEND YIELD (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.With IBM's dividend already more generous than many of its big tech peers, is another dividend increase coming next year? Almost certainly.Plenty of cash to go aroundDespite IBM's ongoing transformation, which has knocked down revenue and profit over the past few years, the company remains a cash flow machine. IBM expects to produce about $12 billion of free cash flow this year, the bulk of which will be returned to shareholders.The current $1.40-per-share quarterly dividend costs IBM about $5.35 billion each year, or 44.6% of the company's expected free cash flow. It's important to note that this free cash flow number is depressed; when and if IBM returns to growth, free cash flow should start to recover as well.IBM has also been spending heavily on acquisitions. Through the first nine months of this year, IBM has spent $5.4 billion on acquisitions, more than six times as much as it spent during the same period last year. IBM has been building out its cloud capabilities with some of these purchases, adding companies like Ustream and Sanovi Technologies. Others represent big bets on specific areas. Truven Health Analytics and Promontory Financial Group further IBM's plan to push Watson, its cognitive computing system, into various industries with long-term growth potential.Share repurchases also eat up billions of dollars, but IBM has slowed the pace of buybacks in recent years. The company spent more than $10 billion on buybacks annually from 2011 through 2014, but it has since shifted its priorities. Reducing its share count by 2% to 3% each year is the new plan, representing between $3 billion and $4.5 billion of spending annually.I suspect that IBM's pace of acquisitions will slow down a bit in 2017, given how much the company has spent this year. And share buybacks can be shifted up and down at will. CFO Martin Schroeter had this to say during IBM's latest earnings conference call: ""We will absolutely continue to grow the dividend, and then to the extent that we have excess capital to return, we will return it. And over the long term, that number from a share repurchase would be a 2% to 3% reduction.""Growing the dividend comes first, which should be music to dividend investors' ears.When to expect a dividend raiseIBM has been consistent with its annual dividend increases, keeping the same schedule for the past 15 years, even throughout the financial crisis. If that schedule holds, an announcement will come in late April or early May, with a record date around May 10 and a payable date around June 10. Investors will receive two more dividend payments before any increase, assuming nothing unexpected happens. The first will be paid on Dec. 10, and the second will be paid around March 10.The size of next year's dividend increase is an open question. Given the fact that IBM's profits are still in decline, a double-digit increase may be too much to ask for. A mid- to high-single-digit increase seems like the most likely scenario; a new quarterly payment of $1.50 per share would be a nice even number.IBM will almost certainly raise its dividend next year, rewarding shareholders for sticking around as it works to transform itself into a cloud- and cognitive-computing powerhouse. The increase may be smaller than in in the past, but with a dividend yield already greater than that of many other large technology companies, investors should have little reason to complain."
Why IBM Stock Is Up 12% in 2016,"Jun 25, 2016 at 6:46AM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.What: Shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) are up 12% so far this year as of market close on June 21, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The company's ongoing transformation has led to years of revenue declines, which in turn drove down the stock price. Pessimism peaked early in 2016, and a strong recovery since then has propelled IBM stock higher in 2016.IBM DATA BY YCHARTS.So what: IBM reported its fourth-quarter results in January, beating analyst estimates on all fronts. But the company's guidance for 2016 of ""at least $13.50"" in per-share adjusted earnings represented a decline compared to 2015. Currency exchange rates were one reason for the lackluster guidance, but the company also pointed to delayed software signings hurting its results.IBM stock bottomed out in February, briefly dropping below $120 per share. Since then, IBM has surged for a few reasons. Despite the company's weak results, a single-digit PE ratio is incredibly pessimistic, and investors looking for bargains no doubt took advantage of that low price.IBM announced various acquisitions over the past few months that may have helped improve investor sentiment toward the stock. IBM bought Truven Health Analytics in February for $2.6 billion, with the goal of integrating the company's technology and data into its Watson Health business unit. Cybersecurity company Resilient Systems was also acquired in February, boosting IBM's fast-growing security business.March brought two more acquisitions: Optevia, a cloud software integrator, and Bluewolf Group, a cloud software consulting company. These deals made it clear that IBM's cloud strategy isn't simply to compete on price with big players like Amazon's AWS, but to focus on areas where the company could bring value to its clients.A solid first-quarter report in April allowed IBM to maintain these gains. The company again beat analyst estimates on all fronts, and it boosted its free cash flow guidance for the full year. A $1.2 billion tax benefit seemed to taint the company's results, but that benefit was completely offset by one-time restructuring charges.Now what: IBM stock is still down substantially over the past few years, and the company's ongoing transformation, while showing progress, has yet to produce growth. There's still quite a bit of pessimism surrounding IBM, and it may take years before it becomes clear whether IBM's strategy will ultimately pay off.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: HP vs. IBM,"Jul 4, 2016 at 8:08AM","Though they play in different sandboxes after recent decisions altered their respective businesses, both HP (NYSE:HPQ) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) still have a lot in common. In addition to being signature members of the tech industry's ""old guard,"" both HP and IBM have undergone drastic, and much-needed, transformations the past couple of years.HP's decision to split off its software and services unit into Hewlett-Packard Enterprises to focus on its PC and printing solutions was a big one, to be sure. But IBM's transformation away from chips, hardware, and related old-school technologies has been just as impactful for shareholders. So, which is the better buy, HP or IBM?IMAGE SOURCE: HP.The case for HPMost tech investors are aware of the dire condition of the world's PC market. According to technology research company Gartner, worldwide PC shipments declined again in the first quarter, to 64.8 million units -- the lowest number since 2007. About the only good news following the dismal report is that HP's 11.41 million PC units moved during the first quarter was a slight improvement in market share, to 17.6%.Last quarter's 10% decline in revenue from the personal systems segment, to $6.99 billion, could have been much worse if not for HP's relatively strong commercial sales, which dropped a ""mere"" 7%. Revenue from HP's consumer segment fell 16% in fiscal 2016's second quarter. The question is, how does HP stop the bleeding? By positioning itself as the innovation leader -- case in point, HP's new Spectre laptop, billed as the ""world's thinnest.""HP also has plans to kick-start its printing business, which really took a beating in Q2, dropping 16%, to $4.64 billion. Once again, consumer sales was the culprit, with printer revenue down a whopping 18%. For HP, a continued emphasis on enterprise sales and its foray into the 3D printing market could be the unit's saving grace.3D printing generated $5.17 billion in revenue last year, and HP's latest ""production-ready 3D printing system,"" along with its bevy of desktop units, should give it a leg up in what are still the early stages of the budding industry.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.The case for IBMIBM's transformation continues to dictate how CEO Ginni Rometty and team are looking to the future. IBM stock has quietly risen 9% this year (HP is up 4.5%), but that has hardly quieted its critics as total revenue continues to decline. However, to determine which stock is the better buy, investors need to recognize Rometty's ""strategic imperatives"" are the future of IBM.IBM reported a 4.6% drop in revenue in Q1, to $18.68 billion, and will likely mark further declines when it shares Q2 results July 18. The naysayers also lament IBM's nearly 21% drop in hardware and related sales last quarter, but those are legacy businesses. IBM's success will be determined by its performance in the cloud, cognitive computing or artificial intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT) analytics.Toward that end, IBM's Q1 wasn't quite hitting on all cylinders, but there was a lot to like. Combined, strategic imperative sales are now at an annual run rate of $29.8 billion, equal to 37% of total revenue. Thanks in large part to the opportunity IBM's cognitive computing solutions represent, analysts think strategic imperatives will account for over 50% of IBM's revenue by this time next year -- well ahead of Rometty's own target of 40% by 2018.HP and IBM share another important characteristic: Each is near the top of the dividend-paying heap in the tech industry. HP's dividend yield is 4%, while IBM is close behind, offering shareholders 3.75%. But when it comes to which stock offers the best opportunity going forward, IBM has the upper hand, for a couple of reasons.First, HP is overly reliant on PCs and printers, both dying industries in their current form. HP's innovative tablets and 3D printers should give shareholders some hope, but there remain too many uncertainties and obstacles to overcome. Second, IBM's migration into cloud, AI, and IoT analytics sales offers limitless upside, as each category is further along the growth curve than HP's tablets or 3D printers. Investor patience is necessary in either case, but IBM will reward that patience before HP manages to.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons International Business Machines Corp. Stock Could Rise,"Dec 12, 2016 at 8:52PM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) have surged so far this year, up about 20% year to date. This rally was preceded by a multiyear decline; the stock is down about 15% over the past five years. IBM has been engaged in a prolonged effort to transform itself into a company that can thrive in the cloud. The result has been years of revenue and earnings declines that have knocked down the stock.The good news for IBM investors is that there have been clear signs of progress. Revenue is still in decline as legacy business shrink, but IBM's growth businesses, which now account for around 40% of revenue, continue to grow at an impressive pace. Looking forward to 2017, here are three reasons IBM stock could continue to rise.IBM DATA BY YCHARTS.A possible return to growthIBM expects to produce adjusted EPS of at least $13.50 this year. That's down from $14.92 in 2015 $16.53 in 2014. This year will also mark the company's fifth consecutive annual revenue decline. Divestitures and currency fluctuations have contributed to IBM's shrinking top line, so the situation isn't quite as bad as it seems. But a half-decade of slumping sales is never good news.IBM has been focused on growing its strategic imperatives, which include cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security. These businesses generated $8 billion of revenue during the third quarter, growing by 15% year over year. Cloud revenue was up 42% to $3.4 billion, and the annual run rate of IBM's cloud-as-a-service businesses reached $7.5 billion, up 65%.This growth is being balanced by declines in legacy businesses, but an inflection point could be on the horizon. IBM will report its fourth-quarter results in January, along with guidance for 2017. An outlook that includes higher earnings next year could light a fire under the stock. Even flat earnings guidance would show that IBM is stabilizing, and that the worst is over. The moment IBM returns to growth, the stock could soar.WatsonWatson, IBM's cognitive computing system, is the face of the company's transformation. The system was used to win Jeopardy! in 2011, and has since been unleashed into a variety of industries. IBM is making a big push in the healthcare industry, where Watson is being used as part of various partnerships to improve diagnoses and patient outcomes. The company shelled out $2.6 billion earlier this year for Truven Health Analytics as part of this effort.IBM CEO Virginia Rometty saw Watson becoming a $10 billion business within a decade back in 2013. Unfortunately, the company doesn't break out Watson revenue directly. A recent reorganization of its reporting segments provided no insight, with the cognitive solutions segment including legacy software that muddles the numbers.At some point, IBM is going to need to show that Watson is capable of producing a significant amount of revenue. The big question: will IBM have an ""AWS moment,"" where the business turns out to be far more successful than nearly anyone expected? Or will Watson's results fail to live up to the expectations? A reveal of Watson's financials could send the stock higher if investors like what they see.A big dividend increaseIBM has raised its dividend for 21 consecutive years, and it has paid a quarterly dividend without fail since 1916. A dividend increase is very likely coming next year, with an announcement in late April or early May.I wouldn't expect anything more than a mid-to-high single-digit percentage increase. But IBM could go bigger, especially if its earnings guidance for next year beats expectations. The company reduced how much it spends on share buybacks in 2015 and 2016, and it may slow down its pace of acquisitions after going on a buying spree over the past year. This could free up more cash for a larger dividend hike.A big dividend increase would likely require a return to earnings growth, but it would give investors more confidence that IBM is committed to growing its dividend. Coupled with solid guidance, a larger-than-expected dividend hike next year could keep the party going for IBM stock."
How IBM's Cloud Strategy Is Different,"Jun 30, 2016 at 8:47AM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Essentially, every major technology company is actively transitioning to the cloud. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has become the overwhelming leader in the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) market, where computing resources are sold by the hour, leaving Microsoft and Alphabet's Google playing catch-up.Software companies are shifting to subscription software-as-a-service models -- in many cases, running the back ends of their applications in the cloud. Every company that consumes IT in one form or another is considering if, when, and how they should embrace cloud computing.International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has made cloud computing one of the cornerstones of its ongoing transformation. The company has acquired many companies over the past few years in an effort to build out its cloud-computing business, including cloud infrastructure company SoftLayer in 2013 and a slew of cloud-software companies. IBM competes in the infrastructure-as-service market, the platform-as-a-service market, and the software-as-a-service market, and its vast services business helps clients move to and manage cloud infrastructure.Amazon's cloud strategy revolves around being the biggest and the cheapest provider of cloud infrastructure. Microsoft has previously vowed to match Amazon's price cuts, and Google generally tries to keep pace, as well.IBM's strategy is more complicated. The company doesn't attempt to compete on price – that's a battle that's unlikely to yield an exceptional return on investment. Instead, IBM aims to do what it's always done: provide valuable solutions to its clients.Brand agnosticism is still the keyBack in the early 1990s, when IBM was saved by drastic changes made by outsider CEO Lou Gerstner, one of the key decisions that drove the company's resurgence was the push for its services business to be brand-agnostic. In cases where IBM hardware or software wasn't the best option for a client, the services division was free to sell products from other companies. Had IBM attempted to exclusively push its own products, clients would have almost certainly been pushed away.IBM's aggressive push into cloud computing puts the company in a similar situation. For many companies, low-cost IaaS providers like Amazon Web Services may be a better fit than IBM's SoftLayer. Or a third-party database-as-a-service provider may make more sense than IBM's in-house solutions. In those cases, IBM would lose business if it failed to offer the best solution for a client.IBM's acquisition of Gravitant late last year offered a good demonstration of IBM's cloud strategy. Gravitant is a cloud brokerage and management platform, allowing customers to compare various cloud providers based on cost and performance, and then manage their cloud infrastructure, potentially across different providers, or in a hybrid configuration, from a central location.IBM offers a few examples of this price comparison for prospective clients, and in some cases, Amazon Web Services offers the lowest price. Of course, IBM would prefer clients to choose SoftLayer, but its services business only truly works if it's able to put together the best solution possible.All cloud businesses aren't created equalIBM is not attempting to build a one-size-fits-all cloud-computing platform. The company's cloud business is big, with an annual revenue run rate of $10.8 billion; but its infrastructure-as-a-service revenue is minuscule compared to Amazon's. IBM likely will never be the largest provider of cloud infrastructure, but it doesn't have to be in order to build a successful cloud business.Regardless of the cloud provider an organization chooses, moving to the cloud, and managing cloud infrastructure is not a trivial task. The rise of cloud computing has certainly caused upheaval at IBM, but its services business is adapting. The same brand-agnostic strategy that turned the company around in the 1990s is alive and well today, helping to drive IBM's cloud transformation forward."
How Risky Is International Business Machines Corporation?,"Aug 11, 2016 at 8:41AM","Risk is inherent to any investment. The question for investors is whether the risk is manageable, and whether the stock offers enough potential upside to offset a worst-case scenario. If investors pondered those points regarding IBM (NYSE:IBM) a year or so back, the answers would be slightly different from today.When IBM committed to transforming away from enterprise hardware and PC-related solutions to an emphasis on the cloud, data analytics, cognitive computing, and security, there was no shortage of skeptics. But as its strategic imperatives gain momentum, investors have determined that IBM is worth the risk, which would explain why its stock price is up 18% this year.But like all stocks, IBM still faces challenges.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.First, the good newsIBM stock is on the rise because it's consistently delivering where it counts, and investors seem to recognize that its transformation is not just under way, but in full swing.With a recent change in financial reporting, IBM now reports its strategic-imperatives results as both unit sales and a percentage of total revenue. It's no wonder that, since Q2 2016, strategic imperatives were chugging along at an annual revenue run rate of $30.7 billion, equal to 38% of total sales.It's no surprise that IBM's cloud push is leading the way in terms of its strategic-imperatives success. As of last quarter, IBM boasted an annual run rate of $11.6 billion in cloud sales, and even more telling was its nearly 50% jump in cloud delivered as a service, to $6.7 billion. It's this area in which IBM and one of its primary competitors, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), will continue to impress.As fast and as large as the cloud market is expected to become in the years ahead, the hands-down leading driver of all that growth, excluding advertising, will be business process services and software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. Combined, the two cloud sectors will total an estimated $80.3 billion in sales this year. Coincidentally, those are both key components of IBM's -- and Microsoft's -- cloud plans.The risks aheadOne of the few cloud providers on the planet that can rival IBM is the aforementioned Microsoft, though it's hardly the only one. With so much opportunity comes competition, and competition often translates to risk. That's particularly true when the competition includes some of the tech industry's biggest players, which certainly describes the cloud market.As of last quarter, Microsoft boasted in excess of a $12.1 billion annual run rate of cloud-related sales, largely because of its SaaS offerings. Sure, its Azure cloud platform sales skyrocketed 102% last quarter and usage more than doubled, but that's merely a means to its SaaS end: Microsoft's 54% jump in Office 365 commercial sales is a testament to that.IBM also faces the not-so-small matter of increased expectations from both investors and the Street. The impressive gains across its strategic imperatives units has been the impetus behind investors rising optimism, but if there's a hiccup of any kind in future quarters, the negative reaction would be immediate and harsh, to say the least.As of last quarter, IBM was carrying over $44 billion in short- and long-term debt on its balance sheet, along with $10.6 billion in cash and equivalents. While not overly concerning for a company the size of IBM that generated free cash flow of $2.1 billion last quarter, the larger risk lies in why its debt has climbed: acquisitions.IBM has already acquired 11 companies this year totaling more than $5 billion. The upside of all those deals is they have largely been in line with IBM's strategic-imperatives initiatives. But as Microsoft knows firsthand -- thanks to its failed smartphone ambitions, which ended with more than an $8 billion write-off -- successfully incorporating new technologies and people into an established firm can be a lot easier said than done.So, how risky is IBM? Valued at just 11 times future earnings, paying a dividend of nearly 3.5%, and well on its way to implementing a successful transition, IBM has gone a long way toward minimizing the risk of investing in its stock.

IBM Aims Watson at the Financial Services Industry,"Oct 10, 2016 at 6:05PM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Artificial intelligence (AI) has become the next great buzzword in the technology industry. It seems like every tech company under the sun is embracing AI. Software giant Microsoft recently formed a new AI research group, comprised of 5,000 computer scientists and engineers, in an effort to bring AI to all of its applications and services. Cloud computing company salesforce.com, at its annual Dreamforce conference, introduced Einstein, a set of AI features that will be integrated into its platform. And carmaker Tesla has long touted its AI-driven Autopilot driver-assistance system as a key selling point for its electric cars.International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is taking a more focused approach. Watson, the company's cognitive-computing system, has been aimed at some very specific problems. In the healthcare industry, Watson is being used to improve the quality of decisions and diagnoses while freeing healthcare professionals from tedious tasks. The system can churn through a massive amount of data, including medical records, research journals, and textbooks, providing doctors with information and guidance in an effort to drive better patient outcomes.From healthcare to financeThe financial services industry is the next big target for Watson. In September, IBM announced that it planned to acquire Promontory Financial Group, a risk management and regulatory compliance consulting firm, for an undisclosed sum. Promontory's 600 professionals will train Watson to help its clients navigate an increasingly complex regulatory environment.What the healthcare industry and the financial services industry have in common is an astronomical quantity of data. According to IBM, more than 20,000 new regulatory requirements were created in 2015, and by 2020, the total catalog of regulations is expected to surpass 300 million pages. More than 10% of all operational spending at major banks, roughly $270 billion per year, is related to regulatory compliance.This high level of compliance spending represents a concrete problem that Watson aims to solve. The acquisition of Promontory accomplishes two things. First, it accelerates the process of training Watson to tackle the regulatory burden facing financial companies. Like any machine-learning system, Watson is not plug-and-play. The system needs to be specifically trained for each task, a process that requires both time and expertise.Second, it furthers IBM's transformation into a cloud and cognitive-solutions company. The rapid growth of cloud computing has forced IBM to transform itself, but the company is still focused on serving enterprise customers and solving specific problems for its clients. IBM will never be the largest cloud computing provider. Instead, the company focuses on areas where it can offer differentiated solutions and build a competitive advantage. The healthcare industry is one such area, and the financial services industry is another.One important takeaway from IBM's acquisition of Promontory is that artificial intelligence systems like Watson are nothing without highly skilled people. In the healthcare industry, Watson is a tool for doctors, not a replacement. Watson helps doctors make better decisions, but it's nowhere near the point of being able to make those decisions on its own. In the financial services industry, Watson will augment the expertise of Promontory's professionals. Again, Watson will act as a tool for better decision making.With that in mind, IBM's strategy of acquiring companies with deep knowledge in specific areas makes a lot of sense. Earlier this year, IBM announced the acquisition of Truven Health Analytics, a deal that brought with it both a massive amount of data and thousands of highly trained employees. The acquisition of Promontory fits the same mold, bringing deep knowledge in-house in an effort to apply Watson to new areas.IBM has big goals for Watson: The company has previously stated that it aims to turn the system into a $10 billion business by 2020. IBM may have been overly optimistic, but the potential for Watson to become a major source of revenue is very real. IBM has yet to disclose how much revenue Watson brings in, likely because the number is not yet very impressive. But the strategy of targeting concrete problems in specific industries, while certainly a slow process, is sound. The acquisition of Promontory is a step in the right direction.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Better Buy: Microsoft Corporation vs. IBM,"Nov 9, 2016 at 6:43PM","Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) are frequently cited as ""mature"" tech stocks that you buy for income and stability instead of growth. Both stocks have outperformed the S&P 500's 4% gain -- Microsoft is up 9% for the year, and IBM has climbed about 13%. But is either stock still worth buying today with the market near all-time highs? THE SURFACE PRO STUDIO. IMAGE SOURCE: MICROSOFT.The similarities between Microsoft and IBMAt first glance, Microsoft and IBM are very different companies. Microsoft generates most its revenue from licensing and subscription fees for Windows and Office. It generates additional revenue from sales of its Azure cloud platform Dynamics CRM, Surface hardware, Xbox consoles, and search-based ads. IBM's core business is split between business services, technology services, hardware systems, and enterprise software.But Microsoft and IBM both face two similar challenges -- slower enterprise spending, and the technological shift toward mobile and cloud-based solutions. Sluggish enterprise spending causes companies to stick with older versions of Windows and Office, and to spend less on IBM's IT services, hardware, and software. Both companies are also struggling to remain relevant in a mobile world. That's why Microsoft's revenue fell 2% last year, while IBM's top line declined 12%.Neither Microsoft nor IBM has a meaningful presence in mobile hardware, but both companies are pivoting their businesses toward higher-growth cloud solutions to offset declines in other older businesses. Microsoft's core strategy in that market revolves around growing its commercial cloud business (Office 365, Dynamics, Azure), which achieved an annual run rate of $13 billion last quarter.IBM's plan is similar -- to grow its ""strategic imperatives"" businesses (cloud, analytics, mobility, security, and social) at a faster rate than its older businesses. IBM's cloud ""as a service"" business, which can be compared to Microsoft's commercial cloud business, hit an annual run rate of $7.5 billion last quarter.IBM WATSON ELEMENT FOR EDUCATORS. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.How fast are Microsoft and IBM growing?Microsoft has posted positive single-digit annual sales growth for three consecutive quarters. IBM, however, has posted annual sales declines for 18 consecutive quarters. Looking ahead, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue to rise 2% this year, but IBM's to decline 2%. That's partly because Microsoft's business (mostly software) was easier to pivot toward higher-growth cloud businesses than IBM's complex mix of business software, hardware, and IT services.IBM slimmed down its hardware business over the past few years with the sale of its PC business, low-end servers, and its chipmaking unit. But the hardware business remains a dead weight on Big Blue's top line, causing its Systems revenue (8% of sales) to fall 21% annually last quarter. Its core business and technology services are also losing ground to nimbler rivals.Both companies rely heavily on inorganic growth to strengthen their ecosystems. Microsoft's acquired LinkedIn to gather more employer and employee data for its analytics business, and to widen Dynamics' moat against Salesforce's market-leading CRM platform. IBM has been acquiring smaller cloud, mobile, and security businesses to strengthen its strategic imperatives. Both companies have adequate cash to continue that strategy -- Microsoft generated nearly $27 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, while IBM generated over $14 billion.Dividends and buybacksMicrosoft currently pays a forward yield of 2.6%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 69%. IBM pays a higher forward yield of 3.7%, yet has a lower payout ratio of 44%. From an income investor's perspective, IBM might seem like a better pick.Microsoft spends more cash on buybacks than IBM. Over the past 12 months, it spent nearly $15 billion on buybacks, but Big Blue spent just over $3 billion. However, IBM intentionally started reducing those buybacks last year to conserve its free cash flow for investments and acquisitions in its higher-growth businesses.Profitability and valuationsMicrosoft's earnings, lifted by buybacks and its shift toward higher-margin cloud businesses, are expected to rise 6% this year. IBM's earnings are expected to fall 10% due to its ongoing sales declines, increased investments, and reduced buybacks.Microsoft currently trades at 29 times earnings, which matches the industry average of 29 for business software and services companies. IBM trades at 13 times earnings, which is lower than the industry average of 21 for IT services companies. Those metrics indicate that investors could be a bit too excited about Microsoft, while ignoring IBM's cheap valuation.The winner: IBMMicrosoft initially looks like a better buy than IBM -- it clearly has better sales and earnings growth, and its turnaround efforts are producing more visible results. But IBM's higher dividend, lower payout ratio, and lower P/E ratio indicate that it's the better pick at current prices. Microsoft has lots of growth potential -- especially with new products like HoloLens, VR headsets, and Xbox Scorpio on the way -- but I'd like to see a higher yield and a lower P/E before I start a position.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Will 2017 Be International Business Machines Corporation's Worst Year Yet?,"Dec 27, 2016 at 3:55PM","BIG BLUE'S HEADQUARTERS IN ARMONK, NY. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Investors in IBM (NYSE:IBM) have missed out on a great market rally in recent years. 2016 provided a welcome bounce, but the long-term trend is still mighty negative as Big Blue's strategic makeover continues to hurt more than it helps. Will 2017 see another deep dip?The story so farSince the start of 2012, when Ginni Rometty took over IBM's CEO office from Sam Palmisano, IBM shares have gained a meager 2% -- assuming that you reinvested all dividends along the way. On the same dividend-adjusted basis, the S&P 500 index has almost doubled:IBM TOTAL RETURN PRICE DATA BY YCHARTSIn 2016, the market roles were reversed. The market-barometer index has gained a dividend-adjusted 13% while IBM soared 26% higher.Rometty took a sharp turn in a new direction five years ago. The all-you-can-eat IT buffet that worked so well under Palmisano has been dismantled in favor of a tighter focus on IBM's most promising growth markets. Server hardware and chip manufacturing operations have been spun off and sold out. The new IBM is all about its ""strategic imperatives,"" centered on cloud computing and artificial intelligence.Drastic strategy changes tend to hurt, at least at first. This one has been going on for five years and still brings the pain on a consistent basis:IBM REVENUE (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTSAbove all else, IBM's sales have declined year over year in each of the last 16 quarters. That's enough to drive a nervous man distracted.What's next?Long story short, I don't think IBM shares are primed for a massive plunge in 2017.Sure, the 2016 momentum may run out of steam. Big Blue's refocus continues apace, and I would not be surprised to see top-line sales fall even further. But this is one of those cases where the end truly justifies the means. IBM is building an artificial intelligence monster, wrapping it in warm blankets of cloud computing delivery systems, and unleashing it to do battle in the next era of business computing.The company is starting partnerships with medical specialists, while also clearing pathways for the IBM Watson system into the Internet of Things industry. The payoff might not start in 2017, but the worst of the transformation process pain should be behind IBM shareholders.If share prices hold steady or fall back again, that only adds muscle to IBM's famously generous dividend and share buyback programs.Master investor Warren Buffett owns 8.5% of IBM these days, and he's still buying more Big Blue shares. He is clearly seeing through this bothersome period of transition and expecting great returns for the long haul.Hard to bet against this guy, isn't it?"
IBM Seals a Win-Win Cloud Deal With Workday Inc,"Aug 21, 2016 at 12:32PM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) recently announced that Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), a provider of enterprise cloud applications for finance and human resources, has adopted the IBM Cloud as its primary development and testing platform. The increased capacity gained from IBM Cloud, which has data centers in 17 countries across six continents, should help Workday accelerate its worldwide expansion.Over the course of the multi-year partnership, Workday plans to expand its use of IBM Cloud beyond development and testing purposes. Let's see how this new partnership could benefit both companies.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Why is Workday important?Workday's services enable organizations to staff, pay, and organize their workforces. Its cloud-based services also leverage analytics and machine learning to help organizations make financial and employee-related decisions. This isn't the first time IBM has partnered with Workday. Last year, IBM acquired Meteorix, one of Workday's top service partners. IBM also uses Workday's Human Capital Management service to manage its own global workforce.Partnering with Workday attaches IBM to a high-growth player in the cloud. Workday revenue rose 38% annually last quarter and is expected to climb 34% this year and another 31% next year. That's a stark contrast to its own 17 straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines.Workday is growing so rapidly, because it has carved out a niche that enterprise cloud giants like Salesforce -- which specializes in customer relationship management -- hasn't adequately addressed. That's why Salesforce integrates Workday's software into its own CRM suite.How does this deal help IBM?IBM's partnership with Workday will boost the growth of its strategic imperatives (cloud, AI, analytics, mobile, social, and security) businesses -- the high-growth segments which it hopes can offset ongoing declines in IT services, software, and hardware.Revenue from strategic imperatives rose 12% annually to $8.3 billion last quarter and accounted for 38% of IBM's top line over the past 12 months. Within that total, cloud revenue grew 30% to $3.4 billion last quarter. The annual run rate for its higher-growth ""cloud as a service"" revenue -- which includes deals with companies like Workday -- rose nearly 50% to $6.7 billion.Over the past few years, IBM has been aggressively divesting its slower-growth businesses while investing heavily in cloud acquisitions and partnerships to bolster its top line growth. Since the beginning of the year, IBM has acquired ten companies (or parts of companies) to boost its cloud and analytics capabilities. It also secured major cloud deals with Facebook, Apple, Twitter, SAP, and Tencent. Workday has a smaller market cap than all of those companies except for Twitter, but its top line is also growing the fastest.And what about Workday?Workday stock has stagnated over the past 12 months on concerns of slowing sales growth. Its 38% jump last quarter was impressive, but it also represents a slowdown from 43% growth in the previous quarter and 57% growth a year earlier. Its operating losses have also been widening, and the company's bottom line remains deep in the red.To re-accelerate its revenue growth, Workday must expand to new markets -- something that IBM Cloud can help it do. The scalable nature of IBM Cloud can help keep operating expenses under control as Workday expands.Is this a win-win deal for both companies?With this announcement, IBM gains a multi-year deal with a fast-growing niche player in the cloud, and Workday gains the ability to expand faster with potentially lower operating costs. So it's safe to call this deal a win-win situation for both companies. However, IBM will likely benefit less, since revenue from the deal will only account for a small slice of its cloud business, while Workday will gain a stronger cloud-based testing and development platform.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2 Reasons International Business Machines Stock Could Rise,"Jun 14, 2016 at 11:00AM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) have fallen about 30% since peaking in 2013. The stock has been walloped again and again by disappointing results. Revenue has declined on a year-over-year basis for 16 straight quarters, and all of the share buybacks in the world couldn't prevent IBM's earnings from dropping as well.IBM DATA BY YCHARTS.Despite the company's lackluster results in recent years, IBM remains extremely profitable. Big Blue is investing heavily in growth areas such as cloud computing and analytics, and through those efforts, the company is building the foundation for future growth. There's still a lot that can go wrong for IBM, but there are a couple of things that could drive IBM stock higher in the coming years.Lapping the currency issuesMore than half of IBM's revenue comes from overseas, and that means shifting exchange rates can have a major effect on the company's results. During the second half of 2014 and the first few months of 2015, the U.S. dollar strengthened dramatically against many foreign currencies. Here's how the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate has evolved:EURO TO U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE DATA BY YCHARTS.A strong U.S. dollar led to major declines in revenue for IBM due to currency translation. In 2015, IBM reported a 12% decline in revenue, but 8 points of that decline, or about $7 billion, was due to currency. Another 3 points was due to divestitures; adjusted for those two items, IBM's revenue declined by just 1%.The good news is that exchange rates have been more stable over the past year, and IBM has lapped the steepest changes. The bad news is that the roll-off of currency hedges this year will have a major negative impact on the company's results. IBM expects its pre-tax profit to be reduced by $1.3 billion in 2016 because of currency.These currency issues have little to do with the business itself, and once all of the currency-related losses are lapped, the company's reported and adjusted results should converge. The double-digit revenue declines of 2015, which seem to have fostered an image of a company in disrepair in the minds of investors, will be replaced with less headline-worthy performance. Part of what's holding IBM stock back is pessimism among investors. The end of the company's currency woes could flip the script and send shares higher.Winning the cloudAs I've argued in the past, IBM is not trying to become the largest cloud infrastructure provider. Amazon's AWS holds that honor at the moment -- and will for the foreseeable future. IBM's infrastructure-as-a-service business, SoftLayer, is small, around one-tenth the size of AWS. But the company's cloud strategy goes far beyond infrastructure.IBM's total cloud revenue has reached a $10.8 billion annual run rate, and its delivered-as-a-service cloud revenue run rate sits at $5.4 billion. IBM's focus is on enterprise customers, and its base of existing clients gives the company a significant advantage. IBM CFO Martin Schroeter recently stated that the company is becoming more of a services integrator rather than a systems integrator, reflecting the shift toward cloud computing, particularly hybrid cloud.IBM's cloud revenue has been growing at a rapid pace. During the first quarter of 2016, total cloud revenue rose 36% year over year, adjusted for currency, while the cloud-as-a-service annual run rate jumped 46% compared to the same period last year. Some of this growth is being driven by acquisitions, which IBM is using to build out its cloud platform and make strategic bets in areas like healthcare.As many of IBM's legacy businesses decline, the company needs to keep up the growth in its cloud business. That means signing service deals with an increasing amount of cloud content, getting developers to use Watson and other cloud services to build applications, and successfully selling clients on the benefits of a hybrid cloud setup.Ultimately, returning to growth will require IBM's growth businesses to become large enough to counteract weakness elsewhere. Once that happens, the pessimism currently baked into the stock price could become a thing of the past.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

IBM Watson Enters Self-Driving Vehicle Space Via the World’s First Autonomous Talking Electric Shuttle,"Jun 30, 2016 at 2:35PM","In mid-June, Local Motors, the leading vehicle technology integrator and creator of the world's first 3D-printed car, introduced the first self-driving vehicle to integrate the advanced cognitive computing capabilities of IBM's (NYSE:IBM) brainy Jeopardy champ Watson.Here's what you should know about the innovative electric shuttle named ""Olli.""IMAGE SOURCE: LOCAL MOTORS.Meet Olli Olli was unveiled and demonstrated during the June 16 grand opening of Local Motors' facility in National Harbor, MD, a resort destination just sound of Washington, D.C. The EV, which can carry up to 12 people, is equipped with advanced vehicle technology, including IBM Watson Internet of Things (IoT) for Automotive, to improve the passenger experience and allow natural interaction with the vehicle.Olli has been cruising public roads in D.C. at select times since its unveiling. Local Motors, which is currently producing additional Ollis at its headquarters near Phoenix, aims to have 30 vehicles on the streets of the nation's capital by Christmas, according to CEO and co-founder Jay Rogers, Jr. Public road testing of driverless autos is legal in D.C. and in eight U.S. states: California, Michigan, Florida, Nevada, Arizona, North Dakota, Tennessee, and Utah. While Olli was only recently officially introduced, cities all over the world have expressed interest in putting the smart self-driving EV to use on their public roads. Local Motors sold 10 vehicles during the grand opening. By the end of the year, there will also be Ollis in Miami, Florida; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Las Vegas, Nevada, among other unnamed cities.Olli went from concept to completion in three months, illustrating Local Motors' production speed advantage over traditional automakers. The privately held company envisions having hundreds of microfactories all over the world where it can quickly produce crowd-sourced vehicles of various types. Olli's technologyIn addition to Big Blue -- whose involvement is explored in more depth below -- Local Motors' partners for Olli include the following privately held companies: Roding: German company that assisted with digital designs and played a key role in the vehicle build.Paravan: Provided the driving system. Forward Engineering: Provided expertise in composite manufacturing.Meridian Autonomous Systems: Provided driverless vehicle software and sensor integration.GSP: Provided communications and security systems.Best Mile: Provided software for fleet management and route optimization.Icarus: Provided a digital checklist for daily operations like maintenance and service.Olli's self-driving tech is comprised of three types of sensors: lidar, optical cameras, and GPS. By comparison, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google self-driving tech uses these sensors plus ultrasonic sonar and radar, while Tesla Motors' Autopilot uses cameras, radar, sonar, and GPS, but not lidar. Lidar -- a laser-based tech -- is currently prohibitively expensive for use in mass-market passenger vehicles. This is one reason that many believe Alphabet will likely operate -- or sell to others -- a fleet of Uber-like on-demand self-driving vehicles, rather than license its proprietary tech to automakers. Many of Olli's components are 3D-printed by the company's Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM) machine, made by privately held Cincinnati Inc. Some additional specs about Olli: RANGE  City32.4 mi (58 km)POWER SYSTEMMax capacity (kWh)15Charger type3 Phase ACCharge time (220V)4.5 hoursDIMENSIONSL x W x H  12.86 ft x 6.73 ft x 8.2 ftECONOMYAverage fuel economy2.16 mi/kWh (3.48km/kWh) Typical cost to recharge$1.80 (euro 3.91)Olli marks IBM Watson's entree into self-driving vehiclesOlli is the first self-driving vehicle to integrate the IBM Watson IoT for Automotive platform, which uses the cloud-based cognitive computing capability of Watson, best known for beating the top Jeopardy champs in 2011. The platform was launched in December. Watson is often described as artificial intelligence tech, but it goes beyond AI to machine learning, which ""teaches"" a machine to learn, based on huge volumes of collected data. With Olli, Watson will analyze and learn from gads of transportation data, produced by more than 30 sensors embedded throughout the vehicle. In addition to the Internet of Things applications that will enable Olli to learn about road conditions and the like, the brainy EV will be able to learn about -- and from -- passengers who interact with it. This feature is similar to the voice-activated AI assistants of Apple (Siri), Alphabet (Google Assistant), and Amazon (Alexa), which are incorporated into various devices -- such as Amazon's Echo and Google Home -- but taken to a higher level. These big tech players, however, have been upping their involvement in machine learning, so their assistants' IQs should continue to increase.The IBM Watson IoT for Automotive platform incorporated into Olli leverages four Watson developer APIs -- including speech-to-text and text-to-speech -- to enable interactions between the vehicle and passengers. Some examples of how passengers can interact with Olli:Asking how the vehicle works.Asking why it's making specific driving decisions.Requesting personalized recommendations on local destinations such as restaurants or historical sites, which Olli provides based on an analysis of personal preferences. Watson is part of IBM's turnaround plan DATA BY YCHARTS.Big Blue's financial performance -- and thus, its stock price -- has fallen behind the leading tech pack of Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, and others in recent years. Revenue has declined for 16 consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis, which has negatively affected earnings. The vast majority of the declines, however, stem from the company's divesting legacy businesses that it's exiting, as it transitions to areas such as cloud computing and data analytics, and foreign exchange currency headwinds in 2014 and 2015. IBM is betting big that Watson will help turn things around for it. The Watson IoT platform, launched in December, is targeting the automotive, home, building, retail, and electronics industries. Watson appears to have amazing potential, though it remains to be seen how well Big Blue executes. "
International Business Machines Corp. in 6 Charts,"Aug 30, 2016 at 7:30PM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) is generally known as a slow-growth tech stock that provides a solid dividend but weak share price growth. To better understand Big Blue, here are six charts detailing the inner workings of its business.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.1. 17 quarters of revenue declinesIBM's biggest problem is its lack of top line growth. Sales fell 3% annually last quarter, marking the company's 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines due to weak enterprise spending, currency headwinds, and tough competition in the IT, software, and hardware markets.DATA BY YCHARTS.Under CEO Ginni Rometty, who took the company reins in 2012, IBM divested units that generated low-margin revenue, including consumer PCs, low-end servers, and its chip foundry, and acquired higher-growth businesses in the cloud, AI, mobile, social, and security markets.2. The five strategic imperativesIBM calls those five businesses its ""strategic imperatives"", and the combined sales from those units rose 12% annually last quarter. This chart illustrates the revenue breakdown and growth rates of these key segments:IMAGE SOURCE: IBM INVESTOR PRESENTATION (AAS = AS A SERVICE).Over the past 12 months, those five businesses generated $31 billion in revenue and accounted for 38% of the top line. However, its ""cloud as a service"" annual run rate of $6.7 billion still trails far behind that of market leader Amazon, which posted an annual run rate of $11.5 billion for its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), last quarter.3. Core businesses remain weakWhile progress with the strategic imperatives looks encouraging, those five businesses are actually woven into IBM's other business units. This means that their growth looks a lot less impressive when we consider how these overall units are faring.  2Q revenue (billions)2Q YOY sales growthStrategic Imperatives growth (within the unit)% of sales from Strategic ImperativesCognitive Solutions$4.74%9%64%Global Business Services$4.3(3%)13%53%Technology Services and Cloud Platforms$8.90%35%22%Systems$2.0(23%)(14%)45%DATA SOURCE: IBM INVESTOR PRESENTATION (YOY = YEAR-OVER-YEAR).This chart indicates that while revenue from strategic imperatives rose across all of the business units except for Systems, only the Cognitive Solutions unit (which includes the AI platform Watson) broke into positive territory overall. That's why IBM closed or announced the closure of ten different acquisitions to accelerate the growth of its strategic imperatives this year.That said, sales growth is unlikely to return to positive territory anytime soon. Analysts currently expect the company's sales to dip 2.6% this year and another 0.4% next year.4. Reduced buybacksOver the past two years, Rometty greatly reduced IBM's dependence on buybacks to inflate earnings without sales growth -- an unsustainable strategy her predecessor Sam Palmisano relied on.DATA BY YCHARTS.Previously, buybacks were funded by a combination of free cash flow and low-interest debt, so reducing them freed up more cash for investments, acquisitions, and dividends. It would also be logical to stop funding buybacks with debt as interest rates rise.5. Free cash flow and dividend growthIf we look back at IBM's free cash flow growth over the past five years, we can see the positive impact of reduced share repurchases.DATA BY YCHARTS.Over the past 12 months, IBM spent just 36% of its free cash flow on dividends, which gives it plenty of room to continue its 16 straight years of annual dividend hikes.IBM currently pays a forward yield of 3.5%. That's higher than the yield of other ""mature"" tech plays like Microsoft and Intel, which respectively pay forward yields of 2.5% and 2.9%.6. Empty calories and margin growthRometty frequently refers to IBM's divested businesses as ""empty calories"" which produced revenue without profits. However, the strategic imperatives aren't really high-margin businesses either.Fierce competition has greatly reduced prices across the cloud and mobile markets. IBM's position as the underdog also doesn't give it the pricing power of bigger platforms such as AWS or Microsoft Azure. As a result, operating margins at IBM have gradually declined over the past two years.DATA BY YCHARTS.That decline has weakened its earnings per share, which fell 27% annually last quarter with less support from share buybacks. Analysts expect IBM's earnings to fall 9.5% this year but potentially rebound 4.4% in 2017.The bottom lineIBM is still a company in transition. Its strategic imperatives are growing as a percentage of its top line, but their margins are questionable, and they continue to be weighed down by the company's legacy businesses. While the decision to reduce buybacks was wise, it also means that earnings growth will look ugly for the foreseeable future. All in all, IBM is a solid dividend stock with a fairly attractive valuation of less than 12 times full-year 2016 earnings, but I don't see it rallying anytime soon."
Here's Why the Best Is Yet to Come for International Business Machines Corporation,"Mar 31, 2017 at 10:11AM","Though describing it as a ""growth company"" would strain credulity, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) expects to return to growth in 2017, possibly putting an end to one of the more embarrassing chapters in its vaunted corporate history. In fact, IBM shares remain down significantly over the past half decade, and have lagged the broad market by roughly 90 percentage points over this period.IBM DATA BY YCHARTS.This might not make IBM seem like an appealing stock to own. However, considering its below-average valuation and its above-average dividend, there's an increasingly legitimate case to be made that IBM is one of the more appealing value investments on the market today.IBM turns the cornerShots of green finally started to show through in IBM's most recent earnings release, but investors had to squint to see them, as its results largely showed more of the same. At the surface level, IBM saw its revenues decline for a 19th consecutive quarter, albeit falling by a mere 1% compared to the year prior. However, the company's fourth-quarter profits managed to rise just 1%, which came in well ahead of analysts' consensus estimates. Its full-year 2016 GAAP net income still managed to decline 10%, though.In terms of the encouraging signs, IBM guided for its non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) to actually return to growth for the full-year 2017. Equally encouraging, sales from IBM's so-called ""strategic imperatives"" -- which consist of cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and security software -- accounted for 41% of Big Blue's total revenues for the entire year.Strategic-imperatives sales rose 13% year over year, with major subsections, like cloud computing, growing an impressive 35%. IBM is by no means firing on all cylinders, but it's certainly the best performance the company has produced in recent memory.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Time to buy Big Blue?IBM is a mature company, and growth from its strategic imperatives will by no means transform it into a growth stock overnight -- or at all. However, that isn't to say IBM doesn't offer an attractive mix of value and income that can be highly lucrative for conservative investors who still want some exposure to tech stocks today.The average analyst sees IBM's EPS nudging barely higher this year. However, analysts then expect IBM's EPS to accelerate to grow at an average annual rate of 2.5% annually for the next five years. Of course, this isn't significant growth, but it's a far cry better than the long-standing declines that have plagued the company over the past half decade. Should this come to pass, investors could also enjoy some moderate multiple expansion, as IBM currently trades at just 12 times its forward earnings.IBM's knack for maximizing shareholder returns shouldn't be overlooked here, either. In addition to the company's current 3.2% dividend yield -- which is far higher than the S&P 500's 1.9% cash payout -- IBM has been arguably one of the most active and adept practitioners of the stock buyback since the year 2000: The tech giant has spent some $108 billion buying back its own shares since the turn of the millennium.In fact, there's a case to be made that former CEO Sam Palmisano masked some of the underlying growth issues facing IBM by continually growing EPS late in his tenure almost exclusively via share repurchases. With IBM shares still cheap, though, and the market still seeming unimpressed or skeptical about the company's future prospects, current CEO Ginni Rommetty could add meaningful long-term value in a tax-efficient manner by repurchasing IBM stock on the cheap. Shareholder Warren Buffett would certainly love this tactic.At the end of the day, it might be more accurate to say that the worst appears to be behind IBM, rather than that the best is yet to come for the century-old tech stalwart. However, the company continues to make progress in its multi-year turnaround. Between this and its bottom-barrel valuation, IBM still makes for an interesting contrarian investment today."
The Worst Mistake IBM Investors Can Make Right Now,"May 15, 2017 at 2:58PM","Staying invested in IBM (NYSE:IBM) has required a lot of patience. The tech giant has posted 20 straight quarters of year-over-year sales declines, and its stock fell 25% over the past five years as the S&P 500 rallied nearly 80%.Even Warren Buffett -- who accumulated a large position in IBM as Berkshire Hathaway's first major tech stock -- recently disclosed that he had sold about 30% of his position when the stock hit $180 in February. Buffett told CNBC that he had revalued the stock ""somewhat downward,"" and warned that Big Blue was facing ""big strong competitors.""IBM CEO GINNI ROMETTY DISCUSSES WATSON IN INDIA. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.That big sale raised major red flags, and many investors followed Buffett's lead, with the stock already dropping about 5% since his disclosure. However, I believe that investors are overreacting to the news and that it could be a big mistake to sell with the herd. Let's take a look at four reasons why IBM could still make a comeback despite Buffett's big sale.1. It's a cheap stock with a high yieldIBM faces a lot of growing pains, but its stock still trades at 12 times earnings, compared to its industry average of 19. The bears might argue that discount is justified, since investors aren't expecting much growth from the company.However, IBM also pays a high forward dividend yield of 3.9%, which is supported by a low payout ratio of 46%. Furthermore, IBM has hiked that dividend annually for 22 straight years. That combination of a low P/E, a high yield, and a stable history of dividend hikes still makes it a solid play for conservative income investors.2. Its strategic imperatives are still growingIBM plans to grow its top line again by expanding its five higher-growth ""strategic imperatives"" -- cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security -- to offset the ongoing slowdowns in its legacy IT services, business software, and hardware businesses. That's a tough balancing act, but it's gradually paying off.Last quarter, IBM reported that its strategic imperatives revenue rose 12% annually to $7.8 billion, and that the businesses' trailing-12-month sales of $33.6 billion accounted for 42% of its top line. Its closely watched cloud-as-a-service revenue also achieved an annual run rate of $8.6 billion -- representing 59% growth from a year earlier. If that double-digit growth continues, IBM could eventually post positive sales growth again -- which would inevitably lift the stock.3. Poised to profit from next-gen technologiesAt first glance, IBM's cloud services look weak compared to public cloud platform giants like Amazon's AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Microsoft's Azure, which both generate much higher revenues than IBM's comparable Bluemix platform.WATSON BEING USED FOR EDUCATION PURPOSES. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.But IBM still has other cards to play. Its AI platform Watson has already been used for healthcare applications, and it's currently being expanded to the cybersecurity, telecommunications, educational, financial, and mobile app development markets. IBM is also using blockchain, a distributed ledger technology that was originally developed for bitcoin, to secure enterprise networks.Moreover, IBM is developing the first commercially available quantum computing systems, which can make forward predictions much faster than ""classical"" computers. The company is allowing anyone to run experiments or simulations with IBM's quantum computing services via the IBM Cloud. These next-gen technologies aren't quite ready for mainstream adoption yet, but they could eventually put IBM ahead of the tech curve, which would then propel the rapid growth of its strategic imperatives.4. Buying other companies could get it back on trackIBM has been divesting a lot of older businesses (like its PC, x86 servers, and chipmaking units) while acquiring new ones that strengthen its strategic imperatives. Its biggest acquisitions in recent years include SoftLayer Technologies, Trusteer, Merge Healthcare, Cleversafe, and Truven Health Analytics -- all of which cost between $1 to $2.6 billion.However, some analysts suggest that IBM could make a much bigger acquisition to get investors excited again. One common suggestion is Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), which has a growing data licensing business and an analytics partnership with IBM.CNBC's Jim Cramer recently postulated that if IBM bought Twitter -- which has an enterprise value of $11 billion -- it could use ""its ability to keep track of feedback for its customers while using the exquisite direct message function to stay in touch with those clients."" Cramer also suggested that ""in one fell swoop,"" IBM would ""become a lot more social, mobile, and cloud.""The key takeawayInvestors should remember that Buffett still owns over 50 million shares after his recent sale so the Oracle isn't completely abandoning IBM. They should also note that IBM is still a cheap stock with a high yield, and that its shares could rise quickly once its turnaround efforts pay off. Therefore, the worst mistake IBM investors can make now is to interpret Buffett's sale as a sign to completely exit the stock.Get the latest IBM stock news here.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

IBM Dividend History: Is Slowing Payout Growth a Red Flag?,"May 1, 2017 at 9:18AM","The technology sector historically was a terrible place for investors to look for dividend stocks. With so much capital needed to invest in cutting-edge products, most tech companies are stingy with their cash early on. Yet International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been a major exception to that rule, and it not only adopted dividend payout policies decades ago but also has built up an impressive track record of boosting its quarterly payments.Recently, though, IBM has run into business challenges. That hasn't stopped the company from increasing its dividends, with the most recent boost coming just in the past week. The pace of dividend growth has slowed, though, and that has some investors wondering whether they can rely on IBM dividends going forward. A closer look at IBM and its dividend history should give some clues about the tech giant's future.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.IBM's history of dividend paymentsIBM paid its first dividend in 1913, and more than a century later, IBM has made more than 400 quarterly payments to its shareholders. Early in its history, IBM's dividend steadily climbed, only falling on a per-share basis when the company did a stock split. In the 1970s and 1980s, the rise of the personal computer helped dramatically accelerate IBM's business, and the resulting gain in profits helped Big Blue boost its dividends accordingly.IBM DIVIDEND DATA BY YCHARTS.What was IBM's primary strength, however, also turned out to be a source of weakness later on. By the early 1990s, IBM was having trouble sustaining its competitive advantages. The entry of upstart players making less expensive PCs took away IBM's first-mover advantage, and the tech giant had trouble fending off new competition. Excess manufacturing capacity created substantial costs, and massive restructuring charges in the early 1990s led IBM to slash its dividend in order to recover.It took a number of years, but IBM finally figured out a path forward. Rather than focusing on the low-margin hardware business, IBM realized that it needed to look at the more lucrative prospects for creating software and offering associated services with its computer equipment. Smaller and more nimble rivals still had some advantages over IBM and its massive internal operations, because it took a while for the larger company to implement important strategic shifts. Yet in the long run, IBM succeeded in getting its stock to recover, and dividends started rising again.What's the latest on IBM dividends?In late April, IBM gave dividend investors an increase in their quarterly payout. Beginning with its next payment, investors will get $1.50 per share on a quarterly basis. That figure is 7% higher than it was before the hike, and it boosts IBM's dividend yield to roughly 3.7%. That puts the tech giant among the top-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrials. It also marked the 22nd straight year that IBM had increased its dividend.IBM's pace of dividend growth, though, has slowed recently. From 2010 to 2015, IBM consistently offered double-digit percentage increases to its quarterly payouts. But for the past couple of years, rises of 8% and 7%, respectively, suggest greater difficulty in sustaining the tech company's past dividend growth rates.It's not that IBM doesn't have the capacity to pay higher dividends. Even after the boost, what the company pays in dividends amounts to less than half of its earnings over the past 12 months, and Big Blue sees considerable growth in its bottom line in the next couple of years. However, sluggish results over the past several years has hit earnings growth, and the payout ratio has climbed from 20% to 25% throughout the early 2010s to the current percentage in the mid- to high 40s.Can IBM's dividend history remain strong?The biggest issue for IBM is its current sales slump. Big Blue has posted year-over-year declines in revenue for 20 straight quarters, and investors worry that the company's attempts to capitalize on the rise of initiatives like cloud computing and data analytics might prove insufficient to keep it on its upward course. Transformative efforts could change that, but there's still some uncertainty about how successful IBM will be in reinventing itself once again.That said, IBM has a lot invested in its dividend, and it won't be quick to make a payout cut and end its streak. Income investors can anticipate slow but steady gains in the IBM dividend until the business starts to gain more traction, at which point Big Blue might well decide to return to the more generous dividend policies it has had in the past.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why IBM Stock Gained 20% in 2016,"Jan 31, 2017 at 9:29AM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.What happenedShares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) rose 20.6% in 2016, according to data provided from S&P Global Market Intelligence. While IBM's revenue and profit slumped throughout the year, the company beat analyst estimates for both revenue and earnings every quarter, driven in part by the continued rapid growth of its strategic imperatives. A strong fourth-quarter report in January 2017 drove the stock even higher. Shares of IBM are up an additional 5.5% year to date.So whatIBM drew a line in the sand at the beginning of 2016, proclaiming that it would generate at least $13.50 in adjusted EPS for the year. It was a messy year, with one-time tax items, restructuring costs, and IP licensing income muddling the numbers. But each and every quarter, IBM performed better than analysts expected. Revenue declines moderated as currency became less of an issue, and the software business returned to growth during the second quarter.IBM DATA BY YCHARTS.IBM's strategic imperatives continued to grow quickly despite surpassing trailing-12-month revenue of $30 billion. The cloud business continued to grow fast as well, with cloud delivered-as-a-service on a $7.5 billion annual revenue run rate at the end of the third quarter, up 66% year over year. The deep pessimism that drove down the stock price in 2014 and 2015 dissipated. While the market still prices IBM at a low double-digit multiple of earnings, the stock isn't nearly as cheap as it was at the beginning of 2016.Now whatIBM surpassed its full-year guidance when it reported its fourth-quarter results in January, generating $13.59 in adjusted EPS. What's more, the company expects to grow adjusted EPS to at least $13.80 this year, despite tax headwinds. The turning point in the company's transformation has finally been reached, and a return to revenue growth shouldn't be far behind.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What to Make of Warren Buffett's Selling IBM,"May 10, 2017 at 9:15AM","When Warren Buffett first announced in 2011 that Berkshire Hathaway had invested billions in International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), it came as a surprise to many. Buffett has typically kept his distance from the technology sector, instead sticking to businesses that he understands. Technology changes quickly, and predicting which tech companies will be able to thrive far into the future is hard.But Buffett saw something in IBM. In an interview with CNBC, Buffett laid out his reasoning: ""And then we went around to all of our companies to see how their IT departments functioned and why they made the decisions they made. And I just came away with a different view of the position that IBM holds within IT departments and why they hold it and the stickiness and a whole bunch of things.""Buffett viewed IBM's vast, global customer base as a key competitive advantage, one that would allow it to thrive regardless of how technology evolved.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Fast-forward nearly six years, and Buffett has changed his tune. Before Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett announced that he had sold roughly one-third of his stake in IBM. Buffett cited tough competition, admitting that he was too optimistic when he first bought the stock. He revalued the stock ""somewhat downward,"" saying that he doesn't value it the same way anymore.What to make of Buffett's mea culpaBerkshire still owns around 50 million shares of IBM, and Buffett stated that he had stopped selling for the time being. That's good for a $7.6 billion stake, still one of Berkshire's largest. But it's clear that Buffett has lost much of his confidence in IBM.A lot has changed in the past six years. Cloud computing has gone from a buzzword to a transformative force, upending business models and forcing even the most dominant technology companies to adapt or perish. IBM has been building out its own cloud business, with a heavy focus on enterprise customers, hybrid clouds, and high-value cloud services. Cloud computing has become a big business for IBM, generating $14.6 billion of revenue over the past year.But many of if its other businesses have been shrinking. Some of this is by design; IBM has sold off major businesses, such as its x86 server business, in the past few years as it focused on growth areas, and it's been shifting resources away from businesses in declining markets. Currency has also been a major headwind, as the bulk of IBM's revenue comes from overseas. The headline numbers have exaggerated IBM's revenue decline over the past few years, but even adjusting for these factors, it's been a slow and steady decline.DATA SOURCE: IBM. CHART BY AUTHOR.Buffett was expecting IBM to perform better than it has. The company's $20 annual adjusted EPS target was abandoned in 2014 as profits began to follow revenue lower. IBM generated just $13.59 in adjusted EPS last year, far below its previous goal. Per-share earnings growth is expected to return in 2017, according to the company's guidance, but revenue is still trending downward.That still translates into a lot of profit. Adjusted net income was $13 billion last year, giving IBM adequate resources to pay a generous dividend, buy back shares, and make strategic acquisitions. Despite all the disruption, IBM is still a cash machine.But the turnaround, still far from complete, has dragged on, longer than even Warren Buffett is willing to wait. IBM's competitive advantages, while still intact, have deteriorated. IBM's big cognitive computing push, led by Watson, creates a lot of headlines. But it hasn't yet translated into growing revenues.Buffett could be wrong about being wrong. Many of IBM's initiatives are inherently long-term, taking years to bear fruit. CEO Virginia Rometty has emphasized that revenue growth for the sake of revenue growth is not the goal at IBM. Speaking at a conference in 2015, Rometty said: ""What's important is that we grow in the right areas. Tech is littered with areas that you can have high growth and make no money. That's not us.""Buffett's selling IBM isn't a reason for investors to sell, just as Buffett's buying IBM wasn't a reason to buy. The billionaire's about-face comes at a pivotal time for IBM. After years of laying the groundwork, the century-old tech company needs to prove that its dramatic transformation is leading somewhere. Earnings growth this year is a start, but investors looking for revenue growth won't wait forever. "
This Is Why IBM's Revenue Fell Short,"Apr 21, 2017 at 11:30AM","With a 2.8% drop in revenue during the first quarter, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has now reported declining revenue for 20 consecutive quarters, or half a decade. Analysts were expecting revenue to slump by a smaller 1.6%, and the miss sent shares of IBM reeling. IBM stock tumbled around 5% the day after the earnings report, knocking nearly $8 billion off the company's market capitalization.The size of the revenue decline was the big surprise, but IBM had a simple explanation for the shortfall.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Trouble closing dealsDuring IBM's conference call, CFO Martin Schroeter explained that the company had some major services deals that failed to close during the first quarter. ""We are running the hearts and lungs of our clients' businesses. And so obviously, when you run hearts and lungs, you're not running toward a 90-day schedule,"" he said.Schroeter assured investors that these delays had nothing to do with competition:There's nobody, by the way, that's in the room with you other than the client. Nobody has the breadth of capabilities that we have. So our clients move at a pace that reflects the importance of the work we do.He also explained that the delays were not driven by the macroeconomic environment, stating, ""And so the signings delays weren't -- were not at all macro-driven. This is -- these are deep, deep partnerships with our clients that require careful planning, careful execution, and they're not going to move on a 90-day cycle.""Despite the weak revenue, IBM reiterated its full-year earnings guidance. In response to an analyst question about that guidance, Schroeter said that the quarter played out ""pretty much as we expected,"" except for the delays signing a few service deals. IBM's revenue would have still declined had those deals been signed during the first quarter, but it would have been much closer to expectations.A better second halfThose delayed service deals should close at some point down the road, but one major tailwind during the second half of the year will be the upcoming mainframe refresh. It's been nine quarters since IBM last launched a major new mainframe iteration, the z13 in January 2015. The next iteration will come late in the year, according to Schroeter, providing a boost to the systems business.IBM typically sees a massive sales spike when a new mainframe is released, driven by existing customers upgrading to the new model. Sales then trail off, producing growth for a while before settling into a decline. During the first quarter of 2015, which featured the launch of the z13, mainframe sales soared 130% year over year, driving a 30% increase in overall hardware sales.This dynamic should boost IBM's revenue during the fourth quarter, assuming the new mainframe doesn't launch too late in the year. Along with higher revenue, the launch will also drive gross profit higher, and costs will decline as major development spending will then be in the rearview mirror.This boost in mainframe revenue will be fleeting, so it likely won't return IBM to sustained revenue growth. The company's growth businesses, which now account for 42% of total revenue, will need to get bigger for that to happen. Schroeter couldn't provide a timeline for when this inflection point would occur, and it may still be a while even with those growth businesses expanding at a double-digit rate.With IBM still expecting to produce at least $13.80 in adjusted EPS this year, up from $13.59 in 2016, the speed bump hit in the first quarter doesn't look like a major issue. Investors only have so much patience, though, and after five years of revenue declines, that patience may be wearing thin.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

IBM Finally Turns the Corner,"Jan 22, 2017 at 2:00PM","IMAGE SOURCE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES.After three years of slumping profits, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) expects to return to earnings growth in 2017. The tech giant reported its fourth-quarter results on Jan. 19, beating analyst estimates on all fronts and surpassing its goal of producing at least $13.50 in adjusted per-share earnings for 2016.IBM expects to produce at least $13.80 in adjusted EPS in 2017, a small but important increase. The company's strategic imperatives, which accounted for 41% of revenue during 2016, will soon make up the majority of IBM's sales. The heavy investments that IBM has made in areas like cloud computing and artificial intelligence, while knocking down profits over the past few years, are beginning to pay off. IBM's transformation is still far from over, but an important milestone has been reached.Where IBM is growingIBM generated $13.7 billion from its cloud business in 2016, up 35% compared to 2015. Cloud as a service, which includes infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service, is now at an annual revenue run rate of $8.6 billion. That's up 61% year over year.Much of this as-a-service revenue comes from software. IBM has been shifting its software business to a subscription-based model, which is one reason the software business has suffered declines in the past couple of years. IBM has now posted three consecutive quarters of year-over-year software growth, with software as a service more than offsetting declines in legacy transactional software sales. Adjusted for currency, software revenue increased in 2016.IBM's strategic imperatives are software-heavy compared to the company as a whole, which is good news because software is the most profitable part of IBM. Total strategic imperative revenue grew 14% during 2016 adjusted for currency, reaching $32.8 billion.Analytics revenue surged 9% in 2016 to $19.5 billion; mobile revenue jumped 35% to $4.1 billion; and security revenue rose 14% to $2 billion. Declines in other businesses once again led to an overall revenue decline, with 2016 revenue slumping 2%. IBM didn't provide revenue guidance for 2017, but with earnings expected to grow, revenue could potentially return to growth as well.IBM CEO Ginni Rometty summed up an important year for the company:In 2016, our strategic imperatives grew to represent more than 40 percent of our total revenue and we have established ourselves as the industry's leading cognitive solutions and cloud platform company. IBM Watson is the world's leading AI platform for business, and emerging solutions such as IBM Blockchain are enabling new levels of trust in transactions of every kind. More and more clients are choosing the IBM Cloud because of its differentiated capabilities, which are helping to transform industries, such as financial services, airlines and retail.Some concerns remainReturning to earnings growth is an important step for IBM, but the company's results make it clear that the transformation is still a work in progress. During the fourth quarter, both gross margin and pre-tax operating margin declined on a year-over-year basis in three of the four reportable segments. These declines were offset by an increase in IP and custom development income, as well as a lower tax rate.The increase in IP revenue is part of IBM's strategy to better monetize its portfolio of intellectual property. CFO Martin Schroeter explained during the company's conference call that high-value technologies that are mature and no longer a priority investment area for IBM are being licensed, generating additional revenue and extending the lifetime of the technologies.This new income stream is helping to offset slumping profitability in the rest of the business, so investors are right to question how reliable it will be. Schroeter pointed to a pipeline of deals in 2017, so presumably IP income will continue to grow. If IP income turns out to be the main driver of IBM's earnings growth in 2017, that would be a legitimate reason for concern about the company's transformation.IBM did what it needed to do. The company beat its earnings guidance for 2016 and predicted that earnings would rise in 2017. The cloud business is still growing fast, and the strategic imperatives are accounting for a greater portion of revenue each quarter. Challenges and risks remain, but it looks like Big Blue is finally turning the corner."
IBM Boosts Dividend Despite Slumping Sales,"Apr 25, 2017 at 6:39PM","International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is still struggling to reach the point where its growth businesses fully offset decreases in legacy revenue. The first quarter, results for which IBM reported last week, marked the 20th consecutive quarterly revenue decline.IBM has also extended another streak, one that should make investors happy. The company announced that it was boosting its quarterly dividend payment to $1.50 per share, a 7.1% increase that brings the dividend yield up to about 3.7%. IBM has now increased its dividend annually for 22 years in a row, and it's paid a quarterly dividend uninterrupted since 1916. Even with dividend growth slowing, IBM is a solid dividend stock that just got even better.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Slowing dividend growthOn a percentage basis, the latest dividend increase is the smallest in over a decade. IBM's earnings have declined in each of the past three years, so this shouldn't come as a surprise.YearDividend Increase20177.1%20167.7%201518.2%201415.8%201311.8%201213.3%201115.4%201018.2%DATA SOURCE: IBM. The new quarterly dividend, which comes out to $6 per share annually, will eat up 43.5% of IBM's adjusted earnings in 2017, assuming the company hits its guidance. IBM expects to produce adjusted EPS of at least $13.80 this year, up slightly from 2016.The payout ratio is a bit higher if free cash flow is used instead of earnings. IBM expects its free cash flow this year to be roughly flat compared with 2016, which would put it at about $11.6 billion, excluding receivables from its financing business. Based on the current share count, IBM will pay out about $5.65 billion in dividends during 2017, just shy of half its expected free cash flow.IBM's payout ratio has soared over the past 20 years, with a big jump in the past few years driven by slumping earnings. The company paid out less than 25% of its earnings to shareholders for much of the past two decades, allowing the dividend to grow faster than earnings. That will be more difficult going forward.IBM PAYOUT RATIO (ANNUAL) DATA BY YCHARTS.Small dividend increases will likely be the norm unless IBM can return to robust earnings growth. Adjusted earnings are expected to grow slightly this year, but it will likely take a return to revenue growth for earnings to really take off. Still, with a 3.7% dividend yield, even sluggish dividend growth makes for an attractive dividend stock.Take advantage of market pessimismShares of IBM plunged after it missed first-quarter revenue estimates, in part due to the timing of some major service deals. The story at IBM hasn't really changed, though, and now the higher dividend makes the stock even more attractive.IBM's return to revenue growth is still pending, and investors are rightfully hesitant to invest in a company that has seen sales slump for five years running. But IBM's growth businesses are expanding at a double-digit pace. Its cloud business generated nearly $14 billion of revenue in 2016, and cloud-as-a-service is at an $8.6 billion annual run rate, up 61% over the past year.With $13.80 in adjusted EPS expected this year, IBM stock trades for less than 12 times forward earnings. That's too low, in my opinion, especially considering the 3.7% dividend yield. IBM still needs to prove that its transformation can produce sustained earnings growth, and the market is unlikely to give the company credit for its turnaround until revenue starts growing again. But if you wait for the pessimism to subside, you'll miss out on a great dividend stock selling at a discount.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why IBM Corp. Fell 6% Today,"Apr 19, 2017 at 11:38AM","What happenedShares of IBM (NYSE:IBM) fell as much as 6% on Wednesday morning following the release of mixed results for the first quarter of 2017.So whatAnalysts were expecting Big Blue to report adjusted earnings of roughly $2.35 per share on revenue near $18.4 billion. The company exceeded Wall Street's bottom-line targets by a small margin, but fell $200 million short of the top-line consensus.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Now whatIBM's so-called strategic imperatives saw 13% year-over-year growth in the first quarter, and now represent 42% of the company's annual sales. That's another baby step in a multiyear strategic transformation journey, but investors were hoping for more of a giant leap. This effort to refocus IBM around cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and mobile tools is getting long in the tooth.As for the revenue miss, IBM CFO Martin Schroeter explained on the earnings call that most of that resulted from increasing currency exchange headwinds. IBM's full-year earnings and cash flow goals were unchanged in light of this report.Schroeter also said that IBMers largely agree that it's time to start reaping the rewards of the long-running turnaround effort. ""One of our focus items, as it always has been, but now the timing is right, is to get the returns for our investment,"" he said. ""If you were to poll 100 IBM executives, it's something that they would all say is now it's time to get the return."" Coming from the CFO, that's a positive statement for me. Schroeter is now on the record as saying that the bounce back from years of slower revenues and timid margins should come to an end soon.Behemoths like IBM rarely jump or plunge this much in a single day. This drop erased as much as $9 billion from IBM's market cap and took the Dow down 64 points all by its lonesome. That seems like an overreaction to slightly soft revenues, especially since the miss was balanced by strong earnings -- and paired with the rosy CFO comments mentioned above.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

5 Signs International Business Machines Corp. Needs New Management,"Mar 10, 2017 at 11:00AM","Investors who don't follow IBM's (NYSE:IBM) earnings reports might assume that Big Blue's doing well, since the stock rallied 30% over the past 12 months. However, most of that growth likely stemmed from demand for high-yielding stocks with cheap valuations in a low interest rate environment.If we look at the long-term chart, IBM's performance look less rosy. CEO Ginni Rometty took the helm back in 2012, but IBM's stock remains down 10% over the past five years. Let's take a closer look at Rometty's five biggest shortcomings to see if it's time for a new leader to take charge.IBM CEO GINNI ROMETTY. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.1. 19 straight quarters of sales declinesMany investors simply want IBM to deliver one single quarter of positive year-over-year sales growth, which it hasn't done for 19 straight quarters. That probably won't happen anytime soon -- analysts expect IBM's revenue to drop about 2% over the next two quarters.IBM attributes that weakness to slower enterprise spending, competition from smaller competitors, currency headwinds, and the fact that its five higher-growth ""strategic imperatives"" (cloud, mobile, social, security, and analytics) aren't growing fast enough to offset declines in its older hardware, software, and IT services businesses.2. Slowing growth in strategic imperativesUnder Rometty, IBM divested lower-margin ""empty calorie"" businesses and invested more heavily in businesses that fit into its strategic imperatives ecosystem. But even after acquiring nearly 50 companies (or parts of companies) since 2012, that ecosystem still isn't growing fast enough to boost IBM's top line.

IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Those numbers sound impressive, but the cloud service market has lower growth and thinner margins than the cloud platform one. The higher-growth cloud platform market -- which lends out computing power, storage, and development platforms to companies -- is dominated by Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, which hit an annual run rate of $14 billion last quarter.IBM's comparable platform, Bluemix, had an annual run rate of just $600 million in late 2015, according to Forrester Research. Even if that figure had doubled since then, IBM would remain a distant underdog in the cloud platform race.4. Its heavy dependence on IndiaIn 2013, IBM's headcount in India eclipsed its headcount in the U.S. The reason was simple -- the average pay for an IBM employee in India is about $17,000, compared to $100,000 for a senior IT specialist in the U.S.IBM brings many of its Indian employees to work on projects in the U.S. under H-1B visas. As long as those workers are paid at least $60,000 per year, IBM is exempt from laws meant to prevent companies from using H-1B visa workers to displace American workers. However, critics note that $60,000 remains well below the market rate for American IT professionals.Rometty repeatedly failed to address this imbalance, and H-1B visas are now being targeted by both Republicans and Democrats. The U.S. recently suspended the processing of premium H-1B visas, and regulations could soon be tightened further -- which would hurt the profitability of IBM's struggling IT services business.5. That hypocritical promise to create American jobsIn January, Rometty promised to hire 25,000 American workers and spend $1 billion training them over the next five years. Shortly after that annoucement, which was clearly aimed at appeasing the Trump Administration, IBM's employees and critics quickly pointed out that Rometty didn't mention that the company had been slashing ""thousands"" of jobs which were likely being sent overseas.Former IBM employees told Bloomberg that the technology services division aimed to reduce its percentage of its permanent U.S. employees from 30% to 20%, a claim which IBM called ""inaccurate."" Nonetheless, Rometty's track record indicates that IBM will likely struggle to balance its foreign and domestic interests under the spotlight of tighter regulations.Does IBM need a new leader?Rometty has already done a much better job than her predecessor, Sam Palmisano, who relied so heavily on divestments and buybacks to inflate IBM's earnings that he forgot to invest in the company's long-term growth.But Rometty still hasn't delivered any top line growth, IBM's ""high growth"" businesses aren't growing fast enough, and she's done little to address the company's addiction to cheap overseas labor.

How IBM Is Using Artificial Intelligence to Provide Cybersecurity,"Jan 13, 2017 at 7:06PM","Cybercrime is an epidemic. Consider these statistics from Checkmarx: Cybercrime is expected to cost businesses over $2 trillion annually by 2019, four times as much as 2015. In the U.S., a breach costs a company an estimated $15.4 million on average. Some hacks can be resolved in days, while others can take weeks or months.These are more than mere statistics. Real-world examples abound. In December, Yahoo! revealed the largest known security breach to date, which compromised over 1 billion accounts, only months after it reported a separate breach involving 500 million users. These intrusions could take years to resolve and cost millions of dollars. CYBERCRIME IS AN EPIDEMIC; IBM'S WATSON HAS YOUR BACK. IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.IBM (NYSE:IBM) is rolling out a new weapon in cyberdefense: its Jeopardy!-winning cognitive supercomputer Watson. So how will a game show contestant help prevent hacking? Glad you asked, but first, a little background.One of the technologies behind Watson is an artificial intelligence (AI) discipline known as deep learning. A software model of the brain is used to recreate our ability to learn. By using a massive number of examples, combined with sophisticated algorithms, the system learns to discover similarities among the examples and find differences. This results in the program mastering pattern recognition when reviewing large data sets.Teaching Watson about cybercrimeIBM WATSON IS EXPANDING ITS SECURITY PROTOCOL. IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.IBM announced earlier this year that it was partnering with eight universities in a year-long research project to provide Watson with the requisite data necessary to expand its security protocol. These universities were chosen on the strength of their cybersecurity programs. According to an IBM press release in May, the system was ""learning the nuances of security research findings and discovering patterns and evidence of cyberattacks and threats that could otherwise be missed."" Students and faculty input security data while Watson learned the peculiarities specific to cybersecurity. It planned to process up to 15,000 documents per month, building its database of threat intelligence reports, cybercrime strategies, and threat databases. And the work is paying off. IBM recently announced that 40 organizations are now part of the Watson Cyber Security beta program. This group hails from a wide array of industries including banking, healthcare, insurance, finance, travel, energy, automotive, and education.  IBM hopes that by increasing participation in the beta program, Watson will, over time, evolve into the next generation of cyberdefense.""By applying intelligent technologies like machine learning and natural language processing, Watson can help security analysts make better decisions from structured data, as well as the massive amount of unstructured data that has been dark to an organization's defenses until now,"" IBM wrote in its press release.Better detectivesMixing AI and cyber-security holds a lot of promise. MIT announced earlier this year that an AI system had achieved an 85% success rate at detecting threats. This system, called AI Squared, differed from previous attempts at using AI for cyberdefense.  Rather than simply referring all anomalies to its human counterparts, this experiment provided feedback from the analyst to the system, allowing it to learn from the input provided by its human counterparts.  This improved the system's assessments over time, increasing the accuracy of future predictions.This reduced the number of both false positives and false negatives, according to MIT. This is a quantum leap forward versus earlier outlier detection, which merely looks for anomalies that are then forwarded to a human technician for further assessment.  This video from MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory illustrates the process:Learning on their ownGOOGLE NEURAL NETWORKS CREATED THEIR OWN ENCRYPTION! IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAYIBM isn't the only player in this emerging field. While many big tech companies use varying degrees of artificial intelligence to help provide security for their cloud-computing operations, some are taking it to another level. In a research paper, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) division Google revealed that two neural networks had learned to build their own form of encryption, while a third was unable to crack that code. This is significant because they weren't taught about encryption or given any examples of encrypted and decrypted messages. Two neural networks were instructed to send communications to each other, and keep that information secret from the third. This is likely an early development toward a dynamic system that learns to protect itself. In its conclusion, the paper states: ""Finally, neural networks may be useful not only for cryptographic protections but also for attacks.""With its massive data centers and cloud infrastructure, this development could further enhance Google's business and advance its already impressive AI credentials.The Foolish final wordIBM has been leveraging Watson in a variety of ways. In adding cybersecurity to its resume, IBM hopes to capitalize on the inability of companies to keep pace with the growing threat posed by cybercrime. Sandy Bird, chief technology officer of IBM Security was quoted as saying in a press release:Customers are in the early stages of implementing cognitive security technologies. Our research suggests this adoption will increase threefold over the next three years, as tools like Watson for Cyber Security mature and become pervasive in security operations centers. Currently, only seven percent of security professionals claim to be using cognitive solutions.If Watson can capture just a portion of that threefold increase, its training has not been in vain."
How Sustainable is IBM's Dividend?,"May 10, 2017 at 6:55PM","There isn't much positive news about IBM (NYSE:IBM) these days. Most recent headlines focus on Big Blue's 20th straight quarter of year-over-year sales declines or Warren Buffett's recent decision to sell about 30% of his shares. The stock has shed over a fourth of its value over the past five years -- a period in which the S&P 500 surged 75%.But one key strength which keeps investors coming back is IBM's forward dividend yield of 3.9%, which is nearly double the S&P 500's current yield of 2%. That high yield, combined with a low P/E of 13 (compared to its industry average of 19), makes Big Blue look like a solid income play at current levels despite its lackluster growth.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.But just how sustainable is IBM's dividend? To find out, let's examine the history of that dividend, its payout ratios, and the bottom line challenges Big Blue will face in the future.Not a dividend aristocrat... yetWhen a company raises its dividend annually for 25 straight years, it becomes an elite ""dividend aristocrat"", one of a group of stocks often favored by income investors. IBM is approaching that threshold with 22 straight years of dividend hikes. The company has also continually paid out dividends annually for over a century -- so that dividend won't fade away anytime soon.Payout ratiosThe easiest way to see if a company's dividend is sustainable is to check its payout ratio -- the percentage of its earnings or free cash flow which is spent on dividends. If either of those figures exceeds 100%, the dividend will likely be cut.Over the past year, IBM spent 46% of its earnings and 47% of its free cash flow on dividends. Those low figures indicate that it still has plenty of room to raise its dividends. However, investors should still keep a close eye on IBM's cash flow -- which has been declining over the past few years due to its slowing growth and growing dependence on acquisitions.SOURCE: YCHARTSRevenue and earnings growthIBM's top line growth has slowed down due to sluggish demand for its aging IT services, hardware, and software products. The company is trying to offset that slowdown by expanding five ""strategic imperatives"" (cloud, mobile, analytics, security, and social), but that growth still isn't strong enough to give Big Blue a top line gain. That's why Wall Street still expects IBM's revenue to drop 2% this year and stay roughly flat next year.IBM's bottom line growth looks slightly better, due to buybacks, divestments of lower-margin businesses, various cost cutting strategies, and layoffs. As a result, analysts expect its earnings to improve 1% this year and 2% next year.The catalysts and challengesLooking ahead, IBM hopes that newer cloud-based services -- like the Watson AI platform and BlueMix cloud platform -- will help it catch up to public cloud platform leaders like Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure.Amazon's AWS is the 800-pound gorilla in that market, with an annual run rate of nearly $15 billion. Microsoft doesn't disclose its exact revenue figures for Azure, but it reported that sales nearly doubled annually last quarter. Microsoft's total commercial cloud revenue (including SaaS products like Office 365 and Dynamics CRM) reached a run rate of over $15 billion at the end of the that quarter.IBM claimed that its total cloud revenues (including public, hybrid, and private solutions) reached an annual run rate of $14.6 billion last quarter. It also noted that its strategic imperatives revenue accounted for 42% of its top line over the past 12 months. But as I already mentioned, that growth simply isn't enough to offset its weaker businesses yet. As a result, many analysts expect IBM to make additional acquisitions to strengthen those businesses as it divests weaker ones.So how sustainable is Big Blue's dividend?IBM's growth might remain stagnant for at least another two years, but I believe that its steady earnings growth and low payout ratios still make it a very dependable income play for long-term investors. The stock's weak performance over the past few years is worrisome, but its low P/E should set a floor under the stock until the company's multi-year turnaround finally bears fruit."
IBM Stock Split: Will 2017 Finally Be the Year Shareholders Get a Split?,"Jan 6, 2017 at 9:26AM","Technology has developed in leaps and bounds over the decades, and Dow component International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been one of the biggest contributors to those technological advances throughout its long history. With the development of the personal computer, IBM created a new wave of rising productivity that spread throughout the business world, and more recently, Big Blue has worked to develop greater expertise in software and services to go with its legendary hardware prowess. Yet investors in IBM haven't seen a stock split since 1999, and some think the company is overdue to split its shares. Let's take a closer look at IBM and see whether 2017 might finally be the year that investors get what they've wanted for so long.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.IBM stock splits in the pastHere are the dates and split ratios for the stock splits that IBM has done in the past:Date of SplitSplit RatioDec. 1, 19256 for 5Feb. 16, 19263 for 1Jan. 16, 19465 for 4Jan. 23, 19487 for 4May 7, 19545 for 4May 4, 19565 for 4May 7, 19572 for 1May 5, 19593 for 2May 5, 19613 for 2May 5, 19645 for 4May 3, 19663 for 2May 9, 19682 for 1May 10, 19735 for 4May 10, 19794 for 1May 9, 19972 for 1May 10, 19992 for 1DATA SOURCE: IBM INVESTOR RELATIONS. NOTE: OMITS A NUMBER OF STOCK DIVIDENDS IN THE 2% TO 5% RANGE BETWEEN 1928 AND 1967.As you can see, IBM has a long history of stock splits. Throughout much of its early history, moves were gradual, with split ratios that didn't have a huge impact on stock price. More recently, though, splits in the past 40 years have become much less common, but they've also come with more typical split ratios of two for one or greater.What's particularly noteworthy about IBM is that it has never been afraid of having a high share price. For instance, in the early 1970s, IBM's share price routinely traded in the $200 to $450 range, and the company's decision to do a stock split in 1973 still left the post-split price at more than $300 per share.Yet in 1979, IBM started to follow a course that was more typical among stocks at the time. The company's 4-for-1 split that year took IBM stock back into double-digit prices, and shares traded below $75 following the move. With adverse market conditions ensuing, IBM shares didn't break back into triple digits until 1983, as the rise of the personal computer started to lift Big Blue's prospects. For the rest of the 1980s, IBM traded well above the $100 per share mark.However, IBM struggled in the 1990s. As the rest of the technology industry was making cutting-edge innovations, IBM was slow to respond to new competitive pressures. Its share price was cut in half, making splits completely unnecessary. Only once new management took over and started transforming the business to join the new networking revolution did IBM start climbing again. By 1997, the stock climbed to nearly $180 per share, and that was enough to spur the company to do a 2-for-1 split to bring the share price briefly back into double digits.The tech boom then grabbed IBM by the horns. In the space of less than two years, the stock jumped to nearly $250 per share. Only then did IBM do another split, and it was another 2-for-1 move, leaving the post-split price well in the triple-digit range.Why IBM stopped splitting its sharesFollowing that success, IBM suddenly found itself a victim of the tech bust. Shares fell from 2000 to 2002, and Big Blue had to work hard to regain its competitive position in the space. Even when other tech companies started to rebound more sharply, IBM stock remained in the doldrums, and it wasn't until 2007 that the company once again pushed above the $100-per-share mark. After a brief drop during the financial crisis, Big Blue stayed in triple digits for good in late 2009.Yet after climbing above $200 at various points in 2012 and 2013, IBM still didn't do a stock split. That move wasn't unprecedented, given IBM's history, and it also reflected changes in the way that tech companies in particular viewed stock splits. Many up-and-coming tech companies eschewed splits entirely, letting their share prices climb toward the $1,000 mark and beyond as a sign of their long-term success. For IBM, this represented a return to its mid-20th century practice of maintaining high share prices, and it hasn't been in any hurry to make moves ever since.Why IBM probably won't split its shares in 2017Right now, IBM shares trade in the $160s, and that's even down substantially from its recent highs. A dividend yield approaching 4% will also act as a headwind against share-price appreciation in the future. With a long-term strategic makeover for Big Blue still taking place, investors should probably look beyond 2017 before they can expect enough of an advance to justify IBM's next stock split.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is Management Really to Blame for IBM's Woes?,"May 27, 2017 at 2:00PM","Back in March, I discussed five reasons that IBM (NYSE:IBM) could benefit from a change in management. I noted that its revenue declines wouldn't end anytime soon, that the growth of its key ""strategic imperatives"" was slowing down, that it remained an underdog in the cloud race, that it was too dependent on outsourcing, and that it wasn't being upfront about its layoffs.While those are still valid points, we should acknowledge that Ginni Rometty was dealt a tough hand when she became the company's ninth CEO in 2012. So today, we'll examine some of Rometty's biggest moves, and whether or not they actually moved IBM in the right direction.IBM CEO GINNI ROMETTY. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Paying for Palmisano's mistakesFormer CEO Sam Palmisano -- who led IBM from 2002 to 2011 -- arguably set the company on the wrong path in 2010, when he boldly promised to double its annual earnings per share from $10.01 in 2009 to $20 by 2015. That proclamation was so impressive that Warren Buffett, who famously avoided tech stocks, made it one of Berkshire Hathaway's top holdings.The problem was that Palmisano's ""Roadmap 2015"" plan mainly consisted of selling big business units (like its PC business, which it sold to Lenovo in 2004), aggressively cutting costs, and repurchasing stock. That conservative strategy boosted IBM's earnings but caused it to fall behind the tech curve as rival companies -- like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google -- invested heavily in cloud-based platforms.Abandoning Roadmap 2015When Rometty took over, she initially followed Palmisano's playbook by cutting costs, laying off employees, and dumping lower-margin business units. The company even paid GlobalFoundries $1.5 billion to take over its money-losing chipmaking business, and its debt levels surged as it funded more buybacks with debt.But in late 2014, Rometty wisely abandoned Palmisano's $20 per share target. This decision finally gave Rometty the freedom to pursue more acquisitions in the higher-growth cloud and mobility markets.Laying down the foundations of its ""strategic imperatives""Even before she scrapped Roadmap 2015, Rometty realized that IBM had fallen far behind Amazon, Microsoft, and Google in public cloud platforms -- which lend out storage space, computing power, and development tools to companies and developers.That's why Rometty had IBM acquire cloud infrastructure giant SoftLayer Technologies for $2 billion in 2013. She followed that purchase with dozens of other takeovers of businesses in the cloud, analytics, mobility, security, and social industries -- the five pillars of growth which became IBM's ""strategic imperatives"".Revenue from those businesses rose 12% annually last quarter and accounted for 42% of IBM's top line over the past 12 months. Without Rometty's guidance, this new category of higher-growth businesses might not even exist.Investing in next-gen technologiesRometty also created dedicated business units for next-gen technologies. In 2014, IBM created a new unit for its AI platform Watson, which may help it counter similar AI efforts at Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, and Google's Cloud Machine Learning Service.The following year, IBM launched dedicated units for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Education markets -- which expanded its big data and analytics reach into both industries. It also launched Watson Health, a dedicated unit for gathering and analyzing healthcare records from millions of devices. The company is also currently expanding its presence in the cybersecurity, quantum computing, and blockchain markets -- which could widen its moat against its biggest rivals.Halting the buybacksAfter abandoning Palmisano's plan, Rometty finally weaned IBM off its addiction to debt-fueled buybacks, as seen in the following chart:SOURCE: YCHARTSThis bold move caused IBM's annual earnings to drop 10% in 2015 and 9% in 2016, but those declines were arguably necessary to allow the pursuit of other investments and acquisitions. Looking ahead, analysts expect IBM's cost-cutting plans, stabilizing (albeit stagnant) revenues, and investments in higher-margin businesses to lift its earnings by 1% this year and 2% next year.So should investors blame the management?Shares of IBM have declined 8% this year, while the S&P 500 has gained 8%. The reasons are easy to see -- the company's revenue has fallen annually for 20 straight quarters, Warren Buffett sold about 30% of Berkshire's stake in February, and Moody's downgraded its credit rating in early May.Amid all those negative headlines, it's easy to blame IBM's management for its current woes. However, it makes more sense to blame former CEO Sam Palmisano for most of those problems. Rometty initially waited too long to abandon Palmisano's quixotic plan, but her moves over the past three years indicate that she knows how to turn around the aging company. Therefore, investors should keep those facts in mind before assuming that IBM would fare better under new management.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What IBM Needs to Do on Thursday,"Jan 17, 2017 at 12:00PM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) surged 20% in 2016, bouncing off a multiyear low as the company made progress transforming itself into a cloud and cognitive computing powerhouse. Revenue and profit are still in decline, with rapid growth in areas like analytics and cloud computing unable to fully offset slumping legacy businesses. But the market is no longer intensely pessimistic on the century-old tech giant.IBM will report its fourth-quarter results on Thursday, Jan. 19, after the market closes. The company has managed to beat analyst estimates for both revenue and earnings for four quarters in a row, although one-time items were sometimes responsible. IBM has been persistent in reiterating its guidance of at least $13.50 in adjusted EPS in 2016. We'll know on Thursday whether it hit its target.More important than IBM's fourth-quarter results will be its guidance for 2017. Revenue has been declining for the better part of five years, and 2016 will mark the third consecutive year of contracting adjusted EPS, despite billions spent on share buybacks. It was never going to be quick or easy to transform IBM, but the market is now expecting a return to growth sooner rather than later.As an IBM shareholder, here's what I want to see on Thursday.IBM DATA BY YCHARTS.A solid fourth quarterIBM will need to produce about $4.91 in per-share adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter in order to hit its guidance of at least $13.50 for the full year. This actually represents growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, but IBM's earnings have become more back loaded. Various headwinds that knocked down earnings during the first half, including the mainframe business, acquisitions, and the ramping of the as-a-service businesses, are expected to moderate during the second half, easing the pressure on IBM's bottom line.IBM's software business, which spans growth areas like cloud and cognitive computing as well as legacy transactional software, has posted year-over-year growth for two quarters in a row. This comes after nearly two years of declines, and is being driven by a major pickup in annuity software sales. Software is the most profitable part of IBM, so a return to growth in the software business could foretell a return to growth for the company as a whole.IBM doesn't need to hit it out of the park on Thursday, but it does need to hit its guidance. Any shortfall could quickly wipe out last year's stock gains.A return to growth in 2017Analysts are expecting a return to growth this year, with the average estimate for adjusted EPS currently at $13.79. How accurate this turns out to be is anyone's guess. Changes in currency exchange rates knocked down the company's earnings in 2015 and 2016, and it's impossible to predict what 2017 will bring on that front. The potential trade policies of the Trump administration are another wild card, with IBM operating in nearly every major country.Excluding the things that are largely out of IBM's control, the company seemed to gain momentum in 2016 that could help propel it back to growth this year. IBM's strategic imperatives, which now account for around 40% of total revenue, are still growing at a double-digit pace. With these businesses more software-heavy than IBM as a whole, earnings have the potential to grow faster than revenue.The cloud business is growing even faster. Cloud as-a-service, which includes infrastructure-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, and software-as-a-service, reached an annual revenue run rate of $7.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 65% year over year. With total software sales growing again, the initial pain of shifting to a software-as-a-service business model, which can push revenue recognition into future, now seems to be over.If IBM guides for another earnings decline in 2017, investors will no doubt be disappointed. Analysts are mixed on IBM's prospects: Morgan Stanley and Stifel recently boosted their price targets on IBM stock, while Credit Suisse warned of a potential 30% decline in the stock price this year if the company's guidance is weak. Lackluster guidance could certainly wipe out last year's gains and then some.Strong guidance, on the other hand, could send the stock soaring. IBM stock trades for less than 12.5 times 2016 earnings guidance, a multiple that bakes in little growth going forward. If IBM can prove that its bottom line is finally turning the corner, 2017 could be another great year for the stock.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

5 Key Quotes IBM Investors Need to See,"Jan 24, 2017 at 7:09PM","IMAGE SOURCE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES.After years of revenue and profit declines, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) expects 2017 to be a turning point. The company's guidance calls for the first earnings increase since 2013, and with its growth businesses close to accounting for half of total revenue, a return to revenue growth shouldn't be far behind.IBM CFO Martin Schroeter broke down the company's results during the quarterly conference call, providing additional details for investors. Here are five quotes investors need to see.IBM's AI advantageWatson, IBM's cognitive computing system, has been the face of the company's artificial intelligence efforts for years. While other companies are focusing on building virtual assistants, such as Amazon.com's Alexa or Microsoft's Cortana, IBM is putting its efforts into solving problems for its enterprise customers. Schroeter explains:We're moving into a new phase. The debate about whether artificial intelligence is real is over, and we're getting to work to solve real business problems. As we move into this new era, it's important to understand what enterprise clients are looking for. They need a cognitive platform that turns vast amounts of data into insights, and allows them to use it for competitive advantage. They need access to a cloud platform not only for the capability, but for speed and agility. And they need a partner they trust, and who understands their industry work and process flows.IBM is building solutions for specific industries, such as healthcare and financial services. Acquisitions in those areas have built up IBM's industry expertise and data sets, allowing the company to better understand the needs of its clients. Watson Health, for example, has 7,000 employees, including doctors, nurses, and data scientists. This deep focus on using Watson to solve specific problems, coupled with IBM's vast base of existing enterprise customers, makes the company a potent force in the world of A.I.A new source of incomeOne reason IBM was able to hit its guidance for earnings in 2016 was a significant increase in intellectual property and custom development income. This shows up as a reduction in expenses on the income statement, totaling $521 million during the fourth quarter and $1.6 billion for the full year. That's up 170% and 140%, respectively. Schroeter explains the increase:Our expense dynamics also reflect the success we've had in rebuilding our intellectual property income base through IP partnerships. This is a model we've developed for some of our high value technologies that are more mature, but not necessarily in a priority investment area for us. So it made sense to work with partners who will invest and build businesses around some of these software assets. It's good for them and it's good for IBM.Profitability deteriorated in most of IBM's reportable segments during 2016, with this IP income helping to offset those declines. IP income is expected to remain significant this year, with Schroeter pointing to a pipeline of deals for 2017. But IBM will need to stabilize and grow its segment margins to successfully return to earnings growth.Watson is picking up steamIBM's Watson exists in many forms, ranging from versions created for specific applications to a variety of services available through IBM's cloud platform. The company hasn't disclosed how much revenue Watson is bringing in, but Schoeter did point out that usage has been growing rapidly:Our Watson platform, which underpins our cognitive strategy, continues to gain momentum in the marketplace. Natural language processing has long been at the core of Watson. Last quarter, we added new cognitive capabilities for conversation and the demand has been strong. We've seen significant growth in our API calls this year, especially around conversational services, where API calls increased 50 fold year to year.Without absolute numbers, it's impossible to say how big of a business Watson has become. A slew of partnerships and initiatives have been announced in the past few months alone, and late last year IBM CEO Ginni Rometty predicted that 1 billion people would be using Watson, either directly or indirectly, by 2018. It's clear that Watson is gaining momentum, but investors remain in the dark regarding the details.Mainframes are alive and kickingWhile IBM has sold off various parts of its hardware business over the years, the mainframe business continues to be a source of profits for the company. The last major mainframe refresh came in early 2015, but IBM is still picking up new clients:Eight quarters into the cycle, we added eight new clients in the quarter, 29 for the year and 80 since inception. New client adoption at this stage in our cycle further validates our clients' perceived value and their ongoing commitment to the IBM platform. Clients are investing heavily to meet the demands for future growth.IBM will be due to refresh its mainframe product line sometime this year, but Schroeter pointed out that this won't have any impact on the company's financials until late in the year. Still, a new mainframe could help IBM hit its earnings guidance in 2017.A return to revenue growth is coming soonWith IBM's strategic imperatives still growing at a double-digit rate, the point when these new businesses more than offset declines in the legacy businesses shouldn't be too far away. Schroeter said in response to an analyst's question that pre-tax margin expansion is the focus this year, but that IBM was closing in on that crossover point:And our margins in the strategic imperatives continue to be higher than overall IBM and higher obviously than the core, so our focus on delivering value hasn't changed. And whenever that crossover point happens to be, yes, we're already close. So when you say wouldn't it imply, yes, we're close, we were close in the fourth. But we're focused on delivering value, and for 2017 we're focused on obviously PTI margin expansion.IBM's revenue has declined for 19 quarters in a row, in part because of divestitures and a strong U.S. dollar. Returning to earnings growth this year is an important step, but IBM will need to return to revenue growth to convince the market that its turnaround is for real."
3 Examples of the Potential in IBM's Watson,"Feb 16, 2017 at 10:23AM","The face of International Business Machines' (NYSE:IBM) transformation is Watson. Bursting onto the scene in 2011 by winning a game of Jeopardy!, IBM's cognitive computing system is now being used in a wide variety of industries to boost efficiency and cut costs. The company predicts that 1 billion people will use Watson, either directly or indirectly, by the end of 2017.There have been many Watson-related deals and partnerships announced in recent months, and the pace seems to be accelerating. Here are three ways Watson is being used today that speak volumes about its future potential.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Tax preparationWatson is well suited for applications that involve a large amount of unstructured data. There are 74,000 pages in the federal tax code and thousands of changes each year, making the tax preparation industry ripe for an injection of IBM's flavor of artificial intelligence (AI).IBM announced on Feb. 1 that it had teamed up with tax preparation company H&R Block to bring Watson into the world of 1040s and W-2s. Watson has already been trained and validated, and is being used by some of H&R Block's tax professionals at locations across the country to ensure that no deduction is missed. The rollout is expected to continue over the next few years as Watson improves with more data.IBM made a big push into financial services last year with its acquisition of Promontory Financial Group, a risk management and regulatory compliance consulting firm. As with tax prep, the financial regulatory landscape involves a massive amount of unstructured data -- 300 million pages by 2020, according to IBM. With over 10% of operational spending at major banks going toward compliance, Watson has the potential to make the industry far more efficient.The H&R Block deal is small on its own, but it represents a new application for Watson and a stepping stone into other areas in the financial services industry.Smart elevatorsIBM struck a deal with KONE, an elevator and escalator company, last year to provide cloud-based Internet of Things services. KONE manages millions of elevators and escalators worldwide, which produce vast amounts of data from embedded sensors. That data is now sent to IBM's cloud, where Watson churns through it and helps predict problems before they become outages.You can watch the conversation between a few of KONE's elevators and the IBM cloud on KONE's website. Here's one in Illinois. It gives a good idea of the kind of information that's exchanged. Temperature, humidity, landing accuracy, speed, the length of time the door was open, and the amount of bounce upon arriving at a floor are all measured and sent to Watson for analysis. Anything out of the ordinary can be checked out before it escalates into a more serious problem.It's not hard to imagine Watson being used to monitor all kinds of equipment beyond elevators, reducing maintenance costs and downtime. I suspect that the KONE elevator deal is just the beginning.Customer supportIBM's vast customer base gives the company a major advantage as it transforms itself into a cloud and cognitive computing company. More than 225 local and state governments use IBM's mainframes to support various government functions, and those relationships that IBM has built over decades give the company an edge.IBM recently won a $24 million contract to revamp New York City's 311 service using Watson. The company will build a new system supporting multiple communications channels, with Watson helping callers get exactly the information that they need. The system will replace a 15-year-old Oracle system that was originally designed to handle only phone calls and requires $1.5 million of maintenance spending each year.Watson could potentially augment any customer support system, providing relevant answers, saving customers time, and lowering costs. Like the two deals above, the NYC 311 deal is small in the grand scheme of things. But it provides a glimpse of the future potential of IBM's cognitive computing system.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is Warren Buffett Losing Faith in IBM?,"May 9, 2017 at 10:00AM","Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) (NYSE:BRK-A), is one of the world's best-known investors, and investors devour the company's annual letter to shareholders seeking to benefit from his investing acumen. Berkshire's shareholder meeting has been called the ""Woodstock of Capitalism,"" and its annual meeting is one of the largest of its kind. Attendance was down about 10% in 2016 from the record 44,000 that attended in 2015, but that only meant thousands more watched a live-stream of the event.When this legendary investor speaks, investors tend to listen. To that end, Buffett revealed to CNBC on Friday that he sold shares in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)""I wouldn't say the specific earnings disappointed me, but I would say that I don't value IBM the same way that I did six years ago, when I started buying,"" Buffett told CNBC. ""I've revalued it somewhat downward. As a matter of fact, when it got up over $180, we actually sold a reasonable amount of the stock ... about 30%."" IS BUYING IBM LIKE BURNING MONEY? IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.HTTPS://PIXABAY.COM/EN/BURNING-MONEY-DOLLARS-CASH-FLAME-2113914/Falling revenueHe indicated that most of the stock was sold in the first quarter and some in the second quarter. That appears to have been a prescient move by the Oracle of Omaha: In its most recent quarter, IBM reported revenue that fell 2% year over year, to $18.16 billion from $18.68 billion in the prior year quarter, while also missing investors' expectations of $18.39 billion.This marked the 20th consecutive quarter of falling revenue as the company's legacy businesses continued to stagnate. Earnings per share, while beating expectations, have also been falling since peaking in 2013.IBM has been counting on newer businesses in cognitive and cloud computing to drive growth, but that growth has been slow to materialize. These new areas, which IBM refers to as strategic imperatives, grew 12% over the prior-year quarter, now accounting for 42% of the company's revenue. However, they haven't grown quickly enough to offset falling revenue in the legacy portion of the company's sales.Why the big sale?When asked why he sold 30% of Berkshire's stake in IBM, Buffett acknowledged the slow progress in the company's turnaround and the competition in the area:It hasn't done what, five or six years ago, I expected would happen or what the management expected would happen. If you look back to what they were projecting and how they thought the business would develop ... they've run into some pretty tough competitors. ... [T]he earnings have been obviously disappointing ... and I don't think the quality of earnings has improved. He specifically mentioned the cloud business, though IBM claims to have taken the crown as the global leader in enterprise cloud, with $3.5 billion in revenue from that segment in its most recent quarter. Investor takeawayThe biggest question investors will be asking is If Buffett's selling, should they follow suit? Berkshire has held its investment in IBM for more than five years, and Buffett has revisited its investment thesis. The shares were sold near their recent high, and Buffett mentioned selling the shares with the highest cost basis to harvest tax losses.It's important to note that he did keep the remaining 70% of the shares, and he said ""I don't think we'll be selling"" when asked.Time will tell whether IBM will be successful with its transition. Berkshire owned just over 81 million shares of IBM stock at the end of 2016 and still owns an estimated 56 million to 57 million shares. While he may be losing faith, he still owns an estimated 6% of the company, which speaks volumes."
3 IBM Moonshots Shareholders Should Know About,"Mar 16, 2017 at 10:07PM","Who knew that a company as big and well-known as IBM (NYSE:IBM) could become a battleground stock? In the span of a day, two sell-side analysts gave two starkly different takes on the company. Jefferies analyst James Kisner reiterated his underperform rating on the company, with a price target of $125, while Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White raised his target to an outperform and a whopping $215. The stock currently trades near the midpoint of the two, at $180 per share and 14.5 times earnings. This seems to be par for the course for IBM, with investing greats such as Warren Buffett and Stanley Druckenmiller taking similarly divergent stances, with Buffett long and Druckenmiller short.The divergence seems to be on the topic of IBM's ""moonshot"" bets. Most know the company has had declining revenues for roughly 19 straight quarters, though some of the decline came from the the company divesting unprofitable business units, such as semiconductor manufacturing. In addition, even its existing cash cows are declining as well, as the company was late to the cloud-computing game, now dominated by Amazon.com and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). This is the crux of the bears' case.IBM is not standing still, however; it has been aggressively investing in new technologies and buying companies in ""bolt-on"" acquisitions around these new bets. One need to look no further than the recent numbers from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which show that IBM was granted the most patents in the U.S. in 2016...for the 24th year in a row. It's clear that pioneering new technologies is part of the company's DNA, and bulls have faith that some, or maybe all, of these new bets could lead to big payoffs in the future. Three big bets to watch out for are Watson, blockchain, and quantum computing.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.WatsonOne could say that Watson is the most mature of the big bets, though it is difficult to get a grasp on how much revenue the segment generates. The unit is grouped within the ""strategic imperatives"" unit of the company, which exceeded $32 billion and made up more than 40% of the company's revenue in 2016. Such a contribution to revenues was ahead of schedule, according to CEO Ginni Rometty.Many first got to know Watson in 2011, when it beat a couple of us ""humans"" on Jeopardy! in 2011, showing America that artificial intelligence was not just the stuff of Stanley Kubrick movies anymore.Since then, IBM has developed Watson by purchasing companies such as Truven Health Analytics for healthcare, Promontory Financial Group for financial services regulation, and The Weather Company for (you guessed it) weather, specifically for applications for the Internet of Things. With these acquisitions, the company claims, it is obtaining valuable industry data that is not public, plus the best practices and expertise that come from the employees of these companies.IBM has a plan to differentiate Watson from all of the other AI platforms out there. Rometty explained that 80% of all data is non-public , which means that those who own the data -- the companies that collect it -- value it highly. IBM is promising these companies that in exchange for feeding their data into Watson, IBM will let them keep their insights private.According to Rometty at Monday's investor presentation, Watson will touch a billion people by the end of this year. She also threw out a $2 trillion number -- that's with a ""t"" -- as the market for enhanced decision-making via machine learning. There have certainly been a lot of Watson-related headlines these days, with new partnerships with H&R Block (NYSE:HRB), which is using financial-industry data for its clients; salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), which noted that its partnership was to make partial use of Watson's weather-related insights for insurance clients; and the Health Transformation Alliance, a nonprofit alliance of twenty large American employers, which will use Watson to help bring down the consortium's healthcare costs.BlockchainWhile many had Bitcoin fever a few years ago when the digital currency made waves on the internet, IBM saw potential in its underlying technology, called the blockchain.As featured in a recent New York Times article, IBM is working with Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT), Danish company Maersk (NASDAQOTH:AMKBF), and almost four hundred other companies in testing out this implementation of the technology.Blockchain uses high-powered computers and advanced math to note transactions between two parties, and does so in a way that makes alteration of the records after the fact impossible. As one can imagine, IBM is looking to implement this for financial institutions in recording trades. But companies that ship products around the world like Wal-Mart and Maersk can benefit, too. According to the article, when these companies ship containers, each container may require up to thirty approvals from various inspectors and customs officials. The system is also prone to fraud. A successful implementation of blockchain technology could help with that, leading to large savings for these shipping companies.One thing to watch out for, says the article, is that some large companies are reluctant to make IBM Blockchain the de facto standard, as it might lock them into IBM's ecosystem. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), for instance, is working with Microsoft on its own blockchain technology called Ethereum.Quantum computingPerhaps the most far-out moonshot -- in terms of both time and coolness -- is IBM's foray into quantum computing. Quantum computers can process information that regular computers can't. Whereas the most powerful computers today can come up with solutions based on currently available data (a feat in itself), quantum computers can theoretically solve problems for which there are no patterns in the data, and the possibilities to explore are too numerous for even the fastest ""regular computers.""Whoa.How is this possible? According to futurism.com:This increase in speed is made possible through the use of quantum bits (or qubits) instead of the binary bits that current computers employ. Qubits rely on the quantum phenomenon of superposition, which allows them to be 0s or 1s at the same time. This ability to exist in multiple states at once enables qubits to process information more quickly.Everybody got that? Me neither. In fact, even IBM doesn't have all the answers. That is why it is opening up a project called IBM Q, which will enlist anyone interested in the field to contribute code and research, as open source.The company opened up a 5-qubit system in May, but one day hopes to build the world's first quantum computer with 50 qubits, which will help solve problems in medicine, material science, and finance. What's even more exciting is that, according to IBM vice president of science and solutions Dario Gil, ""no one is entirely sure of the full breadth of what a universal quantum computer is capable of.""Apparently, the same goes for analysts and investors when assessing Big Blue."
6 Fascinating Things You Didn't Know About IBM,"Jun 18, 2017 at 1:08PM","Many people are familiar with International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and its wide variety of mainframe computers, business servers, and consulting services. Investors are probably also familiar with its more recent forays into data analytics, cloud computing, and cognitive computing solutions, represented by its AI-based Watson supercomputer.There are, however, a number of innovations that forever changed the technological landscape and paved the way for the larger societal and demographic shifts that followed.IBM HAS A LONG AND FASCINATING HISTORY OF INNOVATION. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.1. An icon is bornIBM began life in June 1911, as CTR -- The Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. Charles Flint, a financier in New York, arranged for the merger of several companies that developed time clocks, computing scales, and tabulating machines. In 1914, Thomas Watson Sr. was brought in to run the company, and the combined entity was renamed International Business Machines in 1924. Coming to IBM as part of the merger, the tabulating machine captured data on holes punched into a 3-by-7-inch card, which revolutionized data and tabulated results from the 1890 Census. It was one of the very first instances of data processing.  This use of electromechanical counters continued to be widely used until the arrival of the first computers in the 1950s. Punched cards continued to feed instructions to computers until the early 1970s.THE TABULATING MACHINE REVOLUTIONIZED THE CAPTURING OF CENSUS DATA. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.2. The magnetic stripeIn the early 1970s, the looming popularity of credit cards and airline travel caused traffic jams at ticket counters and checkout lines. At the time, use of a credit card required several labor- and time-intensive steps (by today's standards) that included making a phone call to authorize the transaction, then placing the card on a metal tray, and imprinting the card numbers on a carbon receipt for the customer's signature. Both banks and airlines were looking for a way expedite customer transactions.A team at IBM developed a machine-readable magnetic strip that's still used on most credit and debit cards today. It could store the necessary information that could then be transmitted via phone lines to a computer for approval. This led to the development of bank ATMs and self-serve airline kiosks to dispense boarding passes. 3. The UPC CodeThe first patent for the UPC code was issued in the early 1950s, but it wasn't until 20 years later, with the advent of lasers to read them, that they found practical application. The grocery industry, seeking ways to speed up checkout lines and automate inventory, looked to computer companies for solutions. IBM applied the UPC, or bar code, to the problem, as well as developing the scanner to read it.In June 1974, a pack of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit chewing gum was the first item to be ""swiped"" using the new system, in Troy, Ohio. The process soon became the grocery industry standard, and the technology formed the basis for the point-of-sale systems that are still in use today. IBM'S UPC CODE AND SCANNERS REVOLUTIONIZED THE GROCERY INDUSTRY. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.4. The floppy diskIn 1967, an IBM team was working on a method to feed instructions into its massive mainframe computers. To install updates or perform data entry, legacy punched cards or magnetic tape transmitted the data. The team developed an inexpensive 8-inch Mylar disk that could be inserted into a slot in the computer, and a magnetic coating on the disk carried the instructions. Problems with dust led to encasing the disks in a durable envelope that wiped the disk as it spun. This early innovation proved useful, if impractical, with the advent of personal computers in the early 1980s, which in turn led to the development of the 5 1/4-inch, and eventually the 3 1/2-inch, floppy disk drive. This was effectively the birth of the software industry, because programs could be written, packaged, and sold to users, who could install them on their own.THE FLOPPY DISK GAVE RISE TO THE BIRTH OF THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.5. LASIK eye surgeryLaser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis eye surgery, better known as LASIK, was developed as the result of a test on leftover Thanksgiving turkey. In the early 1980s, the excimer laser, which produces pulses of ultraviolet light, was commonly used to etch plastic. When tested on the turkey, it disrupted the molecular bonds on a thin layer of the surface flesh without burning the surrounding tissue. After years of research, and with U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in 1995, LASIK has become the most popular form of vision-correction surgery worldwide. By reshaping the cornea, vision is improved, with the use of the laser offering a combination of rapid healing and minimal pain.6. The Deep Blue chess championIn 1997, an IBM computer dubbed Deep Blue was the first computer in history to defeat a world champion in a chess match.  In a six-game match, the supercomputer beat Garry Kasparov, the previously undefeated Russian grandmaster.  Using a technique called brute force, the computer was able to evaluate 200 million chess positions per second to determine its next move. The process was largely one of mathematics and processing speed. The pieces were assigned point values, and Deep Blue was programmed with 100 years of games played by grandmasters. At a seminal moment in the match, Kasparov was unnerved by a move he considered too sophisticated for a computer to make. Years later, one of Deep Blue's designers revealed that the computer was unable to determine its next move, so the pivotal move was one it chose at random. The legacy continuesIn a nod to Foolish long-term buy-and-hold investing, here's another thing about IBM you probably didn't know: One IBM share in 1915, adjusted for all splits and stock dividends, would be equal to 11,880 shares today. IBM continues at the forefront of innovation, applying a combination of data analytics, cognitive computing, and cloud solutions to a variety of business applications. Since its 2011 win on Jeopardy!, IBM's artificial-intelligence supercomputer, Watson, has become the public face of the company's cognitive computing efforts and a key focus of the company's strategic growth initiatives. These have been applied to everything from medicine to cybersecurity. IBM has reinvented itself many times over the past century, and while the market and even famed investor Warren Buffett are beginning to doubt the company's ability to remake itself once again, I wouldn't bet against Big Blue.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Should Investors Be Worried About IBM's Mountain of Debt?,"Nov 22, 2017 at 8:10AM","Unlike other large technology companies that have spent the past few years piling up mountains of cash, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has piled up a mountain of debt. IBM's total debt stood at $45.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, far higher than its cash balance of $11.5 billion. Five years ago, IBM's debt was just $33.7 billion.IBM's share-buyback program is one reason for this rising debt load. From 2012 through 2016, IBM spent a whopping $47.6 billion on share buybacks. The cash flow covered most of this spending, but not all of it.Should investors be worried about IBM's balance sheet? In short, no. Here's why.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Two kinds of debtTo get a better sense of the strength of IBM's balance sheet, the debt needs to be broken down into two parts. IBM operates a financing business, called global financing, which provides financing solutions to its customers. Nearly all mainframe systems are financed, according to CFO Martin Schroeter, with an attach rate of about 90%. The latest mainframe launch will boost not only hardware sales but financing volume as well.Global Financing had a portfolio of receivables worth $26.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, the majority of which are investment grade. IBM borrows money to facilitate this lending. In the third quarter, it issued $3 billion of debt to support the financing business. Global Financing debt now totals $29.4 billion, about two-thirds of IBM's debt load.The remaining one-third of IBM's debt is corporate debt, not tied to the financing business. This debt was $16.2 billion at the end of the third quarter, less than $5 billion more than the company's cash on hand. Corporate debt has risen over the past five years, but it accounts for only about half of the total increase.DATA SOURCE: IBM. CHART BY AUTHOR. The financing debt certainly shouldn't be ignored. There's always the risk that financing customers default at a higher rate than expected, dragging down the bottom line for IBM. But lumping together the financing debt and the corporate debt and claiming that IBM has too much debt doesn't make much sense. The financing debt is offset by financing receivables; the corporate debt is not.Plenty of cash and cash flowAbout 70% of IBM's $16.2 billion of corporate debt is covered by cash. This debt is also mostly covered by a single year of free cash flow. IBM produced $11.6 billion of free cash flow, excluding financing receivables, in 2016, and it expects to produce roughly the same amount this year.Interest expenses are not particularly large, either. IBM spent $630 million on interest payments in 2016 on all its debt. The financing portion of that interest is more than offset by financing revenue. The corporate portion is a fraction of the total.Despite a run-up in corporate debt fueled by share buybacks over the past five years, IBM's balance sheet is still rock solid. IBM has slowed down the pace of share buybacks dramatically in the past couple of years, which has helped to keep the corporate debt in check. The company spent just $3.5 billion on share buybacks last year, down from a peak of $13.9 billion in 2013.IBM's mountain of debt is nothing to worry about. Most of it supports the financing business and drives sales of mainframe systems and other products. The rest is small enough to be more than covered by cash on hand and a single year of free cash flow. With IBM on the cusp of returning to growth, don't let the balance sheet scare you away from investing in this undervalued tech giant."
Will IBM Stock Ever See $200 Again?,"Sep 13, 2017 at 8:05AM","It's been four years since shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) sat above $200. A post-financial crisis rally drove IBM stock to new all-time highs, but a seemingly endless turnaround featuring constantly slumping revenue has since taken the wind out of Big Blue's sails. IBM stock now trades for around $145 per share, about 30% below its peak.Longtime IBM investors are surely wondering if the stock will return to those 2013 highs. A rally in 2016 gave investors some hope, but the stock has given up most of those gains this year, with revenue continuing to grind lower. The story is going to have to change before IBM stock recovers, and that will require a return to growth that has so far eluded the company.IBM DATA BY YCHARTSThe IBM story todayRevenue has declined on a year-over-year basis for 21 straight quarters at IBM. That's a streak that prevents many investors from even considering buying the stock. IBM produced more than $100 billion of revenue as recently as 2012. Last year, revenue came in below $80 billion, the lowest level in decades.Three factors have been driving IBM's sales lower. First, various legacy businesses are in decline as the company invests in newer growth areas that have yet to pick up the slack. Second, IBM has sold off underperforming units, such as its x86 server business, over the past few years, which has taken a bite out of revenue. And third, a surging U.S. dollar in late 2014 and 2015 knocked down sales from the company's vast international business due to currency translation effects.Profits have tumbled right along with revenue. IBM produced $13.59 in adjusted earnings per share last year, down from $14.92 per share in 2015, and a far cry from the $20 per share target that the company was forced to abandon in late 2014. IBM does expect per-share earnings to rise slightly this year, but with revenue still moving in the opposite direction, it's unclear whether this marks a new trend or a blip that will give way to more profit declines in the future.IBM is banking on areas like cloud computing and artificial intelligence to return it to growth. The company's cloud business generated $15.1 billion of revenue over the past twelve months, and the as-a-service cloud revenue run rate is now at $8.8 billion. Watson, IBM's cognitive-computing system, generates a lot of headlines, but the company doesn't disclose any financial information. Regardless, it hasn't been enough to offset declines in the rest of the business.THE IBM WATSON LOGO. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Not so far-fetchedIBM stock is cheap if you assume the company will eventually return to growth. With adjusted earnings expected to be at least $13.80 per share this year, the stock trades for just 10.5 times this number. A $200 share price would put the P/E ratio at just 14.5, still far below the mid-20s PE ratio of the S&P 500.The market is pricing IBM as if it will remain stagnant indefinitely. So far, the company hasn't given the market much reason to change its mind. Parts of IBM are growing; other parts are shrinking. The net result has been a decline that seems to drag on and on.But things may start looking better during the second half of this year, at least temporarily. IBM launched its newest mainframe system in July, which will produce a significant revenue boost during the third quarter. The U.S. dollar has also been slumping this year relative to other currencies, a situation that could create a tailwind for IBM's international businesses.If IBM manages to report a solid second half, the real test will be whether it can sustain that momentum in 2018. Turnarounds take time, especially for large, complex companies. But it's hard to justify five years of slumping revenue.In a scenario where IBM pulls out of its slump and returns to growth next year, a $200 stock price could prove pessimistic. The valuation is so beaten-down, and expectations are so low, that even anemic growth would be enough to send the stock soaring. After years of talking about its transformation, it's time for IBM to deliver."
"As Warren Buffett Throws in the Towel, What's Next for IBM?","Nov 18, 2017 at 3:16PM","In a rare misfire for the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett continues to admit defeat by unloading shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold off approximately 33% of its holdings in the technology company during the quarter ended Sept. 30.This isn't the first time Buffett has trimmed his IBM position. Earlier this year, the company sold off 33% of its stake after admitting his initial thesis was too optimistic due to ""big, strong competitors."" After owning more than 81 million shares as of year-end 2016, Berkshire Hathaway now reports a stake of 37 million shares as of its last holdings filing.In the short term, this is another black eye for a company that continues to struggle. In the past five years, shares of IBM are down approximately 20% while the greater S&P 500 is up 90%. Still, with a forward price-to-earnings multiple of only 10.5 times and a yield near 4%, should you bet against Buffett and on this turnaround company?IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.IBM had a (relatively) decent quarterBuffett's decision to unload more shares was interesting considering IBM had a rare decent quarter. The company continues to report a shrinking top line, with the third quarter representing the 22nd consecutive of declining revenue. However, shares advanced due to better-than-expected results.Analysts estimated IBM would report $18.6 billion in revenue and $3.28 EPS (excluding certain items). IBM beat on both by reporting $19.15 billion and $3.30, respectively. IBM also upwardly revised full-year EPS guidance by a nickel to $13.80.IBM's ruinous Roadmap 2015It's important to note the $13.80 in EPS guidance to understand Buffett's frustration. In 2011, then-CEO Sam Palmisano announced Roadmap 2015, in which the company promised to hit $20 EPS by that year. In 2014, current CEO Ginni Rometty backed away from that audacious goal.To support the EPS estimate, IBM engaged in an aggressive, debt-fueled share buyback scheme, spending nearly $70 billion from fiscal years 2010 to 2014. As a comparison, IBM is currently a $135 billion company. Meanwhile, the company failed to quickly adjust to a large change in consumer behavior as many businesses shifted to off-site cloud storage instead of traditional mainframe hardware and supporting services.Rometty has shifted the focus away from EPS estimates to ""strategic imperatives,"" which includes next-gen technologies like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and mobile technologies. Last quarter these initiatives represented 46% of total revenue and grew 11% on a year-over-year basis.Are you going to bet against Buffett?Getting in IBM while Buffett is unloading his position is essentially betting against the Oracle of Omaha. While IBM had a better quarter, including increasing its cloud-based revenue by 20%, IBM still must compete with big competitors like Amazon.com, Microsoft, and Alphabet.With IBM, you should ask: Is the company now a value play or a value trap? While the company appears cheap on relative valuations, sluggish top and bottom line growth supports Buffett's decision to sell the company. However, if you're a value-oriented, income-focused investor looking for a turnaround story, keep IBM on your watchlist and follow the company's strategic imperatives very closely for further signs of strength."
10 Reasons to Buy IBM Stock,"Dec 20, 2017 at 8:39AM","Under CEO Ginni Rometty, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has been pursuing its ""strategic imperatives"" for five years now. 2018 just might be the year when Big Blue's dedication pays off in the form of renewed sales growth and stronger earnings.Read on and I'll show you 10 great reasons to buy IBM stock today.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.1. Change with the times or die tryingYour business won't stick around for 130 years if management isn't willing to adapt to changing market conditions. Big Blue is no longer the king of punch cards or mechanical adding machines, because there's not much of a business opportunity left in those markets. Likewise, IBM is currently getting out of the one-stop-shop model for all your IT needs that served it so well in the 1990s and 2000s -- there's a new era rolling in, and Rometty is pulling every string to stay relevant for the long run.2. Strategic imperatives are workingSo IBM has sold off most of its computing hardware operations to double down on a basket of high-growth businesses known as the company's strategic imperatives. That combination of cloud computing, data security, artificial intelligence, and mobile technologies combined for $33 billion of the company's $80 billion in top-line revenues in 2016 and should account for over half of IBM's sales in 2018 and beyond.3. Big Blue is already a leader in blockchain technologiesNo, IBM is not a bitcoin miner. But the underlying technology behind the cryptocurrency boom is very much in Big Blue's wheelhouse. IBM has patented and marketed dozens of blockchain technologies, and there's plenty of additional research going on. For example, IBM's blockchain solutions are helping grocery chains and food producers track and manage meat and vegetable products from the farm to the store's checkout counter. That's just the beginning, and blockchain technologies are very much a part of IBM's strategic imperatives.4. And don't forget about quantum computingQuantum computers will be able to handle many equations that are downright unsolvable by traditional semiconductors. IBM is far from the only technology giant exploring this revolutionary new technology, but it's certainly an early leader in the quantum computing space. IBM's systems have scaled up from 5 qubits of computing power to 16 qubits over the last year alone, aiming for 50 cubits in 2018. The computing power that's unlocked by more cubits is an exponential graph, so the real gains or tripling the cubits are bigger than just running three systems in parallel.5. The hard part of this strategy shift is all doneThe new business strategy has been hard on IBM's top line and investor returns. IBM's annual sales have fallen 24% lower over the past five years as several high-volume businesses found new homes. Dividend-adjusted share prices fell 9% over the same period, missing out on a general market boom as the S&P 500 market index more than doubled over the same period, assuming reinvested dividends. But that should be the worst of it; IBM's management says that things are looking up in 2018, as the flag has been planted for improving business metrics from a trough in 2017.For the last few items, I'll be talking about IBM in the light of its chief business rivals. Here's where Big Blue stands on a number of important metrics compared to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) at the end of 2017:CompanyMarket CapReturn on Equity (TTM)Dividend YieldP/E Ratio (TTM)Market Gains In 2017IBM$143 billion60%3.9%12.8(7.6%)Microsoft$665 billion29%1.9%29.239%Oracle$210 billion18%1.6%20.822%Alphabet$741 billion14%--36.234%Amazon$571 billion9%--30159%DATA SOURCE: FINVIZ.COM, AS OF 12/19/2017.

None of IBM's peers comes close to matching this hand-over-fist return of cash directly to shareholders.7. Sector-leading returns on equityIBM is peerless when it comes to returns on shareholders' equity or returns on invested capital. That double play speaks highly of Rometty's efficient management of operations.8. The IT market as a whole is doing great...All of IBM's largest competitors saw their share prices skyrocket this year, as their products and services were in uniformly high demand.9.... but investors have forgotten about IBMIt's easy to find IBM skeptics these days, holding share prices back and driving the price-to-earnings ratio straight down into the bargain bin. I suppose that's fine if you still think that Big Blue's comeback remains years away, but we've already covered plenty of bullish signs for the coming year.10. Headroom for large gains in 2018On the upside, that means you could score some impressive returns on your own investment by betting on IBM today. We're talking about a high-quality company with industry-leading efficiencies and a skyrocketing portfolio of strategic imperatives operations. If IBM can prove its mettle in 2018, the company should deserve a premium price compared to its rivals -- not the big discount you see right now."
IBM Watson: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know,"Aug 30, 2017 at 6:09AM","In 2011, IBM's (NYSE:IBM) Watson artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputer beat 74-time-straight Jeopardy! champion Ken Jennings in a man-vs.-machine showdown on primetime television. ""Winning"" $77,147 to Jennings' $24,000, Watson arguably proved itself three times as intelligent as his human opponent. In so doing, IBM ushered in the new age of AI, in which humans no longer work for food, and computers do all of our thinking for us.Oh, wait. That actually didn't happen.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.But in the six years since Watson beat Jennings on Jeopardy!, IBM's AI wunderkind has been in the news plenty. Among other projects, Watson has been tasked with tackling two of humanity's biggest challenges: helping Pfizer figure out a cure for cancer and navigating the U.S. tax code for H&R Block. Yet what exactly Watson is remains something of a mystery to many. In an attempt to get a better handle on Watson, I posed some questions via email to IBM Vice President Ed Harbour, head of the IBM Watson project.Here's what he had to say. (The interview has been edited to aid clarity and brevity).Rich Smith: What is Watson, exactly? Is it code? Is it servers? What is the clearest way a layman can envision Watson? Ed Harbour: Watson is the AI platform for business. It is not one thing, but rather a collection of services and capabilities that include machine learning, reasoning, and decision technologies, as well as language, speech, and vision technologies. These capabilities are designed to learn at scale, reason with purpose, and interact with humans naturally to solve a wide range of practical problems, boost productivity, and foster new discoveries across many industries.Watson can turn business data -- even data that is unstructured -- into actionable insights that enhance decision-making. Watson can take many forms, from virtual assistant to care manager, research module to customer service agent. Watson leverages the IBM Cloud, offering access to an unprecedented set of enterprise-grade cloud services that can further enhance its function to meet various business needs.Smith: How does Watson differ from more familiar forms of AI such as Apple's Siri and Amazon.com's Alexa? Harbour: Watson and Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa do totally different things. Their foundation is quite basic and just speech to text to search. Watson delivers a conversation; it delivers answers, alternatives, and evidence-based recommendations with confidence. It learns from interactions and expert training, grows and develops over time. In addition to answers, it offers alternatives and background on why it made the decisions it recommends to users. Watson retains conversations and can understand context and domain. Watson is an AI platform for the enterprise.Other forms of AI, like Siri or Alexa, rely solely on Q&A and speech to text. They use pre-compiled, human-curated databases or FAQs to look up keywords, as do search engines like Google. Consumer data is not where most of the value is. Eighty percent of the world's data is not on the Web, but rather embedded in businesses and industries, such as client data, financial data, and medical data. Our approach is to build cognitive solutions to help specific industries and businesses tap this data. A key aspect is Watson protects clients' data and any business insights. This is not shared. Watson is also deployed on the IBM Cloud and can be scaled to meet any enterprise needs.For example, in the case of IBM client H&R Block, Watson was enlisted to understand the ""language"" of tax to provide the most personalized tax-preparation experience. Watson, with the Tax Professional, helped ensure that consumers were getting the best possible tax outcome and also made the entire tax return process a more collaborative, transparent experience. The main differentiator with Watson is the actionable capability and insights it brings to enterprise clients.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Smith: What would you say is the public's biggest misperception about Watson? What is one thing that folks might think that Watson can do that it actually cannot? Harbour: The biggest misperception about Watson is that it's meant to replace humans. Watson works with humans to enhance the abilities of professionals at every level, from highly specialized surgeons to oil drillers, and automates many basic tasks. However, no matter how advanced the technology, some jobs -- specifically, those that rely heavily on empathy, ethical judgment, and social interaction -- will always be performed better by humans.Cognitive computing introduces a new level of collaboration between man and machine. It will augment and expand human intelligence, not replace it. Smith: Can you name one concrete example of something you would like Watson to be able to do that it cannot quite manage yet? Harbour: The future of technology is rooted in artificial intelligence. In the next three to five years, you'll see advancements that crack the uniquely human nature of communication. For example, Watson has started to be able to detect facial expressions, to combine words, voice, and visual interfaces and form a complete understanding of a conversation. IBM is also further developing Watson's ability to understand different vocalizations of words and how that reinforces a person's emotional meaning.The true value of Watson and cognitive systems is how it can augment and amplify human abilities. To help us think and perform our jobs better, faster, not to do it for us.Smith: How human is Watson right now? Would it be possible for someone to interview Watson about Watson? Harbour: Watson is trained on specific data sets to unearth insights into different industries, tasks, and specialties. Once trained, with its speech, language, and intelligence capabilities, Watson can learn and understand the intention behind a specific command and provide a refined answer for the specific industry or profession it was trained to help.While it's technically possible to train Watson to answer questions about its own technology, unlike humans, Watson does not have a personality, so it may not make for the most engaging interview subject.Smith: How does Watson get smarter? By adding data? By refining algorithms? Both? Harbour: Watson technologies are trained by humans to understand information specific to different industries, specialties, and languages -- in other words, Watson learns in an expert way, not just a general way. This involves training the system to recognize patterns by feeding it large amounts of labeled data and then working with human experts to refine the answers. Through successive rounds of input and feedback from subject-matter experts, Watson's understanding and responses improve. Looking at the implementation of specific Watson technologies -- Natural Language Understanding and Tone Analyzer are designed to allow developers to quickly bake these functionalities into their apps and see value, without a consultant. Watson Conversation Service enables powerful engagement, and Watson Discovery Service allows for unearthing powerful insights often distributed over vast amounts of documents. Even more robust services like Watson Virtual Agent -- a customer-service chatbot -- come pre-trained with over 105 intents and 35,000 utterances and ready for domains such as general customer service, telco, and retail banking. We also built Watson Knowledge Studio, which allows clients to train Watson on the language of their industry, profession, and domain -- easily. We are continually improving and refining the various underlying algorithms that power the Watson platform.Smith: How expensive is it for a client to use Watson? How is it billed?Harbour: Our approach to delivering Watson is flexible and tailored to the clients with both industry solutions and APIs available on the IBM Cloud.We have several business models for Watson. The overarching theme is value-based. It's really focused on driving scale.Data Access/Pay Per Insights: The first business model is Pay Per Insight, so every time you touch that data, or you get an insight ... we are paid for the capabilities or insight.Subscription: Some companies want to have this capability. A pharma company wants to have this capability for their entire research team, and so they will pay us a subscription for each researcher.Share-Value With Partners: So, where our intellectual property, our data comes together with our key partners' data or insight or domain expertise and we create new value to take cost out of the system or improve capability, we share in that value that we create going forward.Licensing: A licensing and partnering model around the world.Smith: Can you quantify how important Watson is to IBM's business today, in terms of the revenue it produces?Harbour: Watson is part of our analytics business in our cognitive-solutions segment. In 2Q17, we reported that revenues in this segment grew to $4.6 billion. Over the last 12 months, our strategic imperatives, which includes analytics, has delivered $34.1 billion in revenue, 43% of IBM's total revenue.Another good indicator of where we are in the cognitive journey is to look at scaling, where we started and where we are now. Watson was just a natural-language machine six years ago. If you want to think of it in terms of a human, it could only ""hear"" or ""read"" and only basic information at that.Today, Watson has grown from that one natural-language QA API into a multitude of services. It has gone from simply speaking English to understanding nine languages. We've added more capabilities and have built extensive data sets industry by industry to train Watson to solve complex industry problems.It not only can reason over simple trivia; it can reason through complex industry-specific data, like cybersecurity data or cancer data. And it not only ""reads."" It can ""see."" Watson can look at medical images and flag ones for radiologists that are unusual -- and it can understand emotion and tone, too. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.These capabilities are being deployed in enterprises faster. For example, you mentioned cancer research. Watson took a couple of years to learn about oncology after its Jeopardy! win in 2011. But look where we are today. We've entered clinical use in 12 countries and are expanding to more countries later this year. Watson so far has been trained on six types of cancer, with plans to add several more this year.On taxes, we started with H&R Block last summer. It took us a few months to build a solution for them, and this year somewhere in the ballpark of 11 million people did their taxes at an H&R Block office, powered by Watson.Another metric of success is embedding Watson across the IBM portfolio. That's our mission. We've been describing Watson as a sliver thread, weaving through multiple areas and segments. We're helping colleagues across our portfolio embed Watson into existing offerings. We've been successful in security, commerce, technology services, and systems, to name a few.Smith: In addition to cancer and taxes, you are also using Watson to provide individual health and fitness insights to more than 190 million users of Under Armour's connected-fitness platform, while simultaneously providing traffic information to Chevy, Buick, and GMC drivers through General Motors' OnStar service. Is there a limit on the amount of juggling Watson can do, working for so many customers simultaneously? Harbour: Each client gets their own ""instance"" of Watson to train with their data, to meet their needs. We can scale to any number by deploying on the IBM Cloud. The applications for this technology are limitless, and we expect to help more than 1 billion people this year.We are continuously working to advance this adoption -- drawing more developers to use cognitive engines like Watson to build their own apps, working with more businesses and industries so they can incorporate cognitive solutions into their workflows.Smith: Put Watson in context versus other AIs. How does it stack up against the competition today?Harbour: IBM has a significant lead in the industry in applying AI technology, having been researching, developing, and investing in AI technology for more than 50 years. We also have the largest industrial research organization in the world and in 2016 led the industry in AI-related patents held.Unlike other technologies in the market today that are in the experimental or elementary stage, Watson is a mature platform making a real impact on the industries it touches. Watson solutions are now being built, used, and deployed in more than 45 countries and across 20 different industries, solving big, complex societal problems, like cancer and cybersecurity. IBM has also made meaningful progress in other industries, ranging from education to commerce. Smith: And now look 10 years into the future. What are the chances that in 2027, the average consumer will be able to use Watson in daily life?Harbour: There's a chance that you use Watson already. For example, in addition to people taking their W-2s to H&R Block for cognitive interviews, people may be using Watson when ordering office supplies from Staples, interacting with a gift concierge via 1-800-Flowers' Gwyn system, checking auto recall and warranty information via Honda's ""Ask Dave"" interface, or interacting with Harman/IBM-powered smart rooms.In the healthcare space, Watson is about more than just cancer treatment. It's available to more than 200 million patients globally, collaborating with doctors, helping improve treatment recommendations and helping deliver more efficient care.AI is playing a bigger and bigger role in consumers' day-to-day lives. By the end of this year, IBM Watson will be available to more than a billion consumers of all kinds, helping them discover the right insurance options, make travel reservations, troubleshoot their IT, answer weather-related questions, get faster service from their bank, and more.

IBM Will Return to Growth This Year,"Oct 18, 2017 at 12:25PM","The new z14 mainframe from International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) very nearly ended the company's long streak of revenue declines. Sales slumped by just 0.4% year over year during the third quarter. That marks 22 consecutive quarters of declining revenue, but also IBM's biggest revenue beat in years.The big news, though, is that IBM expects to produce revenue growth during the fourth quarter. CFO Martin Schroeter said during the conference call that he expects the mainframe cycle to drive a stronger fourth quarter this year. Based on the numbers he laid out, revenue could grow by as much as 1.3% year over year. That may not sound impressive, but it will be the first time in a long time that IBM has managed to move the top line in the right direction.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Growth where it countsThere were no real surprises in IBM's third-quarter results, other than total revenue coming in well ahead of analyst estimates. The company produced $19.15 billion of sales, about $550 million more than analysts were expecting. A big boost in mainframe sales and strong cloud growth came close to offsetting continued declines in IBM's legacy businesses.The z14 mainframe began shipping in mid-September, so the initial sales boost that IBM sees when it launches a new mainframe system will leak into the fourth quarter. Mainframe sales soared 62% year over year during the third quarter, helping to drive a 14% rise in systems hardware revenue.The cloud computing business also grew at an impressive pace. Trailing-12-month cloud revenue jumped 25% year over year to $15.8 billion, accounting for 20% of IBM's total revenue. Cloud delivered as a service reached a $9.4 billion annual revenue run rate, also up 25% year over year. IBM's cloud business includes not only public infrastructure as a service but also hybrid cloud, private cloud, and high-value services like those built on Watson.IBM's strategic-imperative businesses, comprised of analytics, cloud, mobile, security, and social, produced 11% year-over-year growth during the third quarter. Over the past 12 months, the strategic imperatives generated $34.9 billion of revenue, roughly 45% of IBM's total revenue. The rest of IBM's business, what it calls its ""core"" business, slumped by 8% during the quarter. The inflection point where declines in the core business are finally overcome by growth in the strategic imperatives is tantalizingly close.IBM produced $3.30 in adjusted earnings per share during the third quarter, up $0.01 from the prior-year period and $0.02 higher than the average analyst estimate. The company reiterated its full-year earnings guidance, calling for adjusted EPS of at least $13.80, along with roughly flat free cash flow.A strong fourth quarter expectedIBM generally doesn't provide much in the way of revenue guidance, but the company made an exception during the conference call. Schroeter explained that the mainframe cycle would drive a stronger fourth quarter than last year, estimating that the change in revenue from the third quarter would be between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion. That range implies year-over-year revenue growth, no doubt music to IBM shareholders' ears.If IBM delivers on that target, its streak of revenue declines will end at 22 quarters. Ironically, despite its transformation being based on hot technologies like cloud computing and artificial intelligence, it will be the decades-old mainframe business that ultimately pushes IBM's top line back into positive territory.Whether or not this expected bump in revenue is sustainable is unclear. The mainframe cycle typically produces an initial sales spike that peters out over the span of a few quarters. As IBM enters 2018, the strategic imperatives will need to become the driver of revenue growth as mainframe sales moderate.IBM needed to change the narrative with its third-quarter report, and it appears to have done just that. A return to revenue growth is on the horizon, and if the initial boost to the stock following the third-quarter report is any indication, investors are pretty happy about that. A return to growth doesn't mark the end of IBM's transformation, but it's an important milestone that provides some evidence that the company's strategy is working.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

IBM's New Mainframe Is a Security Powerhouse,"Jul 17, 2017 at 6:00AM","While the term ""mainframe"" may conjure images of room-sized computers cranking out calculations decades ago, International Business Machines' (NYSE:IBM) ever-evolving mainframe systems remain relevant more than 50 years after their initial introduction. A staggering 87% of all credit card transactions are touched by an IBM mainframe, along with 29 billion ATM transactions and 4 billion passenger flight bookings annually. A major mainframe refresh comes every few years from IBM, prompting existing customers to upgrade and producing a nice revenue boost for Big Blue.The last major mainframe refresh came in January 2015 with the launch of the System z13. The z13 is capable of processing 2.5 billion transactions per day, with real-time encryption and embedded analytics. The big selling point of the system was that it could deal with the deluge of financial transactions initiated on mobile devices. A single z13 system can process the equivalent of 100 Cyber Mondays every day. IBM estimated at the time that 40 trillion mobile transactions would take place each day by 2025.The next mainframe is hereIBM unveiled the 14th iteration of its mainframe system this morning, the IBM Z. It's quite an upgrade, capable of processing 12 billion encrypted transactions each day, a nearly fivefold increase compared to its predecessor. It sports 32 terabytes of memory, triple what the z13 offers, and IBM claims that its input/output performance is three times that of the z13.THE IBM Z. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.The major focus of the IBM Z is security. The system is capable of encrypting all data associated with an application, cloud service, or database, as opposed to previous systems where data is encrypted selectively. A sevenfold increase in cryptographic performance, enabled by a fourfold rise in silicon dedicated to cryptographic algorithms, allows for this expanded encryption to have no negative effect on system performance.This security push comes at a time when cyberattacks are increasingly making the news. A ransomware virus emerged in June in Ukraine and quickly spread globally, locking computers and demanding payment in bitcoins. Major companies like shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk and FedEx were disrupted. This followed a similar incident in May, when the WannaCry ransomware attack spread to hundreds of thousands of computers.According to IBM, more than 4 billion records were leaked last year due to cyberattacks, a more than sixfold jump compared to 2015. An IBM study found that heavy use of encryption can reduce the cost of dealing with such attacks by $16 per record, representing potential savings of tens of billions of dollars.Despite the benefits of encryption, IBM claims that just 2% of all corporate data is currently encrypted. A study done by RedLock Cloud Security Intelligence earlier this year found that a staggering of 82% of cloud databases aren't encrypted at all. IBM claims that this aversion to encryption is due to performance degradation that occurs on x86 systems when encryption is implemented. The IBM Z, with its dedicated encryption hardware, doesn't have that problem.What it means for investorsIBM enjoys a surge in sales each time a new mainframe is launched, driven by existing customers, such as 92 of the world's top 100 banks, upgrading to the new system. This time around shouldn't be any different, particularly with cybersecurity being such a major issue. The launch of the System z13 during the first quarter of 2015 produced a year-over-year revenue increase of 130% for the mainframe business, and a roughly $400 million increase in hardware revenue.This initial surge eventually fades, with a few quarters of year-over-year mainframe sales growth followed by declines. This pattern has consistently repeated over the past decade:CHART BY AUTHOR. DATA SOURCE: IBM.IBM has reported 20 consecutive quarters of revenue declines, and this number will likely rise to 21 on Tuesday when the company reports its second-quarter results. The launch of the IBM Z may be enough to put an end to that streak during the third quarter, although sustainable revenue growth will require IBM's growth business, like cloud computing and analytics, to finally offset declines in legacy businesses. IBM does expect to grow per-share adjusted earnings this year, and the launch of the IBM Z will help the cause, due to both additional revenue and a reduction in system development spending.In spite of monumental shifts in computing over the years, with the latest being cloud computing, IBM's mainframe has remained relevant thanks to constant iteration and improvement. The IBM Z, a security powerhouse, carries on the torch for IBM.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons Why IBM Investors Shouldn't Panic about Buffett's Sales,"Nov 28, 2017 at 7:07PM","Warren Buffett once said his favorite holding period for stocks is, ""forever."" Therefore, it was likely jarring to shareholders that Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) began selling off its stake in IBM (NYSE:IBM) earlier this year. We also just learned via Berkshire Hathaway's recent 13F filing that Buffett sold another 31% of the IBM stake this summer, trimming the position from 54 million to 37 million shares.Since Berkshire has a huge amount of excess cash lying around, the fact that Buffett chose to sell could be a sign of deep trouble with IBM. However, while the sale is not exactly great news, I don't think current IBM shareholders should panic, either. Here's why.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Outdated infoFirst, one must remember that Berkshire's 13F shows us Buffett's trades over the summer, well before IBM came out with its positive third quarter earnings report. While I'm not sure one earnings report would have changed Buffett's mind, the report certainly gave me greater confidence in IBM's turnaround efforts and execution.In the third quarter, IBM's Strategic Imperatives grew quite handily at 10%, with several segments actually accelerating. That contrasts with the second quarter earnings report (which occurred during the quarter when Buffett was selling) when Strategic Imperatives grew 7% and seemed to be slowing down. Tax loss sellingAnother thing that could have contributed to Buffett's sale was the prospect of a comprehensive tax reform in 2018. The Republicans are trying to lower the capital gains tax rate as part of their tax plan, and Buffett said in a recent CNBC interview that the prospect of tax reform could be affecting what he is buying and selling:I would feel kind of silly if I realized a billion dollars worth of gains to pay 350 million of tax on it if just waited a few months and would have paid 250.   Thus, if Buffett does not expect IBM's stock to meaningfully appreciate in the near-term, selling shares at a loss would allow Berkshire to realize a greater tax loss on IBM now. Essentially saving the company money in taxes.If the Republican capital gains tax cut goes through, those tax losses would not be as beneficial in the future. Thus, Berkshire can lower its taxes in 2017 via these IBM losses.While Buffett probably wouldn't have sold if he thought IBM was going up a lot in the near-term, his quote from the CNBC interview leads me to believe tax reform was at least a factor in his thinking.The world's greatest investor, not GodFinally, it's possible that Buffett is just plain wrong about IBM. After all, Buffett admitted that he made a mistake with his IBM buy, and has also said that by selling, he could very well be making a mistake twice.In fact, remember that Buffett exited his stake in Wal-mart around one year ago, and Walmart has been on a tear this year, appreciating 40% over the past twelve months.  That's another company fighting back against Amazon, which seems to be holding its own, at least in the near-term. In fact, Buffett has often said his biggest mistakes were errors of omission, as in, missing out on big winners because he is so risk-averse. In that light, I think his IBM exit has more to do with uncertainty regarding IBM's competitive advantage, not outright bearishness.What should you do?As I have written before, IBM is so interesting because it is a very cheap stock on a price-to-earnings basis, and is a mix of declining legacy businesses along with growth shoots in next-generation technologies and patents. In that light, it could fit into either a value or growth investor's portfolio. That being said, there is enough uncertainty around the company that I think it should remain a small or medium-sized position in a well-diversified portfolio. As we all know, Buffett doesn't like diversification, but rather concentration in high-conviction picks. In that light, and given the prospects of tax reform, it's not surprising to see the Oracle of Omaha lighten up on IBM.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Has IBM Finally Turned Itself Around?,"Nov 8, 2017 at 5:36PM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) investors got a rare treat when IBM reported earnings -- optimism! Big Blue reported third-quarter results that exceeded analyst expectations by a good margin. The top line was especially important, as skeptics usually point to Big Blue's 22 straight quarters of declining revenue as evidence of a rapidly eroding business.But the company's revenue of $19.15 billion beat analyst expectations by a significant $550 million. To be sure, this figure was still down year-over-year, but only by 0.4%, suggesting a bottoming of IBM's revenue trajectory, and the possibility of the long-awaited-for return to growth, the lack of which has vexed impatient investors over the past few years. So what's behind the positive numbers, and are they for real?IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Losses moderatingAs you can see from the chart below, IBM's revenue and profit metrics appear to be on a steady decline; however, you can also see that the trend is moderating. This quarter's year-over-year revenue decline of (0.4%) marked a sequential improvement from last quarter's (3%) revenue decline.IBM Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsWithin that steady decline is a lot of noise, including a rapid decline of IBM's legacy businesses such as on-premise hardware and software, as well as some commoditized services; however, this is being offset by rapid growth in ""Strategic Imperatives"" of cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security.Strategic imperatives shinedThese strategic imperatives showed impressive growth, as you can see here:Strategic Imperative 2Q 17 YOY Growth3Q 17 YOY Growth3Q TotalCloud15%20%$4.1 billionAnalytics4%5%$5.0 billionAs-a-service run rate31.3%25.3%$9.4 billionMobile27%7%$1.7 billionSecurity4%51%$0.7 billionDATA SOURCE: IBM COMPANY FILINGS. TABLE BY THE AUTHOR.All told, strategic imperatives as a whole grew 10% year-over-year, a marked improvement over the second quarter's 5% growth (7% adjusted for currency). They now make up 45% of IBM's revenue, up from 43% in Q2.   Each segment displayed strong growth, with an acceleration in the largest segments of analytics and cloud.  As the company is moving more toward a software-as-a-service model, the company should experience increasing margins as these businesses grow.Old dog, new tricksAnother particular standout was IBM's new mainframe computer, the z14 system, which was only released for the last two weeks of September. Mainframes are the refrigerator-sized supercomputers that the world's biggest businesses use for processing their most sensitive transactions and data. While many businesses are switching these functions to the public cloud, companies with extremely sensitive data such as banks and airlines still do much of this in private data centers.The new mainframe from IBM has full encryption capabilities without human intervention and without a degradation in performance, and the company saw strong demand for the new product. Cybersecurity is front and center these days, as many high-profile attacks have occurred this year, with 1.9 billion data records being compromised so far in 2017 -- a stunning 164% over 2016. Even more distressing is that 2016 saw a 556% increase in compromised records over 2015!Only 4% of enterprise data had been encrypted up until now, often due to the cost and performance requirements to encrypt data end-to-end. The new mainframe appears to have unique capabilities, which means IBM should at least retain its competitive position in the most highly sensitive business operations.And while the mainframe is a cyclical business, much of the software and security subscription features that go with it are not, as CFO Martin Schroeter explained on the conference call. That is why the new mainframe could give a more lasting boost -- or at least a stabilization -- to IBM's revenues.Growth seedsThis mainframe is also the computing power behind some of IBM's biggest bets, including blockchain and Watson, each of which also showed promise in the quarter. Watson Health grew double-digit, while Watson Financial Services also noted posted strong growth -- likely the effect of 2016's acquisition of Promontory Financial Group. On the blockchain front, IBM also touted a new food safety blockchain initiative with leading food retailers, as well as a new partnership with global banks to pursue regulated cross-border blockchain transactions.Positive signsIBM posted a great quarter that benefited from investments made in the tough past few years. If the current business is stabilizing, investors get to own a reasonably priced, cash-generative business and a 3.75% dividend, with a free option on many of the company's moonshots. To me, that seems like a great risk-reward, even after the post-earnings surge.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Dividend Stocks That Pay You More Than IBM Does,"Dec 20, 2017 at 6:00PM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) was once the most valuable company in the world -- back in the 1980s, when the tech titan dominated the market for mainframe and personal computers. Today, it's been eclipsed by younger tech giants like Apple and Alphabet, but IBM is still a formidable player in information technology. While the stock has struggled in recent years as IBM's transition to a software and services company has taken longer than expected, the company has gained a reputation with investors as a solid dividend payer. It has raised its quarterly payout 17 years in a row, and now offers a strong yield of 3.9%.Still, you can find better yields elsewhere if you know where to look. Below, three of our contributors explain why Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), and Cedar Fair (NYSE:FUN) are better dividend stocks than IBM.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Open up the dividend flood...gateRich Smith (Seagate Technology): I make no apologies for being a fan of IBM's Watson computer technology, and I have to say that as a stock, IBM is also pretty hard to beat. Big Blue remains one of the leading computer technology companies of our time, yet sells for only 12.7 times trailing earnings, and pays a generous dividend yield of 3.9%. It's not easy to find stocks of similar quality, with significantly better numbers -- but I have found one: Seagate Technology.Priced at 15.8 times trailing earnings, Seagate at first glance looks pricier than IBM, but only until you take a look at their relative growth rates. Analysts polled by Yahoo! Finance generally agree that IBM's best growth days are behind it, and it will struggle to grow earnings much faster than 2% over the next five years. In contrast, consensus forecasts call for Seagate to grow earnings at better than 18%, which is fast enough to give the hard-drive specialist a PEG ratio of less than 0.9, versus IBM's PEG ratio of roughly 5.5. (Note: When it comes to PEG ratios, smaller is cheaper -- and better).Granted, last quarter Seagate only grew its earnings 8% year over year, so it may take some time for that 18% growth to materialize. Meanwhile, though, Seagate's dividend yield of 6% is 50% more generous than IBM's. At that rate, I think investors can afford to wait.A high-yield pharma playGeorge Budwell (AstraZeneca): With a forward yield of around 4.4%, the British pharma AstraZeneca sports a richer yield than even International Business Machines Corporation. However, the sustainability of the pharma giant's generous dividend program has lately come under serious scrutiny, for a variety of reasons.The biggest issue is that CEO Pascal Soriot's projection of double-digit top-line growth doesn't appear to be realistic, due to a handful of key setbacks in immuno-oncology. Last July, for instance, Astra's flagship immuno-oncology drug, Imfinzi, failed to meet its primary endpoint as part of a combo therapy in advanced small-cell lung cancer, potentially wiping billions in sales off the table.On the flip side of the coin, Astra has still been able to build a respectable stable of new oncology products -- even though its putative star product in this field has yet to live up to expectations. In the recent past, for example, Astra has gained regulatory approvals for Calquence (a blood-cancer medicine), Tagrisso (an inhibitor for cancers with mutated epidermal growth factor receptors), and Lynparza (for advanced ovarian cancer). Imfinzi can also potentially redeem itself in lung cancer next year, if it can extend the survivorship curve in its ongoing trial. So there's no reason to panic just yet.Down the road, AstraZeneca's eye-popping dividend may have to be pared back, but the final word on its top-notch shareholder rewards program also has yet to be written. The next twelve months will be crucial in determining the fate of Astra's progressive dividend policy. But the company does seem intent on doing everything it can to stave off a reduction, as a service to its loyal shareholders.The right kind of roller coasterJeremy Bowman (Cedar Fair): High-yielding tech stocks aren't easy to find, so investors may want to look further afield than IBM and its peers. One under-the-radar dividend payer I like is Cedar Fair, owner and operator of theme parks including its namesake Cedar Point in Ohio, and more than a dozen others, such as Kings Dominion in Virginia, Great America in California, and Dorney Park in Pennsylvania.The stock, which offers a dividend yield of 5.1% today, has delivered solid returns for investors. Shares have more than doubled over the last five years; the dividend payout has moved steadily higher as well, doubling in that time, though increases have slowed more recently.Cedar Fair's business remains solid; the company posted record revenue of $653 million in the key third quarter, as the summer months are by far the company's busiest time of the year. Earnings per share increased 9% in the period to $3.38, bettering estimates of $3.21.The company also maintained its long-term outlook: to grow adjusted EBITDA at 4% a year, and increase dividends at the same clip. Cedar Fair has a payout ratio of around 100% based on its cash flow, which could present problems if earnings start to fall. But as long as the economy remains strong, Cedar Fair should be able to put up steady growth. Meanwhile, the 5.1% yield should keep investors happy, even if the stock's share appreciation moderates."
Why IBM Shareholders Have Something to Worry About,"Jul 24, 2017 at 3:06PM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) shares recently dropped to a 52-week low after the company posted a mixed second quarter earnings report. Its revenue fell 5% annually to $19.29 billion, which missed estimates by $160 million. Its non-GAAP operating earnings rose less than 1% to $2.97 per share, but still beat expectations by $0.23.The reason for Big Blue's revenue decline was a familiar one -- its higher-growth strategic imperatives (cloud, mobile, analytics, social, and security) couldn't grow fast enough to offset the ongoing declines at its older enterprise software and hardware businesses. But looking ahead, it's hard to see IBM's prospects improving anytime soon for four simple reasons.SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.1. 21 quarters and counting...IBM's quarterly revenue has fallen year-over-year for 21 straight quarters. Analysts expect its revenue to fall 2.6% this year and dip 0.3% next year. At this point, all investors want IBM to do is to post a single quarter of sales growth -- but that seems unlikely considering how poorly its core businesses fared last quarter:Business segmentQ2 RevenueYOY growthCognitive Solutions$4.6 billion(2.5%)Global business services$4.1 billion(3.7%)Technology Services & Cloud Platforms$8.4 billion(5.1%)Systems$1.7 billion(10.4%)Global Financing$415 million(2.2%)SOURCE: IBM Q2 EARNINGS.IBM's strategic imperatives are scattered across those businesses, but their growth certainly didn't move the needle in any department. Foreign currency impacts exacerbated that pain, but all five units still posted negative growth on a constant currency basis.2. Slowing growth in its strategic imperativesThe bull thesis for IBM depends on its strategic imperatives growing fast enough to offset the declines at its legacy businesses. However, IBM's SI revenues rose just 11% annually during the quarter and accounted for 43% of its trailing 12-month revenue. That growth is disappointing compared to its previous quarters:  Q2 2016Q3 2016Q4 2016Q1 2017Q2 2017SI annual growth12%16%13%12%11%% of IBM's trailing 12-month revenue38%40%41%42%43%SOURCE: IBM QUARTERLY REPORTS.If this deceleration continues, we could see IBM's SI revenue growth drop to the single digits before its weight on the top line crosses the 50% mark.3. Being crushed by Amazon and MicrosoftIBM claims that its cloud businesses has an annual run rate of $15.1 billion. At first glance, that figure looks comparable to Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) annual run rate of about $15 billion for AWS (Amazon Web Services), or Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) annual run rate of $18.9 billion for its commercial cloud business.But a large portion of IBM's cloud revenue comes from its slower-growth private and hybrid clouds. The higher-growth ""cloud as a service"" segment, which competes against Microsoft and Amazon, had an annual run rate of just $8.8 billion. That's disappointing when we consider that most of Microsoft's commercial cloud revenues come from cloud services like Office 365, Dynamics, and its infrastructure platform Azure.SOURCE: GETTY.Meanwhile, Amazon's AWS is the largest cloud infrastructure platform in the world. IBM's comparable platform, Bluemix, only generates a small (and undisclosed) percentage of the $8.4 billion in technology and cloud platform revenues that it reported last quarter.Simply put, IBM remains far behind Amazon and Microsoft in the faster growing parts of the cloud market. That's disappointing considering how frequently IBM highlights its next-gen cloud services -- which include its AI platform Watson, quantum computing platform, and blockchain-powered security solutions.4. A lack of insider and investor confidenceIf IBM were on the brink of reporting top line growth again, we should see a lot of insider buys. After all, the stock trades at just 12 times earnings (compared to the industry average of 19 for IT services companies), pays a solid forward dividend of 4.1%, and is trading at a 52-week low.Yet IBM insiders have sold over 140,000 shares on the open market over the past 12 months, compared to purchases of just under 62,000 shares. And it's not just the insiders who are selling -- Warren Buffett, who held IBM as one of Berkshire Hathaway's top holdings, sold about 30% of his position when the stock hit $180 in February.The key takeawaysBack in May, I told investors that it would be a mistake to sell IBM. The stock has slipped about 3% since that article was published, but I still believe that its downside potential is limited by its low valuation and high yield.However, IBM's upside potential is also limited by its lack of sales growth and its inability to counter Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud services market. Those problems will weigh on Big Blue for many quarters to come, and the stock will likely underperform the broader market.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

IBM Hands Investors Another Mixed Bag,"Jul 19, 2017 at 2:00PM","Following a disappointing first-quarter report in April, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) provided an encore performance on Tuesday. A 4.7% year-over-year drop in revenue was worse than analysts were expecting, with every segment reporting a decline. IBM's strategic imperatives, which includes growth businesses like cloud computing, analytics, and security, grew sales by just 5% year over year, or 7% adjusted for currency.It wasn't all bad news. IBM handily beat analyst estimates for earnings, reporting adjusted EPS of $2.97, $0.23 ahead of expectations. The company also reiterated its full-year guidance, which calls for adjusted EPS of at least $13.80, and roughly flat free cash flow year over year. IBM expects the second half of the year to be stronger than the first, driven by service contract signings, including a $1.7 billion cloud services deal with Lloyds, the launch of the new IBM Z mainframe, and an upcoming refresh of its Power servers.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.IBM's mixed second quarter drew some analyst downgrades. Cantor Fitzgerald kept the stock at neutral, but knocked its price target down from $166 to $154. This comes a few days after Jefferies maintained its underperform rating on the stock but slashed its price target from $154 to $125.Here are a few key points from IBM's second-quarter report.Revenue keeps fallingThe second quarter marks the 21st consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue declines for IBM. Currency played a role, with revenue adjusted for currency declining by just 3.3%. But this result continues a long streak that investors would no doubt like to forget.DATA SOURCE: IBM. CHART BY AUTHOR.One thing to remember about IBM is that revenue growth isn't the main goal. CFO Martin Schroeter, appearing on CNBC's Closing Bell on Tuesday, reiterated this point: ""It's easy to get revenue in an enterprise space. It's finding the profit that we're focused on.""This is a similar statement as one made by IBM CEO Virginia Rometty during a conference in late 2015:What's important is that we grow in the right areas. Tech is littered with areas that you can have high growth and make no money. That's not us.In a market where tech companies with quick growth and big losses are given premium valuations, IBM is a fish out of water. Revenue growth will need to return before IBM stock can truly recover.A strategic imperatives slowdownAfter a long streak of double-digit growth, IBM's growth businesses slowed down during the second quarter.CategoryRevenueGrowth (YOY)Analytics$5.1 billion6%Mobile$1.2 billion29%Security$0.6 billion5%Social$0.3 billion3%Cloud (spread throughout other categories)$3.9 billion17%DATA SOURCE: IBM. REVENUE GROWTH ADJUSTED FOR CURRENCY. IBM's cloud computing business still produced double-digit growth, and its cloud-as-a-service annual revenue run rate jumped 32% to $8.8 billion. Over the past 12 months, the cloud business produced $15.1 billion of revenue, and the strategic imperatives accounted for 43% of IBM's total revenue.IBM pointed out in its earnings presentation that growth in strategic imperatives reflected organic performance, so the slowdown may be the result of acquisitions not contributing as much as they did in prior quarters. Still, the story at IBM is that these strategic imperatives will eventually return the company to growth, so the end of double-digit growth is at least a little concerning.Earnings growthAt the end of the day, a company's value is based on its profits, not its revenue. IBM managed to grow its adjusted per-share earnings during the second quarter, producing EPS of $2.97, up about 1% year over year. This puts the company on pace to hit its full-year earnings guidance.Unfortunately, this earnings growth wasn't driven by the underlying business. IBM reported a GAAP tax rate of 4.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 9.2%, both knocked down due to discrete tax benefits. These benefits added $0.18 to the EPS. The good news: IBM would have still beaten analyst estimates even after backing out the lower tax rate. The bad news: earnings would have declined compared to the same period last year if not for the lower tax rate.While IBM sees adjusted earnings per share rising this year, that increase will be less meaningful for investors if it's not being driven by improvements in the business itself. What's clear from the second-quarter report is that IBM still has a lot of work to do. The second half will look better than the first, but the jury is still out on whether the company's transformation will ultimately be a success.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Can IBM Make a ""Quantum"" Leap?","Oct 5, 2017 at 6:45AM","We've all heard the narrative by now: IBM (NYSE:IBM) is in terminal decline, having fallen prey to younger, leaner companies such as Amazon. And even former cheerleader Warren Buffett is ditching the stock.To this point, IBM's revenue has been declining for 21 straight quarters, and many of the company's high-touch, high-cost offerings have become increasingly commoditized by cloud computing. While the Jeopardy-winning Watson product was supposed to be the company's next big thing, it's not showing up (yet, at least) in the company's revenues, and reports on some Watson pilot programs have not been entirely positive.However, while IBM may be hanging on to declining (but profitable) businesses and paddling hard to catch up in cloud computing, the company is also investing research dollars toward the next big thing. Here are a few moves IBM is making with an eye on the next century, not the next quarter.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Quantum leapsIBM researchers recently put out a paper describing a breakthrough in their quantum-computing research lab. While a traditional computer uses ones and zeroes, or ""bits,"" to store information, quantum computing uses ""qubits"" in which a one and a zero are present at the same time in a superposition state. That enables a quantum computer to process much more information than a traditional computer or even a supercomputer. IBM is pioneering research in the field, although other tech giants like Google and Microsoft are also experimenting with quantum computing.In a recent paper, IBM researchers were able to write an algorithm that harnesses quantum computing's power to ""derive the lowest energy state of a molecule of beryllium hydride.""While that may not seem like much, it's important because deriving an energy state of a large molecule allows researchers to understand complex chemical reactions. This research may pave the way for the development of new pharmaceutical drugs and other advanced materials.IBM invests in MITAnother major recent announcement was IBM's investment of $240 million over a 10-year period to establish the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, where IBM researchers and students will work on next-generation artificial intelligence solutions. It's unclear who will own the intellectual property of the venture, although I would imagine it would be shared among students and the company in some way.According to IBM's vice president of artificial intelligence Dario Gil, ""The core mission of [the] joint lab is to bring together MIT scientists and IBM ... to shape the future of AI and push the frontiers of science.""What's the impact?These moves clearly show that 107-year-old IBM is looking to get younger by focusing on new technologies that will impact the next generation. Skeptics may say (and would not be entirely wrong) that IBM must do this because it missed out on the current generation's leading technologies, or at least missed out becoming a leader with strong franchises.However, I think investors should be encouraged. First, the cost impacts of these investments are rather low. The $240 million the company is setting aside to partner with MIT over 10 years is a negligible portion of IBM's $6 billion annual research-and-development budget. Moreover, working on exciting new technologies is a good way to attract young talent, and IBM has more competition than ever for engineers and developers these days. A good way to get a leg up on the competition, of course, is to establish relationships with talented individuals while they are still in college or graduate school.Finally, there could (eventually) be a significant business payoff. Shareholders, of course, should not expect anything this quarter or even in the next few years -- but at the very least, new research should bolster IBM's leading patent trove. In 2016, IBM's ""intellectual property and custom development income,"" from patent sales and licensing, amounted to $1.6 billion, or a significant 13% of the company's operating income.Moreover, it's likely IBM will acquire shares in the start-ups that come out of the MIT venture, and these start-ups could one day become successful companies in their own right.A reason to buy?It's tough to judge the cross-currents of IBM's struggling legacy businesses along with the prospects of potential technology breakthroughs. To me, IBM remains one of the most interesting companies in the market, as it trades at only 11.8 times earnings and has a dividend over 4%. Yet it faces more uncertainty than a typical large-cap dividend stock.At this valuation, IBM is weirdly both attractive to income- and growth-oriented investors. If its to live up to expectations for either set of investors, it needs strong footholds in the next age of tech, and these initiatives certainly help.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

IBM Is Beating Microsoft in This Emerging Tech,"Sep 21, 2017 at 3:31PM","Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is usually considered a better ""mature tech"" play than IBM (NYSE:IBM) for a few simple reasons: Microsoft pivoted from its aging OS and productivity software businesses toward higher-growth cloud services, and it consistently reports positive revenue growth. IBM tried to pivot away from its legacy businesses with higher-growth cloud services, but it's posted 21 straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines.The two companies' fortunes should continue to diverge -- analysts expect Microsoft's revenue to rise 8% this year and for IBM's to drop 3%. That's probably why Microsoft stock rallied more than 20% this year, while IBM's fell over 10%.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.At first glance, Microsoft is crushing Big Blue in next-gen markets like the cloud. Its Azure cloud platform generates much more revenue than IBM's Bluemix, and is currently the second-largest cloud platform after Amazon.com's Amazon Web Services (AWS).But IBM is still holding its ground in several key technologies. These areas including machine learning and artificial intelligence with Watson, quantum computing systems, and blockchain -- the technology best known for the creation of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. In fact, Juniper Research recently reported that over 40% of executives in blockchain-related businesses saw IBM as the top blockchain player, while only 20% said the same about Microsoft.Why that's good news for IBMBeing a top blockchain player doesn't mean that IBM will start mining bitcoins for revenue. Instead, it means that IBM's blockchain technology could help major companies streamline their operations.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.A blockchain is a decentralized log of data that is spread out across various locations. The data is secured in encrypted ""blocks,"" which are accessed through a peer-to-peer network. The original blockchain was a distributed ledger for bitcoin transactions, and the encryption of the blocks makes the transactions tamper-proof.However, blockchain can also be used to secure enterprise networks and trace transactions. For example, IBM recently announced partnerships with Wal-Mart, Unilever, and Nestle to trace the origins of their produce through a blockchain ledger.That system, IBM claims, can trace contaminated food within seconds and ""provide transparency"" across the entire food supply ecosystem. During a shareholder meeting in June, Wal-Mart food safety VP Frank Yiannas demonstrated IBM's blockchain technology tracking the condition and origin of a product in 2.2 seconds -- a process that would have taken nearly a week with previous methods.But that's not all -- IBM also recently signed blockchain partnerships with shipping company Maersk to improve its logistics, as well as seven leading European banks to facilitate international trade for small to medium-sized businesses. That list should grow longer in the future, since Juniper Research previously reported that 57% of the world's large corporations were considering the deployment of blockchain solutions for various purposes.But will blockchain really move the needle for IBM?IBM's progress with blockchain sounds great, but investors have probably grown accustomed to the company making big announcements that don't really move the needle. IBM announced plenty of partnerships with companies in the cloud, analytics, and AI markets, but none of those deals produced a single quarter of sales growth in over five years.Moreover, the year-over-year growth of IBM's ""strategic imperatives"" (cloud, mobile, social, analytics, and security) has slowed down in recent quarters, torpedoing the bullish notion that its higher-growth businesses can offset the softness of its legacy (IT services, business software, and hardware) businesses.Nonetheless, the increased adoption of IBM's blockchain solutions could strengthen its older global business services and technology/cloud platform services units, and potentially expand Big Blue's enterprise ecosystem. Investors should also remember that the vast majority of the world's biggest banks, telcos, and retailers still use IBM services -- so it has plenty of room to expand its blockchain business.Therefore, IBM's lead in the blockchain market might not matter over the next few quarters, but it could widen its moat as more companies secure and streamline their businesses with blockchain solutions."
How Safe Is IBM's Dividend?,"Jul 11, 2017 at 11:07AM","With a 3.9% yield, 22 consecutive years of dividend growth, and an average annual payout increase of 16.3% over the last decade, International Business Machine's (NYSE:IBM) returned income profile is one of the most compelling reasons to own the stock. However, the company is also undergoing a transition to counteract declining sales for its legacy hardware and services businesses, and that creates some uncertainty as to whether Big Blue's dividend is still the sure thing that it has been over the last two decades. Can investors count on IBM to continue its stellar dividend history in light of these challenges?IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Big Blue's business outlookAs more computing and storage functions are moved to the cloud, IBM's hardware offerings face mounting pressure, which, in turn, also negatively affects its software and services businesses. IBM has seen overall revenues decline for 20 consecutive quarters, with sales down roughly 30% over the stretch and now at their lowest point in 15 years. A reliable track record of payout increases is a quality income investors should prize, but a great dividend history isn't worth much without the business to sustain it.To the company's credit, IBM has a history of innovation and appears to have many of the necessary pieces in place for a successful turnaround. Its investments in cloud, analytics, security, mobile, and social (a group of businesses that the company calls ""strategic imperatives"") are yielding promising results, and these growth categories look to give the company some resilience even if hardware sales suffer a quicker-than-anticipated decline.Combined strategic imperatives revenues grew 12% year over year in the first quarter and have brought in $33.6 billion over the trailing-12-month period to reach 42% of revenue. That puts the company ahead of its target of having these businesses constitute 40% of sales by 2018, and IBM has also indicated that it's ahead of schedule on reaching $40 billion in sales from its strategic imperatives businesses in the next fiscal year. Whether these gains will be enough to offset legacy business declines remains to be seen, but the company does have feasible avenues back to long-term growth despite its deteriorating legacy components.   The debt pictureIBM closed its last quarter with $10.7 billion in cash and short-term assets against a debt of $42.8 billion. Here's a look at the trajectory of the company's net debt over the last decade:IBM NET TOTAL LONG TERM DEBT (ANNUAL) DATA BY YCHARTS.The company's investments in growth businesses combined with share buybacks and the cost of distributing its dividend have added debt to the books; however, the picture isn't as bad as it might look. Roughly two-thirds of the company's debt is tied up in the company's financing business, IBM Credit, and while this debt still presents some risk in the event of loans the company has made being written off, it does a lot to reframe Big Blue's debt picture. With global financing debt taken out, the company is holding roughly $14.3 billion in other debt -- not particularly worrying in the context of its cash and short-term investment holdings and free cash flow (FCF). The dividend and value picture going forwardFrom 2004 to 2015, IBM delivered double-digit dividend growth annually, but payout increases have slowed over the last couple years. 2016's and 2017's respective increases of 7.7% and 7.1% still delivered solid growth, but the slowdown points to the likelihood of smaller dividend growth in the near term.The trailing-12-month period has seen IBM generate roughly $11.5 billion in free cash flow, a hefty sum and enough to cover its forward dividend payout twice over. However, FCF has been trending downward amid softening legacy hardware and software sales and investments to transform its business for the future. IBM FREE CASH FLOW (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.While maximizing shareholder value has been a guiding principle at the company over the last decade, investors probably shouldn't buy the stock with expectations of a return to consistent double-digit dividend growth until the effects of its turnaround become more pronounced. That said, the company already boasts an impressive yield and will likely continue to add to its history of annual payout increases.Trading at roughly 11 times forward earnings, IBM looks like a worthwhile investment even in light of the considerable challenges it faces in modernizing its business, and it deserves strong consideration if you're looking for an income play in the tech sector."
Will IBM Ever Be a Great Dividend Stock Again? 1 Analyst Thinks So,"Jul 20, 2017 at 12:37PM","Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...Pity IBM (NYSE:IBM) stockholders. After reporting earnings Tuesday evening, shares of International Business Machines promptly slid 4.2% in Wednesday trading. Over the past year, the S&P 500 is up nearly 14% -- but as of today, IBM stock is down more than 4%. Even with IBM paying a massive dividend yield of 4.1%, investors who've held this stock for a year are sitting on a loss.But perhaps not for long. Here are three things you need to know about that.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.1. Taking a stand on IBMMany investors are fleeing IBM stock this week. But as reported today on StreetInsider.com (requires subscription), veteran stock market analyst Standpoint Research is viewing this panic as an opportunity. Arguing that no stock can fall forever, Standpoint planted its flag in IBM stock this morning. The analyst assigned IBM (currently at $147 and change) a $180 price target and declared the stock a buy.Why?2. Reversion -- what it meansA confirmed fan of the ""reversion to the mean theory"" of investing, Standpoint Research operates on the supposition that great stocks tend to outperform the average performance on the S&P 500 and lousy stocks tend to underperform it -- but over long periods of time, most stocks track the performance of the S&P 500 stock market average. When a great company like IBM lags too far behind, therefore, Standpoint often makes a wager on the stock eventually catching up -- rather than the rest of the market slowing down.It's a simple theory, but like many things simple, it evidently works really well for Standpoint. According to our data here at Motley Fool CAPS, following this approach has helped Standpoint Research rack up a record of nearly 70% accuracy (69.57% to be precise) on its picks -- and this is on a record that stretches back more than a decade.3. Why IBM might revertSo why might it work really well in IBM's case? IBM's gross and operating profit margins are entering their third straight year of continuing declines. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, IBM boasted a gross profit margin of 50% as recently as 2014, but that number has slipped to 46.5% over the past 12-month period. Operating profit margin has suffered even more, falling from 21.7% to 17.2% over the same period -- a drop of 450 basis points.And yet, Standpoint believes that ""margins may have bottomed out and stabilized"" for IBM. Although down again year over year in IBM's Q2 report, both gross and operating profit margins (and net margin, too) are up sequentially. Standpoint's ""bet"" is that ""a margin bounce ... could get the share price back near $180 by 2018-2019.""The most important thing: Valuing IBMIs Standpoint right about IBM's impending ""margin bounce""? It could well be. In IBM's after-earnings conference call with analysts, CFO Martin Schroeter noted that IBM's ""gross margin is up over two-and-a-half points sequentially,"" and predicted ""improved performance in revenue and gross margin in the second half"" of 2017.For the full year, IBM says it expects to earn $11.95 in net profit, with free cash flow equal to last year's $13.4 billion -- which would be an improvement over the $12.2 billion in cash that IBM generated over the last 12 months.Valued on earnings, IBM stock now sells for 12.3 times that current-year earnings projection. Valued on free cash flow, the stock sells for 10.3 times FCF. Those don't seem to be expensive valuations, except for two things:First, valuations based on market capitalization alone don't take into account IBM's $33.4 billion in net debt on its balance sheet. Factor that debt into your calculations, and IBM stock is arguably about 24% more expensive than its market cap alone makes it look. Second, while Standpoint seems convinced IBM's margins will bounce, and management backs it up, other analysts aren't so sure. Morningstar projections call for the S&P 500 as a whole to grow earnings at about 9.6% annually over the next five years. But the projection for IBM stock in particular is for much more muted 4% annualized growth.If Standpoint is right, and IBM stock succeeds in growing at least as fast as the rest of the stock market, then with its 4.1% dividend yield I'd say there's at least a case to be made that IBM is selling for close to fair value. But if the best IBM can achieve is only 4% growth, it may be safer to stay away."
4 Reasons International Business Machines Corporation Stock Could Fall,"Jun 23, 2017 at 9:47AM","Last quarter took the wind out of IBM's (NYSE:IBM) sails. Though IBM was hardly skyrocketing, its stock was at $170 a share ahead of first-quarter earnings and shareholders were enjoying a slight increase in 2017. After sharing another quarter of total revenue declines, IBM shares have since dropped 10% and are now in the red year to date.The recent decreases could be viewed as an opportunity for value investors, but that's only if CEO Ginni Rometty and team are able to avoid a few pitfalls that could result in a turn for the worse, particularly considering its somewhat tenuous position with Wall Street.The slump must endInvestors who follow IBM couldn't help but hear about its five-year run of year-over-year quarterly revenue slides. The $18.2 billion in sales IBM reported last quarter was a 3% drop and started a sell-off. Whether it was warranted or not, the simple fact is that total revenue is going to be under a microscope until IBM can turn the negative tide.To right the ship, IBM will need to rely on the success of its all-important transition away from legacy hardware and enterprise solutions and start hitting a few more home runs from its strategic imperatives initiative. IBM is relying heavily on its new-ish shift to all things cloud, analytics, data security, and mobile, which brings us to the second reason its stock could fall.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Light at the end of the tunnelOne bright spot from last quarter that was overshadowed by the dip in total sales was growth in IBM's strategic imperatives revenue. IBM generated a combined $7.8 billion from its key segments, a 12% improvement over a year-ago. Cloud-related revenue rose to an annual run rate of $14.6 billion, putting IBM on a short list of the world's largest providers in the burgeoning market.If IBM isn't able to post continued growth in strategic imperatives to at least somewhat offset its overall sales declines, the bears will really have a field day. IBM's key units will likely keep inching up with each passing quarter, but if they don't? IBM shareholders will learn the light at the end of the tunnel is a train, not salvation.A crowded playing fieldGiven the seemingly limitless opportunity the cloud, cognitive computing -- sometimes referred to as artificial intelligence or machine learning -- and analytics represent, IBM is facing stiff competition from some of the biggest tech players on the planet. One of the few providers that can boast a higher annual cloud revenue run rate than IBM is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) with over $15.2 billion as of last quarter.Competition from Microsoft, along with other industry leaders including Alphabet, doesn't end in the cloud. Microsoft recently earned an upgraded target price based on potential growth of its AI business. IBM is no stranger to competition from industry heavyweights, but with so much on the line, losing share to the competition would hit its stock hard.Change would breed uncertaintyRometty has a growing number of industry pundits calling for her removal. One of the biggest talking points coming from last month's IBM shareholders meeting was the narrowly approved 60% bump in pay to $33 million Rometty is now earning, making her one of the highest-paid CEOs in the country.Should the grumbling about Rometty pick up steam, the result could be a near-term stock price disaster for IBM. Uncertainties involving IBM's total revenue and the success of its strategic imperatives or lack thereof in some investors' minds are already pressuring its stock. A change in management would likely be seen as a positive by IBM bears, but the uncertainty it would bring could send its shares spiraling."
A Bull Case for IBM,"Oct 30, 2017 at 8:20PM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) has gotten kind of beaten down in the past few years, and more than a few analysts are bearish on the stock's prospects. However, there's plenty of indicators that the company still has a great runway for growth.In this Industry Focus segment, Motley Fool tech writer Tim Green explains why he's bullish on IBM's long-term potential. Listen in to find out what invaluable assets IBM has, and how they give them an edge against their competition; why dividend investors should definitely have this stock on their radar; some of IBM's most promising growth areas; what risks investors need to be aware of with the company; and more.A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and IBM wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.See the 10 stocks*Stock Advisor returns as of April 2, 2018This video was recorded on Oct. 20, 2017.Tim Green: I'm Tim Green. I write mostly about tech stocks. I'll be talking about International Business Machines. On the surface, the IBM the story does not look very exciting. Revenue has been slumping for the past five years. Earnings are down. The cloud computing business, one of its major growth initiatives, is being overshadowed by the two market leaders, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft Azure.But IBM has one big advantage that I think is being overlooked. Entire industries rely on its products, and it has long-standing relationships with major organizations in nearly every country. A few examples that drive home this point: 90% of global credit card transactions are processed by an IBM mainframe, which IBM has been selling for more than 50 years. Essentially all the world's largest banks use IBM products to run their infrastructures, and four-fifths of all travel reservations go through IBM's system. Its broad base of customer has allowed IBM to generate more than $12 billion of free cash flow each year, even as it invests in new businesses that it hopes will return it to growth.Its cloud strategy plays to this strength. IBM is focused on enterprise customers, high-value services, not simply growing revenue as fast as possible by renting commodity commuting resources. Earlier this year, IBM signed a 10-year cloud services deal worth about $1.7 billion with Lloyds Banking Group, a major U.K. bank. This will be a minor part of IBM's total revenue, but it represents exactly the kind of deal that will drive growth in IBM's cloud business. The bank is big, with over a trillion dollars of assets. It's a long-standing IBM customer, and the deal represents a brand-new revenue stream with IBM not only hosting applications in its cloud, but also managing migration of those applications.IBM has also struck deals to build platforms based on blockchain, a distributed database technology that underlies cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. It's working with a consortium of major banks to build a blockchain-based platform for tracking international trades transactions, and it's working with foods companies like Wal-Mart and Nestle to use the technology to add transparency to the global food supply chain. Just like in its cloud computing business, IBM's existing relationships with many of these companies is a valuable asset, especially when dealing with such a new and unproven technology.None of this has helped IBM avoid a long slide in revenue, and it's hard to predict exactly when it will turn a corner. But with the stock trading for barely more than 10 times earnings guidance, I think the market is being far too pessimistic.Dylan Lewis: I think one of the important things to note with that pitch is, we had our writers' conference last week. Tim recorded his pitch, and, actually, Danny recorded his pitch on Netflix, before both companies reported earnings. Tim's IBM pick here looks even better when you consider the market's reaction to its most recent earnings report.Sarah Priestley: Yeah, Tim looks stellar after this. The earnings report came in, and they had a beat on earnings per share of $3.30, versus the $3.28 which was expected. Their revenue was better than expected, but still a decline for the past 22 quarters. Tim touched on that in his pitch; it continued.Lewis: That's the thing we're constantly watching with this company: Where will the bottom be for the revenue growth? And when will they stabilize and return to growth? I think people were pretty optimistic this most recent quarter, because the decline wasn't as much as maybe they had thought, which is tough to curb into a bull case.Priestley: Yeah, absolutely.Lewis: But really, I think what Tim's getting at here is, this company has been struggling for quite some time, but the floor is so high for this business because they're this entrenched player, they're already installed in so many businesses, that basically, you're getting this big business turnaround play at a fairly cheap price. And he mentioned valuation a little bit there. The stock has a trailing P/E of 13.5, which is practically half of what the market is trading at right now. And that's even after they were up 10% following earnings.Priestley: Yeah, absolutely. I think you described it before we came in: People were wondering whether they've hit the bottom of the earnings plateau, and I think that's exactly what people are expecting. And there were some highlights in their earnings. Strategic imperatives, which is their analytics, cloud, mobile, security, all of their new endeavors, grew 11% year over year, and that's 46% of their revenue, from this segment. A particular bright spot within that was cloud revenue, which grew 20%, which is actually incredible growth.Lewis: If you read through the earnings call for this company, you see them highlighting all these different growth factors. You just mentioned a couple right there. For them to consistently struggle with growing the top line, that obviously means that part of their business is not working.Priestley: Oh, yeah.Lewis: What's going on there, Sarah?Priestley: Core Technologies declined 8%. Within that, you have their technology services, which was down 3%. Global business services down 2%. A lot of this is exactly as it sounds, their legacy core infrastructure that they have established, and a lot of their long-term contracts. And part of the reason for this is, it's harder to make money than it used to be. It's harder to get those margins. Another reason is, it's just so much more competitive, and those two played together. But the other thing to note, and I'm sure you were going to touch on this, the big reason their earnings came in so well was their effective tax rate, which we were talking about yesterday.Lewis: It was, like, sub-15%. It's crazy.Priestley: It's 11%. It's the second-lowest tax rate in the Dow Jones. The only other company that has a lower tax rate on the Dow is GE. And the way that companies do this, as I'm sure a lot of people know, is through -- I don't want to use the word loopholes, [laughs] but it kind of is loopholes.Lewis: Creative accounting.Priestley: Creative accounting, yes. Kind of, transferring assets between business units, writedowns. In this case, it was transferring IP between business units.Lewis: One of the things that Tim didn't mention with his pitch that I think is pretty important with IBM is the dividend. You look at this company -- it has raised its dividend for 22 straight years. They're just short of that 25 that you need to be a Dividend Aristocrat, which is this vaunted dividend status. If you want more on that, we have a piece, as I'm sure Michael Douglass has told pretty much every Industry Focus listener at this point.Really, even not being a Dividend Aristocrat, IBM is one of the bankable tech dividends. And they're not going anywhere anytime soon. They're probably going to become a Dividend Aristocrat. I think they've been paying out dividend for over a hundred years; they just haven't consistently raised it long enough to be in that class.I mention this because, to me, IBM is far more compelling as an income investment, not necessarily a growth investment. You're getting a 3.75% yield on IBM shares currently. That's not too shabby. But we talked about how they have these growths drivers that are available to them, and yet, the struggle of the core business is so much that they haven't found that floor yet. And I worry, even when we get to the point where revenue is stabilized, what is actual revenue growth going to look like? Is it going to be in the low single digits? Because, if you're looking for growth investments, I don't know that IBM is the place to do it.Priestley: I would agree with you. I do think we shouldn't underestimate the base that IBM already has. It's a huge company. The scale is massive. Like you said, reading through the earnings report, trying to keep track of all the divisions that they have is difficult. They have this large, sticky core base of software and hardware legacy products, across 170 different companies. Just in the services business, they own 5.7% market share of this ginormous business globally, which is double the next person behind them.I think, while we shouldn't underestimate that, I 100% agree with you. I think there are so many companies now -- Microsoft, Oracle, Amazon -- jumping on these strategic initiatives around big data and machine learning, it's going to be really hard for them to deliver the margins that they have had before.Lewis: And it's a company where, if you're really interested in them, you have to go into it knowing what you're getting. You're going to be getting consistent dividend growth, maybe some share price appreciation now that the company has started to turn around. But with a $150 billion market cap company, it's much harder for them to double or triple the way that a smaller medium-size or small-cap company might be able to.Priestley: Yeah, and that's one of the issues for their clients, in the sense that it's such a big, huge behemoth company that, to try and understand how each of the divisions relates to one another, what services they need, it's very complex. And I think they're probably not leveraging a lot of the opportunity that they have between inter-divisional learning that they could be."
IBM Has Spent $3.6 Billion on Buy Backs This Year. Should Investors Be Happy?,"Oct 28, 2017 at 10:32AM","Some investors don't like the notion of companies buying back their own stock, regardless of the circumstances, whereas others love the concept. I've always taken a middle of the road stance on the topic: I think there's a right time, and a wrong time, for businesses with large cash hoards -- like IBM (NYSE:IBM) -- to pare down the number of shares outstanding.For example, initiating a share repurchase program can be an effective way to send investors a signal that even if a company's stock is under pressure in the near term, management has confidence that it will be able to right the ship.The question now at IBM is: Is the tech giant's use of ready cash for stock repurchases a sound, long-term move or a strategic mistake?IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.All the way, or no way at allShare buybacks have been the norm at IBM for years. It has repurchased nearly  $50 billion worth of its own stock over the past five years, including  $3.67 billion so far in 2017. For some perspective, it spent $2.63 billion on its stock in the first nine months of last year.For IBM, buying shares back this year has been a good move, and here's why:As it continues its transformation away from legacy hardware solutions and toward its ""strategic imperatives"" businesses -- which include the cloud, cognitive computing, mobile, and data security, as well as blockchain, and other cutting-edge markets -- its stock prices has meandered. Even factoring in the recent spike that followed IBM's third-quarter earnings release, its performance has been unimpressive.For the past five years, IBM stock is down 17% -- not exactly dire over a five-year period, but certainly, nothing to cheer, either. To the company's credit, the trend for the past month has been positive, with shares climbing 10%, but sustaining those good feelings will be a challenge.The reason IBM's stock performance is such a key factor in answering the question of whether its buyback strategy makes sense is the same reason value investors should give the stock a close look. The old maxim ""buy low, sell high"" is simplistic, but there's an underlying truth to it. IBM stock has been, and remains, a relative bargain, trading at a mere 13.5 times trailing earnings, less than half its peer average of 28.8.If CEO Ginni Rometty and her team can maintain the growth momentum in the strategic imperatives units, IBM could prove to be a long-term steal for value investors. And based on a number of shares bought back in 2017, Rometty certainly thinks IBM will get things turned around.Baby stepsOne of the few tech players that can boast a higher annual revenue run-rate than IBM in the cloud is longtime competitor and sometime partner  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). At $18.9 billion the past 12 months, Microsoft is one of leading cloud providers on the planet. But with a $15.8 billion annual run-rate of its own, IBM is nipping at Microsoft's heels.The good news for IBM and Microsoft -- and why they're among the leaders in this fast-growing space -- is that both have focused their growth initiatives in this arena on suites of software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions delivered via the cloud. That's where the real opportunity lies, and if current estimates about the growth curve for that market are anywhere close to accurate, there's more than enough room for both IBM and Microsoft to excel.Final thoughtsSkeptics may point to IBM's $41.2 billion in long-term debt as an indication of a less-than-stellar balance sheet. However, in today's borrower-friendly interest rate environment, IBM is hardly alone in taking advantage of low-cost funds. Not to mention, IBM offset some of its long-term debt by shaving over $3 billion off its short-term obligations. The upside is that between cash and marketable securities, IBM boasted  $11.5 billion on its balance sheet last quarter, so there's little chance its repurchase program will threaten its financial stability. Factor in its still-depressed stock price, and last quarter's strategic imperatives growth, and it looks like Rometty is right to continue IBM's ongoing bets on itself.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here's How IBM Expects to Grow,"Mar 12, 2018 at 9:12PM","Century-old tech giant International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) returned to revenue growth in the fourth quarter of last year, putting an end to a five-year streak of declines. This turnaround was driven by the launch of a new mainframe system and double-digit growth in the company's ""strategic imperative"" businesses, which include cloud computing and security.IBM held its annual investor briefing event last week, providing shareholders with long-term financial goals. The headline numbers didn't change from last year, but IBM gave some additional details on how it expects to hit those targets. Here's what investors need to know.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The big pictureInstead of trotting out targets tied to a specific year in the future, IBM provided a ""longer-term model"" with no time frame attached. That's probably a smart move given how badly the company fell short the last time it tried to get too specific with its outlook. Back in 2010, IBM called for adjusted earnings per share of $20 by 2015. The company eventually abandoned that goal in 2014, and it generated adjusted EPS of just $13.80 last year.The company's transformation has involved heavy investments in areas including cloud computing and artificial intelligence. This has knocked down profits, but it's also put IBM in a stronger competitive position. A carved-in-stone profit target provides little flexibility. IBM isn't making that mistake again.The longer-term model calls for low single-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit pre-tax income growth, and high single-digit earnings-per-share growth. About 70%-80% of free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders each year, with annual dividend increases and continued share buybacks on tap. The company expects to reduce its share count by roughly 2% annually.What will drive this growth?IBM's strategic imperatives will be responsible for offsetting decreases in the legacy portion of the business. In 2017, strategic imperative revenue jumped 11% year over year and accounted for 46% of total revenue. But total revenue still slumped by 1%.Its growth strategy revolves around its cloud business and, more specifically, its as-a-service business. IBM expects its as-a-service run rate to grow by 15% to 20% annually, with added scale boosting the as-a-service gross margin by 3 percentage points each year. The as-a-service run rate reached $10.3 billion at the end of 2017.On top of the margin expansion driven by growth in the as-a-service business, IBM expects the profitability of its services businesses to improve. IBM sees both its technology services and cloud platforms segment and its global business services segment producing 50 basis points of margin expansion annually. Workforce rebalancing will be part of the equation as IBM continues to bring on employees with the necessary skills. About 50% of all its employees were added in the past five years, partly through acquisitions.Share buybacks will provide a couple extra percentage points of per-share earnings growth, layering on top of the margin expansion and bringing the company's total annual EPS growth up to the high single digits -- assuming all goes according to plan.A new phase of the transformationIBM isn't slowing down on investing in growth areas. It will continue to build out its cloud and as-a-service businesses, with ""steady investment"" in capital expenses part of its longer-term model. The company also expects to make more acquisitions. Over the past six years, between research and development spending, capital expenditures, and acquisitions, IBM has invested $71 billion, with $37 billion of that total having come in the past three years alone.2018 will mark the start of those investments paying off in a visible way, with revenue growth returning and margin expansion expected. IBM's results will be choppy year to year -- it expects flat adjusted EPS this year, for example, thanks in part to a higher expected tax rate. But most of the numbers should start moving in the right direction.IBM's growth is never going to match the highfliers of the tech industry. But with the stock trading for just 11.5 times adjusted earnings, it doesn't need to in order for IBM to be a solid long-term investment.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

How IBM's Business Is Changing,"Mar 19, 2018 at 2:38PM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) has had an interesting run recently, returning to growth for the first time in 22 quarters. Still, the market remains skeptical, valuing the company at just 11.2 times forward earnings, and longtime shareholder Warren Buffett exited his entire position last quarter.In light of all these crosscurrents, management decided to give investors the first in what might be a series of investor presentations throughout this year. In it, management outlined the company's long-term vision, set new growth targets, and hosted a Q&A with 10 top executives.Here's the story they're trying to sell the Street. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.A shift in product mixThe most apparent way IBM is changing is in its product mix, shifting away from hardware to more of a software and services model. This follows overall trends in the IT industry, so IBM is really just keeping up with the times. Of course, IBM also handles the most mission-critical and private data for the very largest corporations, so it must also handle workloads built on legacy codes and equipment, in addition to innovating to new models and solutions.Modernizing these workloads takes effort, and the company has spent much of the last few years updating its product portfolio. Hardware has decreased from 25% of IBM's 2007 revenue to just 10% in 2017. This was partly due to the divestment of its PC and low-end server business in the 2000s, combined with the acquisition of roughly 34 companies, mostly in software and services, over the past three years. In addition, the way in which software is sold has changed, and over the past 10 years, IBM has moved from 47% recurring as-a-service revenue to 61% as-a-service revenue as of 2017. And 22% of revenue, or $17 billion of IBM's business, now occurs within the IBM cloud, up from just $4 billion a few years ago.Embedded in this mix are the company's Strategic Imperatives, which include analytics (especially cognitive computing), cloud, mobile, security, and social. The mix of Strategic Imperatives has grown strongly, from just 27% of revenue in 2014 to 46% of revenue last year.The howTo implement these changes, the company has overhauled internal processes and personnel -- 50% of the IBM workforce is new to the company within the last five years, and CFO James Kavanaugh pointed to a 35% reduction in corporate ""layers,"" which has sped up the organization.In addition to modernizing its workforce, management has also made sure new products are designed in a sleek, intuitive manner, almost like consumer products. To that end, the company hired 15,000 designers in the recent past, reallocated a lot of its real estate footprint to more open work spaces, and implemented internal net promoter scores for clients to better gauge customer satisfaction.These changes and tools mark a big difference from how IBM operated just a few years ago.Reallocating capitalAll of this work has, of course, taken some investment. IBM ramped investments in research & development, capital expenditures, and bolt-on acquisitions from $34 billion between 2012 and 2014 to $37 billion between 2015 and 2017, even as its revenue declined.    A clear shift began in 2015, when the company scrapped its earnings-per-share targets and heavily dialed back on share repurchases.The company will continue to invest, but now forecasts growth and operating leverage going forward, targeting low-single-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit pre-tax income growth, and high-single-digit EPS growth over the long term.Leading new technologiesOne of the criticisms of IBM has faced is that it was late to the cloud computing game. Perhaps vowing not to make the same mistake again, IBM is actually a first-mover in several exciting fields such as blockchain technology and quantum computing. As it has for the past 25 years, IBM led the tech industry in patents filed last year, with over 50% of the new patents in these emerging fields.How IBM is not changingWith all the new things going on at IBM, some things are not changing. The company still serves 95% of the Fortune 500, helping these large enterprises with their most mission-critical workloads and data. Therefore, all of these innovations are merely a means to the same end and same customer base. And even with all of these improvements, there's still a lot of skepticism around IBM's growth potential, as the current transition has already taken more than five years. Management has hinted at more presentations this year, so investors should stay tuned for new developments, and monitor the company's progress toward its new growth targets. 10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What You Need to Know About IBM's New Artificial Intelligence Platform,"Mar 24, 2018 at 12:32PM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) is in the middle of reinventing itself from a hardware company that sells servers to businesses, to a services company that provides platforms, analytics, and cloud computing to its customers. Sure, it still sells hardware, but IBM is continually looking ahead to a world where service revenue dominates its top line. To that end, IBM recently made an announcement about a new artificial intelligence (AI) platform it's launching, called Cloud Private for Data. The name doesn't necessarily roll off the tongue, but IBM says that this new data science and machine learning platform will make it easier for its customers to make data-driven decisions.""Designed to help companies uncover previously unobtainable insights from their data, the platform is also designed to enable users to build and exploit event-driven applications capable of analyzing the torrents of data from things like IoT sensors, online commerce, mobile devices, and more,"" the company said in a press release.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Cloud Private for Data is an application layer that helps companies gather the vast amounts of data they have, filter out what they really need, and then apply that data to machine learning and other AI projects.In short, IBM is trying to be the answer to the question many Fortune 500 companies are asking: ""How can we filter through all of the data we own and apply AI to make better decisions?"" The company believes that its new platform could help its customers reach their AI and decision-making goals.""Whether they are aware of it or not, every company is on a journey to AI as the ultimate driver of business transformation,"" IBM's general manager of analytics, Rob Thomas, said in the release.Why IBM is focused on AI analytics platformsIt's no secret that up until very recently, IBM's sales were a huge disappointment to investors. The company had 22 consecutive quarters of revenue declines until its fourth quarter 2017 (reported in late January), where sales ticked up 3.7% year over year.Part of the reversal has come from the company's movement away from its legacy hardware business and toward its recurring-services revenue. IBM now earns 61% of its top line from its as-a-service business. And the company recently noted in an investor presentation that its analytics, cognitive computing, cloud, and other ""Strategic Imperatives"" now make up 46% of the company's revenue, up from just 27% last year. All of this means that IBM knows that cloud computing, machine learning, and analytics are a big part of the company's future, and its new Cloud Private for Data platform is yet another step in that direction.Worldwide spending on cognitive and AI systems is forecast to reach $57.6 billion in 2021, according to market intelligence firm IDC, with discrete manufacturing, process manufacturing, healthcare, retail, and the banking industries expected to account for 55% of all spending by 2021. It's no surprise, then, that IBM said its Cloud Private for Data platform will have industry-specific solutions for financial services, healthcare, and manufacturing in the near future.It's still unclear how well IBM will be able to capture this growing cognitive computing market, but the company is certainly making progress by developing new platforms and solutions for its clients and by moving toward more recurring-services revenue. Whether investors will be patient enough to wait around for IBM's turnaround is another story. Shares are trading at just 11 times the company's forward earnings, but at least one famed billionaire investor, Warren Buffett, has already grown impatient with the tech giant's slow turnaround.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The 3 Biggest Mistakes Warren Buffett Made With IBM,"Feb 18, 2018 at 1:02PM","Warren Buffett is waving the white flag on IBM (NYSE:IBM). After years of touting the tech titan as one of his best ideas, Buffett ditched nearly all of his stake in the company this past quarter. His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), dumped 94.5% of its IBM stock, leaving it with 2.05 million shares, or about $300 million in the company. At one point, Berkshire's stake in Big Blue topped $10 billion. The move signals the end to an odyssey that began in 2011 when Buffett first bought shares of the IT specialist, surprising his followers as he had historically avoided tech stocks. The so-called Oracle of Omaha endorsed IBM due to its history of executing on earnings goals and called it a value play. However, IBM's share price has actually fallen 18% since he accumulated much of his stake at the end of 2011, while the S&P 500 has more than doubled in that time, gaining 116%.That poor result is a reminder that even the wisest of investors can make mistakes. Here are three of the biggest ones Buffett made when it came to IBM.IMAGE SOURCE: MOTLEY FOOL.1. Focusing on past achievementsBuffett explained his decision to buy IBM to CNBC in 2011, saying that the company had a pattern of laying out a road map of goals every five years, and consistently knocking them down. Buffett also gave credit to previous CEOs like Lou Gerstner and Sam Palmisano. However, in focusing on the company's track record and past management, he seemed to ignore the structural changes that were about to take place under new CEO Ginni Rometty as the company fought for position in cloud services and dumped its legacy businesses.Back in 2011, IBM guided for EPS of $20 a share by 2015, up from $11.52 in 2010. However, that goal soon became more of an albatross than a guiding light. The promise was made by Palmisano, but was tasked to Rometty, who was named CEO in 2011. During the intervening years, IBM's revenue growth turned negative as enterprise customers switched from traditional IT solutions — IBM's strength — to cloud-based technologies. To try to meet the goal, Rometty aggressively bought back shares, laid off workers, and sold divisions, but it wasn't enough, and the strategy hurt both morale and the company's performance. IBM eventually backed away from the $20 goal at the end of 2014, and ended up reporting just $14.92 in EPS in 2015. The lesson here seems to be that past performance does not determine the future, especially in a fast-changing industry like tech and also when a new CEO is at the helm.2. Cheering share buybacks Normally, investors aren't happy to see their stocks fall, but Buffett turned this logic on its head in his 2012 shareholder letter. ""We should wish for IBM's stock price to languish throughout the five years,"" he wrote, due to the company's penchant for share buybacks. Lower stock prices make share buybacks more efficient, of course, as they allow companies to repurchase a greater amount of shares for the same amount of money.However, Buffett seemed to be mistakenly focusing on the goal rather than the process. Share buybacks are easy to do, and are often a sign of management's lack of ideas. Prior to 2015, Rometty aggressively repurchased shares in the hopes of meeting the $20 EPS goal, but that did nothing to shore up the underlying business.In 2014, IBM spent more than $12 billion on buybacks, and for a time the company was spending more on buybacks and dividends than it was bringing in in free cash flow, funding the difference with new debt. Spending on research and development, though, was flat. The company lost ground to competitors, and its revenue and profits fell. Buffett got his wish for the share price to languish, but it did so as a direct reflection of IBM's worsening performance and competitive position. For IBM and Buffett, the focus on share buybacks was a strategic mistake.  3. Straying from his expertiseBuffett had long refused to invest in tech companies, claiming that he doesn't know how to value them, and that due to the changeable nature of the industry, their futures are difficult to predict.In 1996, during the internet boom, he wrote in his annual letter to shareholders, ""We are searching for operations that we believe are virtually certain to possess enormous competitive strength ten or twenty years from now. A fast-changing industry environment may offer the chance for huge wins, but it precludes the certainty we seek.""  That ""fast-changing industry environment"" seems to be what torched his investment in IBM.Historically, Buffett has focused on relatively simple, consistent businesses like banking and insurance companies, energy producers, and consumer goods companies like Coca-Cola. Notably, Berkshire increased in its investment in Apple and the same time it dumped IBM. With its reliance on the iPhone, Apple may be easier to model than most tech companies, but the sector is always going to be more unpredictable than the corners of the market that Buffett generally favors. That may be a lesson worth remembering for his followers and investors as well. 10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

IBM Enters the Smart Assistant Market,"Mar 26, 2018 at 7:16AM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) recently introduced Watson Assistant, its play on the growing smart assistant market, at its Think 2018 Conference in Las Vegas. Unlike consumer-facing assistants -- like Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri, and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Assistant -- Watson Assistant targets the enterprise market.Watson Assistant represents an expansion of IBM's Watson AI platform. The company won't install Watson Assistant onto just any branded smart speakers. Instead, it plans to offer it to companies as a customized service.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Big Blue's early partners include the Munich Airport, where Watson Assistant powers a Pepper robot that offers directions; Samsung's HARMAN Kardon, which is integrating Watson into a voice assistant for a Maserati concept car; and Chameleon Technologies, which is integrating Watson-powered voice technologies into a smart home meter.Flexibility in a market of sprawling ecosystemsWatson Assistant isn't exactly a new product. It bundles together a combination of existing IBM products, like Watson Conversation and Watson Virtual Assistant, with some language and conversation analytics APIs.However, IBM hopes that companies will use Watson Assistant as a foundation for creating customized voice assistants in cars, stores, and hotel rooms -- which could offer much more flexibility than Amazon, Apple, and Google's consumer-facing assistants.That could also be a smart approach for companies that don't want to tether themselves or their customer data to those tech companies' ecosystems. IBM notes that each separate integration of Watson Assistant keeps its data to itself, so IBM isn't gathering a huge pool for other analytics purposes.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Speaking to The Verge, IBM Watson IoT VP Bret Greenstein stated: ""If you start running the entire world through Alexa, it's an enormous amount of data and control to give to one company.""The tech world recently witnessed those potential consequences with Facebook's recent leak of user data from about 50 million accounts to data firm Cambridge Analytica.IBM is also currently the market leader in blockchain technologies, which can be used to secure peer-to-peer transactions. The combination of Watson AI and blockchain, which IBM already offers on its Watson IoT (Internet of Things) platform, could make Watson Assistant an appealing option for security-minded enterprise customers.What Watson Assistant means to IBMOver the past few years, IBM focused on growing its ""strategic imperatives"" -- the cloud, analytics, mobile, security and social businesses -- to offset the sluggish growth of its legacy business hardware, software, and IT services units.That turnaround was glacial, but IBM's rising strategic imperatives revenue finally helped Big Blue break a 22-quarter streak of annual revenue declines with 4% sales growth (1% growth on a constant currency basis) during the fourth quarter of 2017.Analysts expect IBM to report 1% sales growth and roughly flat earnings growth this year. Those numbers might sound anemic, but they indicate that IBM's investments in next-gen technologies are paying off.Back in 2014, IBM invested $1 billion in the creation of a dedicated business unit for Watson. In 2016, it set aside another $3 billion to groom Watson for the expanding IoT market. Watson has already been integrated into AI solutions for various industries, including healthcare, cybersecurity, education, weather forecasts, and even fashion design.IBM doesn't disclose Watson's stand-alone revenues. The platform is included in its Cognitive Solutions group, which includes other business software. That unit's revenue rose 3% annually (flat on a constant currency basis) and accounted for 7% of IBM's top line. The company noted that rising revenues from Watson solutions and security was partly offset by softer demand for its traditional analytics products.The road aheadIt's unclear if Watson Assistant will gain enough traction in the smart assistant market. But its flexibility, security, and lack of ecosystem puppet strings could make it an attractive choice for enterprise customers.However, investors shouldn't read too much into the news and assume this means IBM is gearing up to tackle Amazon, since it's pursuing a completely different market."
3 Tailwinds for IBM in 2018,"Jan 3, 2018 at 8:00AM","International Business Machines'(NYSE:IBM) investors had a rough 2017. The stock slumped about 7.5% in a year when the major indices posted double-digit gains. The company's turnaround efforts, while showing signs of progress, failed to produce growth through the first nine months of the year. Five years of declining revenue is a tough sell.2018 has the potential to be quite a bit better for IBM. The company expects to produce revenue growth during the fourth quarter of 2017, and it will announce these results in January. If it can keep that momentum going, 2017 will mark the official bottom for Big Blue. Three tailwinds will help the cause this year, each contributing to IBM's return to growth.THE Z14 MAINFRAME SYSTEM. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.The mainframeEvery 2 1/2 years or so, IBM launches a brand-new mainframe system. This triggers IBM's install base to upgrade, creating a spike in sales. The sales bump typically lasts for four quarters, after which sales decline as the launch is lapped. Each mainframe launch also drives sales in related businesses. Around 90% of mainframe systems are financed, so new mainframes provide a boost to financing volume. And IBM sells plenty of software and services to mainframe customers, as well.IBM announced its latest mainframe system, the z14, in July 2017. The system began shipping near the end of the third quarter, driving a 62% year-over-year increase in mainframe sales. The fourth quarter should also see a big boost to sales, with smaller increases in the first half of 2018.The mainframe is the main reason IBM expects to grow fourth-quarter revenue. The sales boost in the first half of 2018 won't be as big, but combined with the other tailwinds and the continued growth of IBM's ""strategic imperatives,"" it might be enough to push total revenue higher.POWER9The mainframe isn't the only piece of hardware that IBM sells. The company also sells Power systems, built around its POWER processors. These servers provide an alternative to the Intel-based systems that dominate the market.Prior to 2013, the only way to buy a system with a POWER processor was directly from IBM. This changed with the OpenPOWER foundation, a consortium of companies aiming to build an ecosystem around the POWER architecture. IBM began allowing third parties to build POWER-based systems, and it began pushing its chips for use in hyperscale data centers.IBM announced the first system featuring its new POWER9 processor in December. The system is designed for artificial-intelligence workloads, providing a massive data throughput boost compared to Intel-based systems. These new Power systems could drive growth in IBM's Power business in 2018.The longer-term story revolves around IBM's efforts to get its chips into data centers. Alphabet's Google announced in 2016 that it was building a server architecture based on the POWER9 processor. We should see more news on the data-center front this year, although winning market share from Intel won't be easy or quick.Still, the new POWER9 processor and Power systems will act as another tailwind for IBM in 2018.CurrencyAround 2/3 of IBM's annual revenue is produced outside the United States. Because IBM reports its results in U.S. dollars, swings in foreign-exchange rates can lead to swings in revenue. The U.S. dollar strengthened against other currencies in 2014 and 2015, wreaking havoc on IBM's top line. During the third quarter of 2015, for example, IBM reported a whopping 14% year-over-year decline in revenue. But 9 percentage points of that decline was due to currency, with another 4 percentage points due to divested businesses.Currency is a two-way street, so if the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, IBM's top line will benefit. 2017 was the worst year for the U.S. dollar since 2003, and further weakening in 2018 would provide a boost to IBM's top line. Even a small tailwind is meaningful -- a 1 percentage point benefit translates to around $800 million of additional annual reported revenue.Revenue growth from currency isn't ""real,"" in the sense that it's not being generated by winning additional business. But it sure makes the numbers look better at a time when the market needs some convincing that IBM's turnaround will be a success.IBM expects to produce at least $13.80 in adjusted earnings in 2017, putting the price-to-earnings ratio at just over 11. The stock also pays a 3.9% dividend, with a 22-year record of raising that dividend. Investors have been put off by IBM's streak of revenue declines, but with 2018 shaping up to be a solid year for the tech giant, it's not too late to jump in on this bargain stock."
IBM Reaches a Milestone,"Jan 31, 2018 at 2:20PM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) shareholders have been very patient over the years while the stock has lagged the broader markets. During that time, IBM has worked extremely hard to develop new products, as many of its legacy offerings have declined amid competition and/or technological change. That led to 22 straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines, which is not what investors had been looking for in this growth-obsessed market.However, IBM's recent earnings report marked a milestone five years in the making: a return to revenue growth. In the fourth quarter, revenue grew 3.7% year over year, and while this was helped by a currency tailwind, the company still posted 1% growth with currency stripped out. Still, skeptics found things to be concerned about. Here's what investors need to know. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.A story with multiple partsCritics will likely point to the outsized impact in the just-reported quarter of the systems segment, which includes systems hardware and operating systems hardware. The fourth quarter saw the first full quarter of sales of IBM's new z14 mainframe, which was just released in September. The new mainframe, with automated end-to-end encryption, has been very well received by IBM's customers, and is a feature of IBM's cloud data centers. In addition to the mainframe, sales of IBM's flash storage products and Power processors also grew, contributing to 28% growth in this segment.Aside from systems, the other three main segments all posted revenue declines or no change in revenue.SegmentRevenue Growth/(Drop) (YOY)Total Revenue in Q4Cognitive Solutions0%$5.4 billionGlobal Business Services(2%)$4.2 billionTechnology Services and Cloud Platforms(4%)$9.2 billionSystems28%$3.3 billionGROWTH FIGURES ADJUSTED FOR CURRENCY. YOY - YEAR-OVER-YEAR. DATA SOURCE: IBM.Some analysts may doubt that systems revenue growth is sustainable, attributing the increase to the timing of a new product introduction. On this point, management pushed back (all conference call quotes are via Seeking Alpha):... the demand for mainframe is driven by the secular trend for security. It is not so much about, like, there's a new mainframe, so I have to buy one. It's not so much in POWER9 that, Oh, there's a new POWER9. I have to buy it. ... we introduced those shifts and those secular ideas through the strategic imperatives, and all of these offerings are riding that secular trend. ... the cyclical versus secular is not as simple as some want to portray it. Management wants to stress that every systems refresh incorporates elements of existing secular trends, like heightened security features. Therefore, management thinks systems revenue is more stable over the long term, and not dependent on a single hit product every so often.Speaking of imperativesIn 2015, IBM unveiled its ""strategic imperatives"" around analytics, cloud, security, and mobile, to highlight the big growth drivers in IT. These imperatives are present within each segment, and overall, strategic imperatives revenue grew 17% (14% in constant currency) in the most recent quarter, making up 46% of trailing-12-month revenue, up from 45% last quarter.And within each segment, there are legacy products combined with strategic imperatives. Fortunately, IBM does break out strategic imperative growth in each sub-segment for shareholders. Here's the breakdown:SegmentQ4 Total RevenueStrategic Imperatives Growth/(Drop) Within SegmentStrategic Imperatives Revenue Within SegmentCognitive Solutions$5.4 billion(3%)$3.5 billionGlobal Business Services$4.2 billion7%$2.6 billionTechnology Services and Cloud Platform$9.2 billion12%$2.9 billionSystems$3.3 billion86%$2.1 billionTotal$22.1 billion  $11.1 billionDATA SOURCE: IBM.IBM also earned $450 million in global financing revenue this quarter, but as you can see, strategic imperatives revenue makes up more than half of nonfinancing revenue, which is a promising sign. One point of caution may be in the cognitive solutions segment, where strategic imperatives revenue actually declined, and which is also the segment with the biggest amount of strategic imperatives revenue. On that question, management said, ""Where we saw weakness [in cognitive] ... was in a couple of traditional analytics offerings like data integration and content management where we either have to go spend some more time getting those offerings better developed ... or we're shifting some of those license models to as-a-service."" The specialized cognitive offerings in which IBM has invested -- Watson and security -- did grow in the quarter, but these more ""traditional,"" or generic, products lagged. That's not a surprise, as certain products and services, such as data integration, are experiencing challenges due to the rise of new technologies.Looking aheadWhile much of the discussion during the conference call with analysts was around margins and tax rates, it was a positive to see the company return to growth. While the 1% growth rate was modest and there is still work to do, the positives seem to be outweighing the negatives in my eyes, and that is certainly a welcome sign.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Can Google Catch Up to IBM and Microsoft in Blockchain?,"Mar 29, 2018 at 9:08AM","Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is developing a blockchain service to support its cloud business, according to Bloomberg. Google plans to offer the service on its Google Cloud Platform, as well as a stand-alone version which companies can run on their own servers.Blockchain is a decentralized ledger of data which is spread out across various network locations instead of a central server. That data is secured in encrypted ""blocks"", which can be accessed through a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Blockchain's role in verifying cryptocurrency transactions made it one of the hottest buzzwords in tech over the past year. However, blockchain can also be used to verify traditional financial transactions, streamline logistics, track supply chains, and improve food safety.Back in 2016, Google started a trial which let developers test blockchain services in its cloud. At a recent conference, Google ad chief Sridhar Ramaswamy stated that the company had a ""small team"" working on blockchain, but that its core technology still couldn't handle a lot of transactions. This means that Google could face a tough uphill battle against blockchain leaders IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).Why IBM and Microsoft own the blockchain marketIBM is often considered a slow-growth tech company, but it has a massive enterprise footprint with its business hardware, software, and IT services. In recent years, Big Blue invested heavily in the growth of its ""strategic imperatives"" -- in the cloud, analytics, mobile, security, and social markets -- to offset sluggish demand for its legacy products.One of these strategic imperatives is blockchain. IBM is no match for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) in the public cloud market, but it's still one of the top companies in the private cloud of on-premise servers. It also has a significant presence in the hybrid cloud, which tethers on-premise servers to public cloud services.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.IBM's massive computing power across those private clouds, combined with its long list of enterprise customers across multiple industries, gives it a huge launchpad for new services like blockchain.That's why Juniper Research ranked IBM as the top blockchain company in the world last September, with 40% of surveyed tech executives and leaders ranking Big Blue as their preferred blockchain service provider. IBM recently revealed that it already had 400 active clients on its blockchain platform.IBM's closest rival in the market is Microsoft, which was chosen by 20% of respondents in Juniper's survey. Microsoft has a significant presence across the public, private, and hybrid cloud markets. Microsoft Azure is the second largest public cloud platform in the world after AWS, and the company is generally considered the top private cloud software provider in the world.Most private clouds run on Microsoft's Windows Server OS, and the company tries to bridge the gap with Azure via hybrid cloud services. Like IBM, Microsoft has a long list of locked-in enterprise customers and plenty of computing power. Microsoft is mostly focused on using blockchain to address cybersecurity issues.Can Google catch up?Google recently revealed that its G Suite and Google Cloud Platform businesses were generating $1 billion per quarter. That would give the Google Cloud Platform an annual run rate of just $4 billion.Jefferies analyst Brent Thill estimates that only half of that total comes from the Google Cloud Platform -- which competes against AWS, Azure, and IBM Cloud. That puts Google well behind Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM -- which generated $21.2 billion, $20.4 billion, and $10.3 billion in cloud service revenues, respectively, over the past year.To compete more effectively against IBM and Microsoft, Google needs to expand its enterprise footprint. However, that's proven tough in the past, since IBM and Microsoft have deeply entrenched positions in the enterprise market. Google has gained some ground with small to medium-sized businesses, but it still needs to expand its cloud business a lot more to host a formidable blockchain service.A $60 billion market opportunityHowever, the blockchain market could be big enough for Google to co-exist with IBM and Microsoft without too much direct competition. WinterGreen Research estimates that the market for blockchain products and services could grow from $706 million last year to over $60 billion by 2024. Therefore, it's not too late for Google to board the blockchain train before it leaves the station. "
Will IBM Stock Surge in 2018? 1 Analyst Thinks So,"Jan 3, 2018 at 2:14PM","Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...Is IBM (NYSE:IBM) stock cheap enough to buy?IBM has looked cheap for a long time. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, this titan of the tech world has traded at an average price-to-earnings ratio somewhere in the midteens or lower -- and it's stayed there for more than a decade. The fact that IBM has stayed so cheap for so long has earned IBM something of the reputation of a value trap among investors. Thus, even at a current P/E ratio of 12.6, investors remain leery of investing in IBM.But could 2018 be the year that that all changes? Is this time different?Canadian investment banker RBC Capital thinks so. Hailing the ""return of the machine,"" this morning RBC announced it is upgrading shares of IBM stock to outperform and assigning the $159 stock a price target of $180 a share. Here are three reasons why.MAINFRAME COMPUTERS ARE KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF BIG BLUE, SAYS RBC CAPITAL. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.1. Margins and mainframesAs RBC explains in a note recapped by StreetInsider.com (requires subscription) this morning, there are ""a host of cyclical and secular levers that should enable share performance through 2018."" Chief among these are ""a return to gross margin stability coupled with revenue growth in 2018.""This would come as a welcome relief to IBM investors. As those who've watched this stock for a while will recall, IBM's revenue has been shrinking, not growing for more than half a decade, falling steadily from the $106.9 billion in revenue recorded in 2011 to just $79.9 billion in 2016 (and $78.4 billion over the past 12 months). And yet, according to RBC, z14 mainframe revenue for IBM will hit the peak of its cycle in the December and March quarters (fiscal Q4 2017 and Q1 of 2018).Margins, too, have been suffering. After rising more than 300 basis points from 2011 to 50% in 2014, gross profit margin proceeded to tumble thereafter, reaching a recent low of 46.3% over the past 12 months. On the bottom line, net profits have fallen even longer -- from 17.2% in 2013 to 14.7% over the past year.Improved revenue from better mainframe sales, however, should enable IBM to better use all of its production capacity, and boost profit margins on those sales -- bolstering profits on the bottom line.2. More revenue from ""hybrid IT""A second revenue driver that RBC sees kicking in for IBM this year hails from ""hybrid IT"" -- businesses spending to complement their in-house IT resources with cloud-based services. RBC notes that at least three IBM competitors in this arena -- NetApp, Red Hat, and VMware -- are seeing their revenues benefit from ""underlying demand trends"" in hybrid IT. While RBC isn't going so far as to predict that IBM will outperform these nimbler rivals, the analyst argues that ""given IBM's position as a key enabler for Hybrid IT for large enterprise, the company should at least see revenue growth in-line to modestly below IT spend patterns (~1-3% growth potential).""3. Help from abroadOne final note: For three years now -- approximately the same period of time that IBM's profit margins have been sagging, and accounting for much of the time that its sales growth has stalled -- IBM has suffered from foreign exchange headwinds in the form of a strong U.S. dollar. A strong U.S. dollar may sound like a good thing, but for corporations, it that makes selling U.S.-origin goods and services to foreign buyers harder, because they look more expensive relative to foreign-origin offerings.In 2017, however, exchange rates finally broke in IBM's favor, and dollar-denominated sales now look approximately 10% cheaper than they did for much of this expensive-dollar period. RBC estimates that high exchange rates shaved about 1 full percentage point off of the sales that IBM would have recorded in a more favorable currency environment. In 2018, however, RBC believes a reversal of this dynamic could add about 30 basis points to IBM's revenue growth rate.What it all means to investorsSo let's sum up: Between mainframe cycle sales growth, 2%-ish sales growth from hybrid IT, and about 30 basis point in extra revenue from currency effects, RBC appears to be predicting something on the order of 3% or better growth in sales at IBM this year. That's not a lot, but it would still be an improvement over the five straight years of sales declines that IBM investors have suffered through this past decade.Combined with even a modest improvement in margins, this should suffice to produce the sub-5% growth in earnings that analysts, on average, are looking for IBM to produce over the next five years (according to S&P Global data). Combined with IBM's rich 3.9% dividend yield, this has RBC thinking that IBM stock is a good bet to outperform in 2018.To this I'd add that for three years running, IBM has consistently produced free cash flow superior to what it's reported as net earnings on its income statement. (For example, over the past 12 months, reported earnings of $11.3 billion fall short of the $11.6 billion in real cash profits the company has produced.) This trend has me inclined to agree with RBC that IBM is a good bet to outperform. Before I go all in on the stock, though, and actually endorse IBM as an investment, I'd really like to see management use some of that cash flow to pay down IBM's heavy debt load.With $16.1 billion worth of cash, long-, and short-term investments on its books, you see -- but $41.3 billion in long-term debt -- IBM stock is actually about $25 billion more expensive than its stock appears to be based on market capitalization alone. If and when I see IBM whittle away at that debt, though, and if and when the predicted growth appears, I promise to give IBM another look.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is International Business Machines Corporation a Buy?,"Apr 4, 2018 at 9:17AM","International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has missed out on the market's momentum over the last five years, and not without cause. The company's legacy hardware and software businesses have been in decline, weighing on sales and casting doubt on the company's future. Revenue is down roughly 22% over the last five years, and the weakening of its hardware and services segments has prompted the company to pivot to a range of cloud-focused businesses to move the company in a new direction. With shares trading at roughly 11 times forward earnings and 12 times expected free cash flow, I think IBM is a worthwhile idea for investors. Underappreciated turnaround prospects and a fantastic returned-income profile create the potential for the stock to do big things over time.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM. Returning big value to shareholdersIBM's dividend is one of the most compelling reasons to own the stock. The company offers one of the better payouts in the tech sector, with shares yielding roughly 3.9% at current prices. It's also built a dependable history of dividend growth, raising its payout annually for 23 years and generating enough cash to keep the increases coming. The cost of its dividend represented just 42% of IBM's free cash flow for 2017, suggesting that the company could continue to deliver dividend growth even if its business hits rough patches on its road to reinvention.Big Blue is also conducting an ongoing share repurchase initiative, having reduced its outstanding share count by 16.9% over the last five years. It still has authorization to buy back another $3.8 billion in stock. That should lend additional momentum on the earnings front and free up the company to deliver greater dividend growth down the line.IBM has a great history of returning value to shareholders. Some might argue that it's pursued that priority to a fault and that this caused the company to miss out on big tech trends like mobile. However, it seems like the company is currently striking a good balance between returning income and investing in the future of the business. How's the turnaround progressing?The company's systems segment -- which includes systems hardware and operating systems software -- bounced back in the fourth quarter, with revenue up roughly 30% compared to the prior year due to sales from its Z mainframe line. The mainframe category is cyclical, and it's certainly welcome to have the business on an uptrend, but over the long term, the hardware segment will probably continue to decline. IBM's future is hitched to cloud services, analytics, security, and mobile -- a selection of businesses it groups under the banner of ""strategic imperatives."" 2017 saw this segment grow sales 11% year over year to $36.5 billion, or 46% of overall revenue. Cloud revenue for the period climbed 24% to $17 billion, with the as-a-service component of that rising 18% to $10.3 billion.IBM is showing solid, if not spectacular progress and has the potential to leverage its enterprise credentials to keep growing its private and hybrid cloud services. That's where bets on technologies like blockchain, quantum computing, and its Watson artificial intelligence system will come into play. IBM appears to be making smart investments in areas that will shape cloud security and analytics, and, if it can leverage competitive advantages from them, it stands a good chance of overcoming declines elsewhere in the business.The company is guiding for sales growth in 2018, which would be the company's first year of sales growth since 2013. However, it's also expecting free cash flow to come in roughly $1 billion short of 2017's total due to increased capital expenditures and a $600 million tax hit. That still puts projected FCF for this year at roughly $12 billion -- nothing to sneeze at even if it's below the $14.9 billion in FCF that the company clocked five years ago. Despite the long-term weakening of its systems segment and the costs associated with pivoting to cloud services, IBM is still a high-margin business that produces ample free cash flow. The company anticipates margin improvement as it continues to scale its cloud business. That could be disrupted by competition and other factors, but, for now, IBM appears to be positioned to continue delivering healthy cash flow.An solid income play in techRapid sales and earnings growth and big opportunities in the tech sector have elevated valuations, making value plays in the space harder to find. IBM's comparably sluggish performance in recent years isn't something to celebrate, and the company needs to overcome substantial challenges before it can claim a successful turnaround, but I think the tough stretches have also led to an opportunity for long-term investors.There are signs that Big Blue's reinvention effort is moving in the right direction, and its low earnings multiples and great dividend do a lot to round out a comeback story that's worth having a stake in.

"My Interview With IBM’s Vice President of Blockchain Technologies, Jerry Cuomo -- Part 1","Jan 7, 2018 at 6:15PM","IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.While 2017 may be the year in which bitcoin took the investing world by storm, 2018 may be the year when bitcoin's underlying technology, the blockchain, takes the business world by storm. In fact, IBM (NYSE:IBM) CEO Ginni Rometty said earlier this year that, ""What the internet did for communications, I think blockchain will do for trusted transactions."" Bitcoin was conceived as a peer-to-peer currency with no central authority, in which the underlying blockchain technology was so transparent and un-alterable that no government entity was needed to govern transactions. That transparency and security is what is so attractive -- and perhaps revolutionary -- to industries such as global finance, shipping, and food safety. Of course, large corporations need a trusted party to run their blockchain networks. With its decades of experience in operating technologies for business, IBM is an early mover in this space.I was recently afforded the opportunity to hold an exclusive interview with Jerry Cuomo, IBM's vice president of blockchain technologies, to learn more about IBM's active blockchain networks -- some of which are already very large and mature -- as well as the technology behind them. In Part 1 below, we'll go over some of what Cuomo had to say about the high-level picture of what blockchain is and how it is being used already by a variety of industries. In Part 2, I go over what he had to say about how blockchain works in IBM's cloud, how the technology was conceived in the Hyperledger Project, and the current competitive dynamic implementing this open-source technology. Here are some of the highlights from my conversation with Cuomo. IBM provided the transcript. I edited some of the quotes for clarity.Blockchain for businessI asked Cuomo to describe from a high-level perspective what blockchain technology is, from IBM's perspective. He said:I think there are two sides to the coin of blockchain. One is a social phenomenon, but that's powered by a technological phenomenon. And from a social phenomenon, it's really a new way for businesses to interact. Interact in a way that's more direct, and in such a way where trust is distributed across the businesses, to enable the group to achieve more than any of the individual members could achieve.From that, there's a range of, obviously, more basic cost-saving types of things that a blockchain network could provide to a group of collaborating companies, to a whole new set of business processes. Some that we're conceiving, and some that haven't even been conceived yet. And it's all powered by this distributed ledger technology that is made famous by bitcoin, but not limited to cryptocurrency as a use case.I then asked him about some of the different blockchains, or ""active networks,"" as the company calls them, and how many of them IBM was currently running.An active network is something that is a network that has multiple institutions, actively exchanging digital assets of value. So, it's a very simple definition of multiple institutions actively exchanging things of value through a distributed ledger. From that perspective, we're on track this year [2017] to do over 35 of those active networks.Industry applicationsI asked Cuomo and to describe some of the more prominent active networks IBM is managing.The elder of the group is the Global Finance Network. That's associated with this channel financing network that finances things like parts for computers for institutions assembling or shipping or consuming computer parts. That is about $40 billion per year in capital in that network, and at any given time, there can be up to $100 million in money that is held in dispute. So, you know, I shipped you something. I said I shipped it. You said you haven't received it, but the shipping company said they sent it-- it's not uncommon for that to happen.A year and a half ago, one of the elder statesmen is this network, where now we have over a dozen of the highest-transacting institutions in this supply chain. There's about 4,000 suppliers and consumers in that network. We only have a small portion of them, but the portion that's responsible for the majority of the interactions. And we're seeing disputes now which were taking on average 44 days now being resolved in under 10 days.That's the most active of our networks, and part of it is because it's been out for a while. There's several million blocks on the ledger now, representing the transactions that are part of this dispute resolution process.Cuomo went on to talk about some of the other active networks, what they do, and the companies involved.Others include the food safety network that we recently announced with Wal-Mart, and Dole, and Kroger, and McCormick, and a bunch of others. The network that we are collaborating on with Northern Trust around private equity administration and management -- that actually has a government institution, the Government of Guernsey, is helping regulate that network. So, it's one of the first active networks that has a participant that is a government entity. Cross-border payments, global payments is one of the networks that we're helping to facilitate with a few other players like T.D. Bank, and a few other players there. Healthcare continues to be a very interesting space. Patient records, supply chain around drug authenticity. We're working with a company called Everledger who is working on a luxury good network and things like the Kimberly Act, [which helps prevent ""conflict diamonds"" from entering the market] ... So those applications are key.We had the 35 or so graduating this year [2017]. We look forward to have, you know, maybe 10x that next year [2018].I was astounded at the 10x number, and what it could mean for transforming business and society. But what I learned next showed me how blockchain could also impact everyday citizens in important ways.Preventing Equifax-like scenariosBlockchain has also been mentioned as a way to prevent fraud and hacking, such as we saw in the Equifax data breach of 2017. With cybersecurity and privacy concerns on the rise, I asked Cuomo how blockchain technology can help prevent incidents like these in the future.The one I'm very excited about is around identity and identity verification. You know 2017 is going to be remembered for a lot of amazing things. But one thing that is a bit on the negative side is the Equifax breach.What blockchain could do is provide a digital rights management system for personal information. And we're doing this through a company called SecureKey in Canada who's creating a network called the VerifyMe network. Which, through the VerifyMe mobile application, is creating a way for citizens to get control of their personal information and ""friend"" institutions, like your favorite bank or your favorite motor vehicle department.So when you're renting an apartment, and the rental agency asks you for where you live, how long have you been at that address, do you have a bank account in good active status, you can give that real estate company permission to ask a bank and a government agency for that information once. And conversely, you can give permission to the bank and the government agency to answer the question when it's asked.They call it ""triple-blind."" The agency doesn't know, the bank doesn't know, and the network provider doesn't know. So, triple-blind. All under command and control of the end user, or let's say the rightful owner, of the data. And that's what blockchain could do.While the applications of blockchain are fascinating, investors are likely interested in how IBM built out its active networks, and what it may mean for IBM as a company, as well as its enterprise IT competitors. In Part 2, Cuomo and I delve into the nuts and bolts of how IBM's blockchain works, how it was conceived, and how investors should think about IBM blockchain with respect to industry competition.

4 Ways IBM Watson's Artificial Intelligence Is Changing Healthcare,"Jan 12, 2018 at 6:04AM","Some say that artificial intelligence (AI) will radically change healthcare in the future. And they're right. But that prediction overlooks an important detail: AI is already significantly changing healthcare.IBM (NYSE:IBM) Watson Health general manager Deborah DiSanzo spoke at the annual J. P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Wednesday. She provided an update on the progress that IBM Watson, the AI system famous for beating Jeopardy! game show champions several years ago, is making in improving healthcare. DiSanzo highlighted four areas where AI is making a big difference today.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.1. Managing careDiSanzo noted that 20% of patients typically consume 80% of total healthcare costs. These high-cost, high-need patients require close managing of care. IBM Watson Care Manager was designed to help manage care more effectively.The system assists healthcare teams by sifting through structured and unstructured patient data, as well as the latest evidence-based medicine, quality standards, and regulatory requirements. IBM Watson Care Manager then helps the teams create individualized care plans and recommend the optimal approaches to care. Use of AI in managing care is probably more prevalent than you think. DiSanzo said that roughly 147,000 patients now have their care plans managed with the assistance of IBM Watson Care Manager. She stated that the technology has been particularly useful in behavioral health and social care management.2. Accelerating drug discoveryIt takes biotechs and pharmaceutical companies 10 years, on average, to bring a new drug to market, according to industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. And most experimental drugs never actually make it through to market. DiSanzo said that IBM Watson for Drug Discovery is already helping accelerate the process.IBM Watson Health collaborated with Barrow Neurological Institute, who used IBM Watson's AI to rank 1,500 proteins for their predicted association with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Of the top 10 proteins ranked by IBM Watson, eight of them proved to be linked to ALS. Here's the kicker: Five of them had never before been associated with the disease.How could AI achieve something that humans hadn't done previously? DiSanzo stated that IBM Watson ""makes invisible data visible."" She said that even the smartest medical researchers struggle to keep up with the sheer volume of new information being generated. IBM Watson, on the other hand, was built to churn through the ever-growing amount of research data available. By doing so, the technology holds tremendous potential to bring new drugs to market quicker than ever before.3. Identifying appropriate cancer treatmentsDiSanzo cited a study performed by Manipal Hospitals in India where IBM Watson for Oncology ""agreed"" with the healthcare system's multi-disciplinary tumor board-recommended treatment approach in 93% of 638 breast cancer cases. Is IBM Watson recommending cancer treatment on its own? No, but the real potential is for AI to improve the consistency and overall quality of cancer care more quickly, freeing up physicians to spend more time delivering care to patients.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Use of AI in this way is picking up steam. DiSanzo said that in 2015, only one healthcare organization used IBM Watson for Oncology. The following year, that number rose to eight. Now, though, the technology has been deployed in 155 hospitals and healthcare organizations. She also noted that the number of types of cancer for which IBM Watson is trained has increased significantly over the last year or so.Another study mentioned by DiSanzo was conducted by the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Care Center. This study used IBM Watson for Genomics to analyze tumor-sequencing data. The analysis found that the AI technology was over 99% accurate in identifying the treatment recommended by the human tumor board. Also, IBM Watson found clinically actionable information for one-third of the patients in the study that human physicians didn't identify. 4. Matching patients with clinical trialsOne underappreciated difficulty with drug development is identifying which patients meet the criteria required for different clinical trials. This is an especially daunting task with cancer drugs, considering that there are nearly 1,000 cancer immunotherapies in development, and even more in pre-clinical testing, many of which could advance to human studies.That's where IBM Watson's Clinical Trial Matching (CTM) system comes into play. This system eliminates the need to manually compare clinical trial enrollment criteria with patient medical data. Instead, it uses AI to read through all of this data, matching the right patient to the right clinical study.DiSanzo highlighted some impressive results for the CTM system. Using the AI technology reduced pre-screening wait time by 78% during a 16-week trial period, IBM Watson automatically eliminated 94% of patients who didn't meet clinical trial requirements. This translates to faster enrollment for clinical studies, which ultimately could tie into the goal of accelerating the speed by which new drugs can make it to market.   Key investing takeawaysAll of the advances mentioned by DiSanzo are exciting. But what should investors make of it?IBM's cognitive-solutions segment, which includes IBM Watson Health, currently generates around one-fourth of the company's total revenue. That's a significant amount, but it also means that IBM makes most of its money elsewhere. Buying IBM stock just for its potential to revolutionize healthcare with AI probably isn't a wise choice.However, the technology giant's leadership in applying AI to healthcare certainly is a big plus. There are also other reasons why the stock could be appealing to investors. IBM stock is valued attractively right now, with shares trading at less than 12 times expected earnings. And it pays a nice dividend that yields close to 3.7%.These factors, along with others, led my colleague Tim Green to conclude that IBM is the one tech stock you'll want to own if the market crashes. I think Tim is right. And I fully expect AI to become an increasingly important driver for IBM's growth. The company is already using IBM Watson to change healthcare, and there's a lot more change to come.Editor's note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that IBM Watson partnered with Pfizer on ALS research. While Pfizer does use IBM Watson on immuno-oncology research, the partner for ALS research was  Barrow Neurological Institute. The Fool regrets the error."
"My Interview With IBM’s Vice President of Blockchain Technologies, Jerry Cuomo -- Part 2","Jan 7, 2018 at 6:15PM","I recently had the privilege of speaking with Jerry Cuomo, vice president of blockchain technologies at IBM (NYSE:IBM), for a wide-ranging interview. Our talk left me extremely interested and excited about blockchain technology, as well as its potential to transform not only businesses, but also our daily lives.In Part 1, we discussed what blockchain is at a high level, and the types of active networks in use today on IBM's platform. In Part 2 below, we discuss the nuts and bolts of how IBM's blockchain platform came to be, where and how IBM operates its active networks, and the companies involved in the Hyperledger Project. IBM provided the transcript. I edited some quotes for clarity.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.A new type of blockchainWhile blockchain technology for things like bitcoin are truly open and ""unregulated,"" large corporations obviously have much more stringent protocols in terms of security, privacy, and speed. I asked Cuomo how IBM's expertise in mission-critical business operations helped enable these large ""active networks"" with many leading corporations participating.We actually had to work on a new style of blockchain to support the needs of these companies.This is why in 2015, we collaborated through the Linux Foundation, with initially 20 companies, that's now close to 200 companies, which is the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Project, and donated the first set of code, which now is the Hyperledger fabric, which is a permission blockchain technology that is being worked on now by 30-plus companies, including IBM. This is the foundation for those 35 networks.It is also special in the sense that it has two critical features that businesses that need to follow rules and regulations -- things like HIPPA, or GDPR in Europe. There's two things that we had to do to alter the DNA of blockchain.One is around timely data finality. So that a transaction resolves rather quickly, and definitively. So when you do a get-balance on your account, within a second, you get an answer. And that answer stays the answer until you change your account. You can't fork the network or something like that. So, that was an important, as you can imagine, feature to acquire.The other feature is around accountability. Because of these regulations, while it's important on the network to transact privately, in an audit scenario, you should be able to divulge who is involved in a particular transaction. It's why we call it a permission blockchain. And we build trust using consensus algorithms where, ultimately, we know -- we have a means to know who those members are.It also has another interesting side effect: Because of that, you don't have to go through the additional steps that other blockchains have to do, like mining, and because of the fact that there is no mining, performance is one of the positive side effects.So, we're seeing transaction rates in the thousands -- for several types of transactions -- and we've seen them as high as over 5,000 transactions per second. And that really opens the aperture for the types of applications that you can now apply to these types of networks.IBM Cloud and ""old friend"" ZIBM posted a great third quarter, highlighted by the success of its new Z mainframe and growth in its cloud segment, which is part of the company's strategic imperatives. Given the importance of blockchain technology going forward and the vast amounts of data and computing power needed, I asked Cuomo where these active networks are hosted, and how IBM's technology fits in.We have free on-ramps for developers to get started on the IBM Cloud, and once you get to a more mature state ... we have what we call Enterprise and Enterprise Plus plans to run the network peers in a more secure environment.Lower-end blockchain networks, you can kick up on our cloud. We leverage technology like Kubenetes and Docker ... But on the high end, we actually have ways to deploy with an additional level of security, tamper-resistance, and performance by doing that.We had many ways that we could have done this and implement this within the IBM Cloud, and we decided to bring an old friend back to work here. We put the new mainframe we have, which natively speaks Linux and natively deals with cryptography as a first language, not a second language. So, we brought those technologies to bear. And we've installed mainframes in over half a dozen locations around the world at our cloud data centers, co-located there, to help run some of the higher-end blockchain networks.The Hyperledger ProjectAnother piece of the new blockchain technology that struck me was that it is built upon open-source technology. Some may tend to think of older technology companies as hanging onto a proprietary and closed system, in which the company keeps its technology more secret, which also makes it difficult for customers to switch vendors.  However, more and more legacy IT companies like Microsoft and IBM are adapting, and even thriving, in an open-source world, where technology is shared among competitors. A recent example of this is IBM's partnership with Hortonworks, which runs a Hadoop distribution on open-source Apache software. Similarly, the IBM blockchain technology was built at the Hyperledger Project, which hosts about 10 open-source projects that work toward building out blockchain technology for business.I asked Cuomo about how the project came about, who controls the Hyperledger project, and how it all works.The Hyperledger Project was conceived in the end of 2014, but it came to life, February 2015. The Hyperledger Project works through the Linux Foundation. The Linux Foundation grew up as a governance body to manage the Linux operating system. And what they started doing over the years is diversifying and including other projects beyond the Linux operating system. And they've become a gold standard of sorts to provide an open governance system-as-a-service, if you would. They've become quite good at bringing companies together to manage technology in an open way. In a way that could survive any single company if we were -- if IBM were to disappear off of the face of the earth, the Hyperledger Project would still endure.And part of that is because of how they do governance. There's an executive committee, there is a technical committee, there is a fee to join and there's different levels to join. There's premier level, and there's only so many premier seats. IBM holds a premier seat. There's about 20 other premier members. There's a chairman, Blythe Masters from Digital Asset Holdings, is the chair for the Hyperledger Project. There's elections, and that changes from time to time.There's a set of privileges that you get for being a premier member, but there's also general members and associate members, to kind of have a seat for anyone based on their financial means to join. At some level, the joining gives you rights to steer the project.To co-market the project, the funding is used, from the members, to help create the website, manage the technology -- like, for example, we have very stringent rules when one of the open-source project graduates, whether it graduates from incubator state to active state, or from active state to Version 1 state, each of these ceremonies is not just a ceremony, but it comes with some very rigorous inspection of the code, which is paid for by the [member] dues. So, we have security mavens checking the code out for penetration, for security vulnerability and stuff like that. And we've participated in many projects with the Linux Foundation. When it came time to really engage our blockchain, us and several others like us in the industry chose the Linux Foundation, created the Hyperledger Project, and that's how we're all working.CompetitionI then asked what it is like to both collaborate with your competitors on the technology, and what the advantages are of a ""frenemy""-type of arrangement. As the aforementioned Hortonworks and other open-source software companies have shown, you can be both open and financially successful, so I was curious  to learn about the current state of competition among companies at the Hyperledger Project, and IBM's place in the consortium.We at IBM are dedicated contributors to several of [the Hyperledger Projects], including Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer. Those are available through the Hyperledger community. They're not owned by IBM, they're owned by the Linux Foundation, through very liberal licensing -- through Apache licensing. So, anyone could take them, download them from GitHub and have at it any which way they want.We, at IBM, of course we're not doing this solely for the betterment of the world -- although that's part of it -- we think that by doing that, we also reap the benefit of using the technology. So the IBM blockchain platform puts this open-source technology to work in earnest. So, we take the technology verbatim, bring it into the IBM Cloud, and add additional management capabilities around it to help govern the blockchain networks.So, on Monday morning, we get together and we collaborate, and then, you know, Monday afternoon through Friday, we compete like heck. Oracle and Microsoft also have blockchain as a service -- offerings that leverage the Hyperledger Fabric technology.And it works well. It's worked well for many technologies in the past... having seen this before, like with Java, where multiple vendors were offering Java-based application environments, it's really great for driving record speed-to-maturity, and also giving the user freedom of choice. So, they can start on IBM and for whatever reason the IBM platform lets them down, which it won't, but they can pick up their wares and move their network to Oracle or Microsoft. And that freedom of action actually generates a very healthy market through competition and leapfrogging and all that kind of good stuff that happens. And that's what we see brewing, and we're very excited about what's happening around Hyperledger. So, game on, as we enter.Bitcoin is overhyped: 10 better buys for you nowWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is International Business Machines Corporation a Buy?,"Apr 4, 2018 at 9:17AM","International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has missed out on the market's momentum over the last five years, and not without cause. The company's legacy hardware and software businesses have been in decline, weighing on sales and casting doubt on the company's future. Revenue is down roughly 22% over the last five years, and the weakening of its hardware and services segments has prompted the company to pivot to a range of cloud-focused businesses to move the company in a new direction. With shares trading at roughly 11 times forward earnings and 12 times expected free cash flow, I think IBM is a worthwhile idea for investors. Underappreciated turnaround prospects and a fantastic returned-income profile create the potential for the stock to do big things over time.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM. Returning big value to shareholdersIBM's dividend is one of the most compelling reasons to own the stock. The company offers one of the better payouts in the tech sector, with shares yielding roughly 3.9% at current prices. It's also built a dependable history of dividend growth, raising its payout annually for 23 years and generating enough cash to keep the increases coming. The cost of its dividend represented just 42% of IBM's free cash flow for 2017, suggesting that the company could continue to deliver dividend growth even if its business hits rough patches on its road to reinvention.Big Blue is also conducting an ongoing share repurchase initiative, having reduced its outstanding share count by 16.9% over the last five years. It still has authorization to buy back another $3.8 billion in stock. That should lend additional momentum on the earnings front and free up the company to deliver greater dividend growth down the line.IBM has a great history of returning value to shareholders. Some might argue that it's pursued that priority to a fault and that this caused the company to miss out on big tech trends like mobile. However, it seems like the company is currently striking a good balance between returning income and investing in the future of the business. How's the turnaround progressing?The company's systems segment -- which includes systems hardware and operating systems software -- bounced back in the fourth quarter, with revenue up roughly 30% compared to the prior year due to sales from its Z mainframe line. The mainframe category is cyclical, and it's certainly welcome to have the business on an uptrend, but over the long term, the hardware segment will probably continue to decline. IBM's future is hitched to cloud services, analytics, security, and mobile -- a selection of businesses it groups under the banner of ""strategic imperatives."" 2017 saw this segment grow sales 11% year over year to $36.5 billion, or 46% of overall revenue. Cloud revenue for the period climbed 24% to $17 billion, with the as-a-service component of that rising 18% to $10.3 billion.IBM is showing solid, if not spectacular progress and has the potential to leverage its enterprise credentials to keep growing its private and hybrid cloud services. That's where bets on technologies like blockchain, quantum computing, and its Watson artificial intelligence system will come into play. IBM appears to be making smart investments in areas that will shape cloud security and analytics, and, if it can leverage competitive advantages from them, it stands a good chance of overcoming declines elsewhere in the business.The company is guiding for sales growth in 2018, which would be the company's first year of sales growth since 2013. However, it's also expecting free cash flow to come in roughly $1 billion short of 2017's total due to increased capital expenditures and a $600 million tax hit. That still puts projected FCF for this year at roughly $12 billion -- nothing to sneeze at even if it's below the $14.9 billion in FCF that the company clocked five years ago. Despite the long-term weakening of its systems segment and the costs associated with pivoting to cloud services, IBM is still a high-margin business that produces ample free cash flow. The company anticipates margin improvement as it continues to scale its cloud business. That could be disrupted by competition and other factors, but, for now, IBM appears to be positioned to continue delivering healthy cash flow.An solid income play in techRapid sales and earnings growth and big opportunities in the tech sector have elevated valuations, making value plays in the space harder to find. IBM's comparably sluggish performance in recent years isn't something to celebrate, and the company needs to overcome substantial challenges before it can claim a successful turnaround, but I think the tough stretches have also led to an opportunity for long-term investors.There are signs that Big Blue's reinvention effort is moving in the right direction, and its low earnings multiples and great dividend do a lot to round out a comeback story that's worth having a stake in.

IBM Is Finally Getting Some Wall Street Love,"Jan 5, 2018 at 8:15AM","International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) hasn't seen much in the way of analyst upgrades over the past few years. The majority of analysts covering the stock rate it a hold, according to Yahoo! Finance. That's not too surprising, given that IBM has suffered from more than five years of declining revenue.But IBM's transformation has been making progress, and the company expects to break its revenue decline streak in the fourth quarter. At least one analyst is taking notice. On Wednesday, RBC Capital's Amit Daryanani upgraded shares of IBM to ""outperform,"" boosting his price target to $180. He sees 2018 as ""a year of out-performance."" That's music to longtime investors' ears.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.What drove the upgradeThere are a few factors contributing to Daryanani's upgrade. First, IBM launched its latest mainframe system, the z14, in July of last year. These beastly computers began shipping toward the end of the third quarter, providing a boost to IBM's hardware business. Mainframe sales jumped 62% year over year during the third quarter, and they should see a similar increase during the fourth quarter.Daryanani sees the z14 leading to a revenue tailwind for three to four quarters following the launch. That should help IBM have a strong first half of 2018, before it laps the launch during the third quarter.Another factor for Daryanani is hybrid IT spending. IBM is a leader in hybrid cloud computing, where a customer mixes on-premise private cloud and third-party public cloud in a seamless way. This is opposed to a heavy focus on public cloud by market leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft. IBM's large base of existing customers puts it in prime position to help those customers transition to the cloud with a hybrid strategy.Cloud computing is included in what IBM calls its ""strategic imperatives,"" comprised of the company's key growth businesses. These businesses accounted for 45% of total revenue over the past 12 months, and Daryanani expects them to finally begin to drive gross margin higher this year.On top of these tailwinds, IBM still sports a bargain valuation. The company expects to produce adjusted earnings of at least $13.80 per share in 2017, which puts the price-to-earnings ratio at about 11.5. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 trades for 26 times trailing-12-month earnings. IBM also pays a world-class dividend, yielding about 3.7%.Daryanani summed up his view of IBM: ""IBM represents the best mix of technology businesses in the enterprise segment. We think IBM has cultivated the preeminent technology portfolio.""Not too late to buy the stockAfter five years of declining revenue, it makes sense that IBM sports a beaten-down valuation. But as IBM turns the corner and returns to growth, the market should start giving the company more credit. Combine earnings growth with the potential for multiple expansion, and you have a recipe for outperformance.IBM is not a growth stock, and it probably won't become a growth stock anytime soon. The company's long-term financial model calls for low single-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit pre-tax income growth, and high single-digit earnings-per-share growth. That's certainly enough to justify a higher valuation, but don't expect the frothy valuations of other tech companies to find their way to IBM.But because the valuation is so low, the stock can appreciate at a much faster rate than earnings grow, even if the P/E ratio remains below the level of the broader market. If IBM can hit its targets in 2018 and beyond, double-digit stock gains are not out of the question.It's not too late to bet on IBM. With Wall Street starting to wake up to the IBM story, now is the time to buy the stock.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

IBM Will Inch Closer to Dividend Aristocrat Status This Year,"Jan 26, 2018 at 9:15AM","Within the S&P 500 index, only 50 stocks have achieved Dividend Aristocrat status by increasing their dividend payments annually for at least 25 consecutive years. Owning Dividend Aristocrat stocks doesn't guarantee that you'll be free from dividend cuts, but you can give yourself an edge by sticking with these best-of-breed companies.International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), the century-old tech giant that has evolved from selling mechanical tabulating machines to be a leader in cloud computing and artificial intelligence, has not yet joined the Dividend Aristocrat club. IBM has paid quarterly dividends without fail since 1916, a record few companies can match. But thanks to turmoil in the early 1990s, requiring dramatic changes from an outsider CEO to save the company, the dividend has only been growing for 22 years.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.In April, the month when IBM typically announces its annual dividend boost, the company will in all likelihood take one more step toward Dividend Aristocrat status. But unlike many other stocks that sport impressive dividend growth streaks, IBM trades at a depressed valuation that makes it one of the best dividend stocks around.A long history of dividend growthIBM's dividend was slashed in 1993 amid massive losses, and it remained stagnant for a few years as the company was turned around. By the mid-1990s, with IBM saved from collapse, the dividend began growing once again.Since then, IBM's dividend has grown at an impressive rate. The per-share dividend has increased by 2,300% over the past 22 years, good for an annualized growth rate of 15.5%. If you invested $10,000 in IBM at the beginning of 1996 and reinvested your dividends, you would have enjoyed an 11% annualized return and currently be receiving $3,600 in dividend payments each year. This result is despite shares of IBM slumping over the past five years.IBM DIVIDEND DATA BY YCHARTS.Dividend safetyIBM's current quarterly dividend is $1.50 per share, which works out to $6.00 annually. IBM recently reported its full-year results -- here's what percentage of earnings and free cash flow went toward the dividend in 2017, based on the current payment:Metric2017 Payout RatioNon-GAAP (operating) net income43.5%Free cash flow, excluding financing receivables42.9%DATA SOURCE: IBM.Less than half of IBM's earnings and free cash flow were dedicated to the dividend last year. In 2018, IBM expects its operating earnings to be flat, with free cash flow down a bit. Even with a dividend increase this year, these payout ratios will stay at reasonable levels.It would take a steep decline in earnings for IBM's dividend to be at risk. With the company just starting to grow revenue after a five-year slump, driven by its growth businesses and its latest mainframe system, that looks unlikely.A discounted priceIBM trades for just 12 times its non-GAAP earnings, compared to a price-to-earnings ratio in the 20s for the S&P 500. The stock has dropped 23% since peaking back in 2013. Meanwhile, the dividend has been rising, pushing the yield up to 3.6%.That dividend should keep on rising, albeit at a lower-than-historical rate given the lack of earnings growth this year. The good news is that IBM's growth initiatives, which include cloud computing, artificial intelligence, security, and blockchain, are approaching the point where they can fully offset revenue declines in IBM's legacy businesses. Forty-six percent of IBM's revenue in 2017 came from these ""strategic imperatives,"" and this revenue grew by 11%.These strategic imperative businesses are more profitable than the rest of the business, so earnings growth should pick back up as they grow larger. That will allow IBM to continue to grow its dividend for years to come, reaching Dividend Aristocrat status after a few more annual increases. While investors aren't willing to pay anything more than a beaten-down price for shares of IBM today, I doubt that will remain true for too much longer."
IBM Struggled With the Tax Man in the 4th Quarter,"Jan 18, 2018 at 10:09PM","Enterprise-computing titan IBM (NYSE:IBM) reported fourth-quarter and full-year results on Thursday night. On the upside, revenues increased for the first time in six years and Big Blue has marked a clear path toward more growth in the future. On the downside, a massive tax charge resulted in negative GAAP earnings.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.IBM's fourth-quarter results: The raw numbersMetricQ4 2017Q4 2016Year-Over-Year ChangeRevenue$22.5 billion$21.8 billion3.2%Net income (loss)($1.05 billion)$4.50 billionN/AGAAP earnings (loss) per diluted share($1.14)$4.72N/ADATA SOURCE: IBM.What happened with IBM this quarter?IBM's quarterly revenues increased year over year for the first time since the spring of 2012.Sales under the banner of strategic imperatives increased by 17%, to $11.1 billion, accounting for 49% of the company's total revenues.Among the strategic imperatives, cloud-computing services saw 30% annual growth and delivered $5.5 billion in fourth-quarter sales. Data-analytics orders rose by 9%, mobile solutions experienced 23% year-over-year sales growth, and security revenues more than doubled.The GAAP results in the table above include a one-time tax charge of $5.5 billion. The reported tax rate worked out to 124% of IBM's pre-tax income. This unusual charge was triggered by the tax reform bill that was passed in December, and includes a tax on accumulated foreign profits, along with revamped values of the balance sheet's deferred tax assets and liabilities. In short, IBM's collection of unused tax credits is now worth less than it used to be. Without these special charges, IBM's tax rate would have been 6.1% in the fourth quarter.Full-year revenues fell 1%, to $79.1 billion. Adjusted earnings stopped at $13.80 per share in 2017, in line with guidance targets from the second and third quarters.What management had to sayCEO Ginni Rometty dropped a few red-hot buzzwords into her official commentary on this quarter: ""During 2017, we strengthened our position as the leading enterprise cloud provider and established IBM as the blockchain leader for business,"" she said. ""Looking ahead, we are uniquely positioned to help clients use data and [artificial intelligence] to build smarter businesses.""Looking aheadFor fiscal year 2018, IBM expects to boost its adjusted earnings, with the baseline set at $13.80 per share. A new lineup of Power9 server systems should help stabilize hardware sales, as the surge from last year's new mainframe portfolio trails off. Strategic imperatives will continue to grow while legacy operations keep shrinking; that high-growth category of businesses should deliver well above 50% of IBM's top-line sales this year.Beyond that, the return to positive revenue growth should mark the start of a constructive top-line trend. Big Blue is also expanding its gross margins, thanks to a richer sales mix. Those strategic imperatives are helpful in many ways.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"IBM: For Blockchain, Food Safety Is Just the Beginning","Jan 24, 2018 at 8:11AM","As the calendar has turned to 2018, the mania around bitcoin may in fact be turning into investor interest in commercial blockchain, the technology that enables bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In my recent interview with IBM's VP of Blockchain Technologies, Jerry Cuomo, I learned a great deal about IBM's leadership in blockchain for business, the different business applications IBM's blockchain was currently serving, and the history of the Hyperledger Project.Even more recently, I had the chance to interview Brigid McDermott, VP of food safety at IBM Blockchain. While my previous interview with Jerry Cuomo touched on IBM's company-wide blockchain ambitions, McDermott and I looked at the technology on a more micro level, digging into one of IBM's larger active networks: a food-safety blockchain network led by Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and nine other leading food companies. In addition to the Wal-Mart consortium, IBM also recently announced a new consortium in China with not only Wal-Mart, but also JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Tsinghua University.Here are some of the highlights from our conversation. (Some quotes have been edited for clarity.)BRIGID MCDERMOTT, VP OF FOOD SAFETY, IBM BLOCKCHAIN. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.Can technology really help with food safety?I asked McDermott about the beginning of the food safety initiative and how long ago the Wal-Mart consortium started.We started about a year ago. We were having some conversations with Wal-Mart about food safety, and it became pretty clear to all of us that this was a really good match.The obvious applicability is blockchain, and a trusted system of record to supply chain is a great starting place. But above and beyond food safety, everyone in the industry will tell you, nobody wins when there's a food incident. ... It's not like, you know, my competitor's peanut butter is bad, I'm excited, everyone's going to buy mine. Everybody's like, OK, nobody's buying any peanut butter, they're all eating tuna fish. It's just a bad thing when a food incident happens. There are no winners. And so, the willingness of the industry to collaborate is phenomenal, to solve this problem that has been around for eons.The main way blockchain can help limit food safety incidents, as well as the financial fallout, is by being able to instantly track where the food has been, from the farm, to the processor, to the distributor, and the retailer. In the early days of the Wal-Mart partnership, executives put the technology to the test:In early June, the head of food safety for Wal-Mart walked into the office, took a pack of processed mangoes, put it down on the table, and said: ""Test starts now. Tell me what farm this comes from."" And six days, 18 hours, and 26 minutes later, his team came back and told him what farm it came from. And Wal-Mart is great at this, they're one of the best. A week is a perfectly normal response -- if not great response -- to that kind of question. And when we ran it through our system in a live demo, we were able to do it in two seconds.In addition to saying it came from this farm, or these farms in Brazil, we were also able to say, ""And it went to this cold storage facility on this date, and it went to this distribution center on this date."" If there had been a problem, can we triangulate on where that problem was in two seconds? We're both addressing the -- we're trying to head off any people getting sick, and we're trying to head off the financial impact of pulling perfectly good food off of shelves. ... I live in New York City, and there was a problem with salmonella that came up May 17, 2017. It took until July 26 for them to identify that it was papayas.Network effectsAs you may be putting together, these alliances become much more beneficial as more retailers, suppliers, and distributors all buy into the same network. In my investing-oriented mind, I can imagine that would give the blockchain first-movers in this space a beneficial network effect.Blockchain is about trust between parties. And so, what you need to build is not just the technology, but the ecosystem as well. And so, what we announced in August was, yes, we've proven that the technology works. But what we need to prove is that when you get competitors out there across the ecosystem, they trust that this is a way that their data is being used to benefit them, to benefit consumers, to benefit everybody. But not at their expense.You don't want people on separate solutions. What you're trying to do is create a food ecosystem that allows you to look holistically at where food has been and triangulate -- it's a true big-data problem.U.S. vs. China consortiumsIn August, IBM announced a consortium in the U.S. and Europe with 10 of the biggest players in the space all buying into the IBM food safety active network: Wal-Mart, Dole, Driscoll, Kroger, Golden State Foods, McCormick (NYSE:MKC), Tyson (NYSE:TSN), Unilever (NYSE:UN), Nestle (NASDAQOTH:NSRGY), and McLane.Then just recently in December, IBM announced a new partnership in China with Wal-Mart, JD.com, and Tsinghua University. I asked McDermott about that.In China, what we're actually focused on is around standards. One of the things that we found as we were doing this in the U.S. was the absolute critical nature of basing what we're doing on standards. As we look at the Chinese markets we wanted with Wal-Mart and JD and Tsinghua, to really take leadership and say, as companies are thinking about blockchain and food safety, we really need to be ensuring that the market itself is one based on standards and interoperability. As is always the case with standard-setting, the more, the merrier. From our perspective, we had worked with Wal-Mart and Tsinghua and, you know, JD has real presence in the China market. We want to get it started. So, the four of us were like, let's do it. And, you know, welcoming others who are interested in helping drive standards across the industry.I was also curious as to why IBM would have to start two different consortiums, since it seems the active networks are more helpful as more companies buy into the same system. As is often the case in many industries, China has a slightly different regulatory regime for food safety. What we found is that in every country, there are different regulations and different usages standards. And so, making sure that we understand the differences and that we're all, you know, taking those into account is a big part of the focus. ... So, GS1 -- which I think is an important standard because it's an industry-based one -- is a country-by-country based model.Something like Hyperledger with the Linux foundation is a global model, and so, potentially it can be easier to do globally. But I think you do have to balance the local with the global just because of existing efforts.Beyond foodWhat also became clear is that the more efficient all of these processes become, the more that businesses can refocus on other priorities, such as optimization. If trust is no longer an effort, other efficiencies can be unlocked.When you look at supply chain, right, for decades if not millennia, the three biggest problems to solve have been data visibility, process optimization, and demand management. And, if you look at bringing blockchain in, you say, OK, well, that starts addressing data visibility because I trust that I can share it, and with the permissioning, only the people who should see it, can see it. And that changes the dynamic. Once I have all of the data, not just looking at my own little silo, then I can start thinking about the process differently. I can optimize based on the end-to-end process that I'm participating in, not just the one little step that I'm in.I then asked McDermott what she thought of in terms of blockchain's potential in a bigger-picture sense, maybe outside of food safety, or what its impacts could be long term.Five to ten years from now, you'll see almost every industry impacted by blockchain. And, my view is, I've been doing digital transformation for a long time. And I was a little bit jaded, where you always do financial services first, and then you do other things. And that's because, when you're a digital business, like financial services, it's easy to think about digital transformation. And blockchain has been interesting because the benefits have been so clear across some industries. Where people are like, ""Look, this is the missing puzzle piece that we've been waiting for.""I think you'll start seeing a lot of systems go into production in the next year. Five to ten years, I think it'll be a normal part of any kind of business process transformation."
What to Expect When IBM Reports Earnings,"Jan 18, 2018 at 7:38AM","After 22 consecutive quarters of declining revenue, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is on the cusp of returning to growth. The company will report its fourth-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday, and the launch of its latest mainframe system is expected to make all the difference.IBM expects the seasonally strong fourth quarter to produce between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion more revenue than the third quarter. That works out to year-over-year growth of about 1.3%, right in line with the average analyst estimate. It may not seem like much, but a return to even middling revenue growth will be the strongest sign yet that IBM's turnaround strategy is working.IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.What analysts are expectingAnalysts expect IBM to report fourth-quarter revenue of $22.05 billion on average, up from $21.77 billion in the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings, which IBM calls ""operating earnings,"" are expected to grow to $5.16 per share, up from $5.01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.IBM's full-year guidance for operating earnings is at least $13.80 per share. The company has produced $8.65 per share through the first three quarters of 2017, so it needs at least $5.15 per share in the fourth quarter to hit its target. IBM has beat analyst estimates for earnings for 12 straight quarters, and doing so again will put it above its full-year guidance.A mainframe boostIBM announced its latest mainframe system, the z14, in July, and it started shipping it to customers toward the end of the third quarter. Even with shipping so late in the third quarter, mainframe revenue jumped 62% year over year, driving a 14% increase in hardware revenue.The fourth quarter will enjoy a major increase in mainframe sales as well, if history is any indication. Each new IBM mainframe creates a sales spike as customers upgrade. That spike eventually dissipates, and sales decline once the launch quarter is lapped. The extra few hundred million dollars of mainframe revenue will be the main driver of IBM's fourth-quarter growth, assuming the company doesn't fall short of expectations.Strategic imperativesHelping the cause are IBM's strategic imperatives. These are growth businesses, like cloud computing, analytics, and artificial intelligence, that IBM is betting its future on. Over the trailing-12-month period, strategic imperatives generated 45% of IBM's total revenue and grew by 10%. However, this growth was more than offset by slumping sales in the various legacy businesses that comprise the remaining portion of IBM's revenue.Cloud revenue makes up a significant chunk of that strategic imperatives revenue. Over the past 12 months, IBM's cloud businesses generated about 20% of total revenue, and grew by 25% year over year. The run rate for cloud delivered as a service reached $9.4 billion, also growing by 25%.2018 may be the year that IBM's growth businesses finally surpass its legacy businesses, both in terms of revenue and in terms of being able to fully offset slumping sales. The company generally doesn't provide full-year revenue guidance, but I'd expect management to mention expectations for 2018 revenue if they see it growing.The most important report in yearsIBM absolutely needs to post revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Anything less will be a disaster for the stock. It's been more than five years since IBM has managed to produce growth. The turnaround story becomes less compelling with each passing quarter.IBM named a new CFO earlier this month, promoting James Kavanaugh, previously senior vice president in charge of the company's transformation efforts. Previous CFO Martin Schroeter will become senior vice president, global markets.It will now be up to Kavanaugh to paint a picture of IBM's transformation in the company's quarterly conference calls. A new CFO could mean IBM has reached a new phase in its years-long effort to reinvent itself. 10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Google's Data Centers Now Have IBM Inside,"Mar 22, 2018 at 10:09PM","About two years ago, Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced that it was working on an open server architecture based on International Business Machines' (NYSE:IBM) then-upcoming POWER9 processors. Prior to 2013, IBM's chips were available only as part of an IBM Power system. IBM set out to change that with the OpenPOWER foundation, a consortium of companies working to build an open ecosystem around the POWER architecture. Both IBM and Google are founding members, and Google's commitment to POWER was a significant step forward for the initiative.IBM officially launched its first POWER9 chip late last year. On Monday at the OpenPOWER Summit, Google systems hardware engineer Maire Mahony provided an update on Google's efforts to put POWER chips in its data centers. Mahony confirmed that Google's POWER9-based platform, named Zaius, had been deployed in Google's data centers. The platform is ""Google-strong,"" according to Mahony.AN IBM POWER9 CHIP. IMAGE SOURCE: IBM.A big step forward for IBMIBM's goal is to make POWER a significant player in the high-performance computing and hyperscale data center markets, eating away at Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) dominance. Third parties can now build systems around POWER chips, and even design custom versions. Over 200 foundation members contribute technology to the initiative. That includes tech giants NVIDIA and Micron.Back in 2015, an IBM executive quantified what IBM hoped to achieve. A 10% to 20% share of both the high-performance computing and hyperscale data center markets would be considered a victory. With Google finally using POWER9 chips for production workloads, IBM now has a foothold in hyperscale data centers.Why, and for what, is Google using POWER9 processors? Google found that the performance of its web search algorithm, the heart and soul of the company, scaled well with both the number of cores and the number of threads available to it. IBM's POWER9 processor is a many-core, many-thread beast. Variants of the chip range from 12 to 24 cores, with eight threads per core for the 12-core version and four threads per core for the 24-core version. Intel's chips support only two threads per core via hyperthreading.The bottom line is that IBM's POWER9 chips are ideally suited for workloads that fully take advantage of the large number of threads available. Google's web search is one such workload. They're not well suited for workloads that don't benefit from more threads, which is why the market-share ceiling for POWER isn't all that high.Moving data fastMahony also talked about the importance of bandwidth. It doesn't matter how fast a processor is if it can't move data fast enough. IBM claims that one of its POWER9-based systems can transfer data up to 9.5 times faster than an Intel-based system, using OpenCAPI and NVIDIA NVLink technology. That's important for any kind of big data or artificial intelligence (AI) workload.AI workloads are often accelerated by GPUs or other specialized hardware. Google developed its own accelerator, the Tensor Processing Unit, which it uses in its own data centers for AI tasks. But these accelerators still require a host processor that can move data fast enough. Here's how Mahony explained it:And so, what that means is you've built this beautiful accelerator. You invested all of this effort, time, and resources to make that an amazing hardware platform. But if the host processor can't keep up with that, as my colleague said: ""Did you really have an accelerator? Did you really accelerate the fleet?""Early inningsMahony didn't provide any hard numbers on the scale of the POWER9 rollout in Google's data centers, but she did say that the company has reached the phase where it's ready to scale up the number of applications and the machine count. Google does an awful lot of AI-related computing, so it's not a stretch to assume that this rollout will be a meaningful size.Google's use of POWER9 chips in its data centers represents a big vote of confidence in the technology. It's taken a while, but IBM's efforts to provide an alternative to Intel in the data center are starting to bear fruit.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
