Why Book Value Does Not Matter For Buffett's IBM Investment,Mar.11.13,"Value investors will sometimes look at book value when considering stocks that may be good investments. In his annual letter, Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) always begins with a discussion of Berkshire's book value (for reference, Berkshire currently trades around 1.4x price-to-book value). In one of my previous articles, I also looked at book value to identify five potential stocks that appear cheap because they trade below 1.0x price-to-book. However, book value sometimes is not a good indicator when determining the appropriate value of a stock. Specifically, when companies like IBM engage in consistent stock repurchases over the years, investors should ignore book value because it undervalues the true value of the company.Stock Buybacks and Treasury StockWhen Buffett invested in IBM, he probably did not look at book value because IBM currently trades at 12.9x price-to-book. That is a rich multiple, especially for a value investor like Buffett (P/B multiples of 1-2x or less would typically indicate potential bargains). However, because IBM has consistently engaged in stock buybacks in the past 10 years (totaling over $100 billion), looking at book value will actually undervalue the true value of the company. Let's look at the accounting for stock buybacks to see why that is.When a company uses cash to buy back stock, they will incur a deduction of cash on the asset side and a deduction of shareholder's equity or book value (through treasury stock) on the equity side. Here is a simple illustrative example (remember that the Assets = Liabilities + Equity formula has to balance for each accounting entry).As you can see, the book value gets lowered by the amount of the stock buybacks. However, just because the book value is lowered by the stock buybacks, it does not mean the company's annual net income or annual free cash flow is affected (which is what really should be looked at to determine the appropriate market value of a company). If you look at IBM's 2012A P/E multiple, it's around 14.6x P/E, which is much more reasonable. Also if you adjust book value (by adding back IBM's treasury stock, then you are looking at a 1.7x multiple (again much more reasonable)."
5 Stocks That Should Split Now,"Mar. 6, 2013 11:45 AM ET","The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new high on Tuesday, marking a stunning rally since the bottom nearly four years ago. With the market at new highs, you can imagine that there are a lot of stocks at prices much higher than they were a few years ago. Today, I'm going to focus on five stocks that should split their stock now. Not all of these are at new highs, but there are some reasons why I believe they should split now.International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM):IBM is just a few dollars away from its 52-week and all-time high. That has a lot to do with the Dow's rally, since IBM is the largest weighting in the index. However, it's gotten to the point where IBM's weighting is just too much in my opinion. Remember, the Dow is a price weighted index, so IBM with a share price over $200 has a much higher weighting than a stock at say $70.To show how high the weighting is, let's look at the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA), and its holdings as of Monday. IBM had an 11.15% weighting, meaning it accounts for more than 1/9 of the Dow's move. IBM has a higher weighting than the 3rd and 4th largest components combined, which only accounted for 10.78%. Additionally, the bottom nine components in the index only have a weighting of 10.71%. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a higher market cap than IBM, yet Microsoft only accounts for 1.53% of the Dow.I'm not arguing for IBM to split like 2 for 1 or 3 for 1 and take itself out of the top spot. A 3 for 2 split would work just as well, and would put IBM still around $140. At the same time, the Dow could add a new member, which is the basis for another name on this list. Three of the past four IBM stock splits dating back to 1973 have come in the last week of May, with the other one coming on June 1st. We're approaching that time of the calendar again, so maybe IBM will announce a stock split with its next earnings report in April.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL):This one will generate a lot of buzz, because it seems odd that you would split a stock at $431, but no split was announced when we were near $700. Well, it goes back to the name above. I think that you could easily change up the Dow here. IBM could split, and taking out one of the bottom weights opens up a nice slot for Apple. To do that, Apple would need to split, because it trades for more than twice the price that IBM does."
The Dirty Secret About The 1929 Stock Market Crash,"Apr. 14, 2013 10:11 AM ET","Somewhere along the line growing up, most of us have encountered the story behind ""Black Tuesday"" and ""The Stock Market Crash of 1929."" On October 28th of 1929, the Dow Jones Index dropped 12.82%. The next day, it dropped an additional 11.73%. Here is a small glimpse into the story behind the numbers:On Tuesday, October 29, the flood of sales continued. Historians have called this ""the most devastating day in the history of markets."" A gloomy quiet pervaded the trading floor. The week before, traders ran across the floor in panic, trying to submit their orders before prices dropped further. That day, however, the stock exchange was as dour as a funeral parlor. A reporter from the New York Times described the somber scene: ""Orderly crowds lined up before each post, talking in subdued tones, without any pushing."" In that last week of October 1929, the stock market began a momentous decline that came to be known as ""The Great Crash.""During that time, $30 billion in stock value (about the same amount of money the United States had spent in World War I) evaporated completely along with people's dreams of achieving permanent prosperity.I have no intention to understate the misery caused by this fallout or to suggest that the market crash of 1929 ""just wasn't that bad."" But I would like to add some context to the traditional understanding of this terrible stock market decline so that it may help you make more informed decisions about your own portfolio strategy.Let us take a look at the price performance of four of the most legendary American stocks in the 20th century: AT&T (NYSE:T), General Electric (NYSE:GE), Hershey (NYSE:HSY), and IBM (NYSE:IBM).If you take a narrow look at the stock performance of these four companies through the narrow lens of only 1929, then yes, things were incredibly terrible:1. In September 1929, AT&T traded at $304 per share. By November 1929, AT&T traded at $222 per share.2. In September 1929, General Electric traded at $396 per share. By November 1929, General Electric traded at $201 per share."
"4 Obscure, Undervalued Tech Stocks With Strong Fundamentals","May 9, 2013 2:24 PM ET","Growth comes at a price, but that price doesn't have to be expensive; in fact, the cost of software upgrades is already on the decline. Business Week stated that around 70% of American consumers now are already using the technology that will replace it. Merrill Lynch calls it ""a $160 billion tsunami.""Here are four tech stocks that, while more obscure than some of the tech giants we've written about like IBM (NYSE:IBM), Yahoo (YHOO) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), are setting trends and thus worth investing in.Source: Yahoo FinanceActivision Blizzard Inc.

The company's digital business was a major contributor to its bottom line in 2012, representing 32% of total revenues. It exceeded analysts' expectations due to strong holiday sales of its popular video games. Analysts had expected the company to report earnings of 72 cents a share on $2.44 billion revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters.Earnings Guidance. ATVI disclosed its earnings outlook of 80 cents a share in net income and revenues of $4.2 billion in 2013.

The Crazy Thing About The 2008-2009 Stock Market Crash,"Apr. 27, 2013 9:07 AM ET","With all due respect to the terrible economy of 1973-1974, The Great Recession of 2008-2009 has found its place in history as the second worst economic catastrophe to hit the United States in the past century, trailing only The Great Depression. But when you compare The Great Depression to The Great Recession, you will notice one critical difference between the two: many of the blue-chip stocks during the Great Depression experienced significant declines in business performance, while many investors in high-quality assets during The Great Recession of 2008-2009 saw their businesses continue to fire on all cylinders.During the Great Depression, just about everything got whacked. IBM (NYSE:IBM) saw its earnings fall 40%. Pillsbury saw its earnings fall over 30%. General Motors, despite steady international expansion, saw its earnings fall 28%. The Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) railroad saw its earnings get cut in half. AT&T (NYSE:T) experienced an earnings decline of over 20%. For the few American investors fortunate enough to even have money to invest during The Great Depression, they had to make the very difficult judgment call to determine whether the earnings declines of these companies were temporary or permanent. To put it mildly, that makes investing hard.This is what made The Great Recession of 2008-2009 so strange in comparison. Yes, the stock market declined almost 40%. But look at what happened to investors that owned excellent companies outside the financial or cyclical sectors:1. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) saw its earnings decline by about a nickel from 2008 to 2009, as they fell from $3.64 to $3.58. The worst financial crisis many of us have seen in our lifetimes, and P&G is only making six cents less per share. Oh, and the company actually increased its payout to shareholders by giving them a raise from $1.45 to $1.64 in annual payouts.2. IBM, which got clobbered during The Great Depression, survived much better this time around. From 2008 to 2009, IBM actually grew its earnings from $8.93 to $10.01 and jacked up the dividend from $1.90 to $2.15 per share. The price decline from $130 to $82 was actually a blessing because IBM stuck with its buyback program, making shareholders richer in the process. From the IBM shareholder's perspective, the 2008-2009 was actually a blessing that made them richer in a way they could realize at that very moment: the earnings per share went up over a dollar!"
Intrinsic Value Table For The 10 Biggest Companies,"Jan. 18, 2013 12:31 AM ET","It is always interesting to see how the biggest companies in the world compare. Not only price/value wise, but also how healthy their financial statements are. Therefore I used Google Finance's stock screener to filter out the biggest market cap companies with a 5-year average return on equity of 15% or higher. I included return on equity in the screening process, because that increases our chances of finding some potential buy opportunities.The companies identified by the screener were then analyzed using Value Spreadsheet v2.1, which can calculate intrinsic values using three separate valuation models. In addition, this software assigns a score to the fundamentals of the company. The results of this analysis are listed in the table below.TickerPriceIntrinsic valueFundamentals *AAPL502.681,34485XOM90.206760GOOG711.3279280WMT68.857870MSFT27.254890CVX114.746555IBM193.6528555JNJ72.905460PG69.675340KO37.513570* Score out of a maximum of 100The table may require some further explanation. First off, it is ranked from high to a-bit-lower-but-still-very-high market cap. The intrinsic value column lists the average intrinsic value as calculated by the three valuation models included in Value Spreadsheet v2.1 (DCF, P/E, and ROE valuation models). The fundamentals column lists the score that the software assigned based on an analysis of ROE, debt levels, current ratio, book value growth, net margin stability, and growth perspectives. Now that that is out of the way, let us take a closer look at these ten mega-cap companies.Apple (AAPL)Interesting! It seems like Apple is trading at a steep discount to the intrinsic value estimate of $1,344. It should be noted that each of the three valuation models calculated a relatively similar intrinsic value, which makes this estimate more reliable. Also, its fundamentals seem to be very strong judging from the 85 (out of 100) grade. So why not a perfect 100 score? Well, because Apple's current ratio is slightly below the desired 2, and its expected growth rate for the coming five years is significantly lower than it was in the past five years. This seems only normal, since that 70% growth rate cannot be sustained very long, especially for a company the size of Apple.The reason Apple's shares have declined so much lately is because the company has had some trouble with its new map technology, and is losing some market share to competitors like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). However, everyone already knew that the technology sector is highly competitive, right? The fact is that they are expected to still own around 50% of the tablet market in 2016. In addition, Apple's iOS profit margins are way higher than the margins on Android. This might be an interesting stock to further look into.Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM)Based on the analysis, we could conclude that Exxon Mobil is currently overvalued with a price of $90 and an intrinsic value of $67. However, the ROE valuation model gave a significantly higher value estimate, and was therefore omitted from the average. This makes this intrinsic value estimate less reliable. Book value per share is steadily increasing, but the net margin is fluctuating. This and a decreasing growth rate are causing the average 60 grade for Exxon's fundamentals.Google (GOOG)Google's fundamentals get a solid 80, which indicates that the company is in pristine financial health. Again, a slowing growth rate is preventing it from reaching a perfect 100. Google might still see its stock rise a bit further, but there is not a big enough margin of safety to consider buying.Wal-Mart Stores (WMT)As with Google, Wal-Mart seems reasonably priced at $69. However, its current ratio of 0.83 is alarmingly low. In addition, the company has a debt/equity ratio of 0.8. And although this is a manageable amount of debt, a level of 0.5 or below is ideal. Especially if the current ratio is not that high either. I would be careful with this one.Microsoft (MSFT)We have a winner! Well, at least on the fundamental side. The Value Spreadsheet software gives Microsoft a near-perfect 90. Only the PEG ratio is a bit high, but that's no biggie. Microsoft has a consistently high ROE and profit margin, and its tablets and Windows 8 software might give the company some nice growth prospects. Look into this one some more, because currently it seems to be trading at a nice discount to intrinsic value!Chevron Corporation (CVX)Another oil behemoth. The exact analysis I wrote for Exxon seems to apply for Chevron. Currently overvalued, but the ROE valuation gave a higher value. This skewed valuation is caused by these companies' high return on equity (>20%) relative to their low growth rates (<5%). Fundamentals are reasonable. Again, it are mainly the growth prospects which are causing the not-so-amazing grade of 55.International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)Ah, how I love IBM! This company creates amazing technology and is still the biggest patent holder in the world. Yes, they own more patents than Google, or Apple, or whichever company you could name. How is that for a competitive advantage? However, their balance sheet is not that great. IBM is highly leveraged, judging from its 1.6 debt/equity ratio. This fact alone is enough to deter me from coming near this stock.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)When your are as big as Johnson & Johnson, it becomes more and more difficult to grow due to the law of diminishing returns. I believe this company is as big as it will ever get. This is a solid company, and this is reflected in the relatively high price in relation to its intrinsic value. The score for Johnson & Johnson's fundamentals seems not that high, but a big contributor is the sudden drop in the company's net profit margin (from 21% to 14%). Look into what caused this drop before you consider buying this stock.The Procter & Gamble Company (PG)Dear reader, meet the loser of our list. But is this company really that bad? Short answer: no it isn't. If we look closer at the numbers in the Value Spreadsheet analysis report, we see that 2012 showed a slight dip in profitability. Still, the company posts healthy figures. The debt/equity ratio is exactly 0.5 and the ROE is just below 15% in that year. Nothing too serious I'd say. However, with a price way above its intrinsic value estimate I would not waste too much time contemplating this stock and move on to an other opportunity in the market.The Coca-Cola Company (KO)Coca-Cola, one of Warren Buffett's favorites! He once said that he would decline if someone were to give him a big bag of money with the assignment to beat Coca-Cola at its own game. In Buffett's words: ""It can't be done"". He definitely had a point, although PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) is slowly closing in. Everyone seems to like Coca-Cola's products, and so many also like its shares. Therefore, it is currently fairly priced. The company's current ratio of 1.1 and debt/equity ratio of 0.9 are OK, but not optimal. Other than that, Coca-Cola is an amazing company, and because of that it does not trade at a discount to intrinsic value that often.ConclusionI hope you got some fresh ideas from reading this article. Something that has become very clear from this analysis is the fact that the bigger a company gets, the harder it becomes to grow. I'm going to make this kind of analysis a recurring thing. However, next time the focus will not be on mega-caps, but on a different kind of stocks. Any ideas or suggestions?

Why You Shouldn't Think Of The S&P 500 As A Diversified Basket Of 500 Companies,"Jan. 27, 2013 7:53 PM ET","Today, I wanted to discuss the nuts-and-bolts of the S&P 500 composition. Even though I have always known that the S&P 500 is a free-float capitalization weighted index, it never really hit me until recently what the implications are of composing the S&P 500 along market cap lines. While I always had the idea in the back of my head that a $166 billion company like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) would have more weight than a $2.5 billion company like Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI), it took me a long time to realize exactly what this meant from the perspective of someone considering an investment in something that tracks the S&P 500.For instance, let's look at the top five holdings of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO). They are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Exxon (NYSE:XOM), General Electric (NYSE:GE), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), and IBM (NYSE:IBM). Specifically, let's look at what this means in terms of the allocation of your investment dollars: for every $100 that you invest in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, $3.90 gets invested into Apple, $3.10 gets invested into Exxon, $1.70 gets invested into General Electric, $1.70 gets invested into Chevron, and $1.60 gets invested into IBM. In other words, when you are purchasing a basket of 500 companies, you are really putting 12% of your wealth into just five companies alone.The implication of this statement is that the S&P 500, because it is market-cap weighted, may be much more top-heavy than you realize. At the very least, it turned out to be much more concentrated than I initially realized. For instance, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF owns $5.7 billion worth of Apple stock. Let's compare that to the weighting of, say, the 400th weighted stock in the S&P 500. That would be Cincinnati Financial (NASDAQ:CINF). The S&P 500 ETF only owns $50 million worth of the insurance firm. Think about that -- the S&P 500 index owns over 100x as much Apple stock as it does Cincinnati Financial. And considering that there are 99 other companies in the S&P 500 index fund that are smaller than Cincinnati Financial, that means that an S&P 500 index owns more Apple stock than the bottom 100 companies in the index combined. I have found that knowledge particularly eye-opening: if I invested in an S&P 500 index fund, a one percent drop in Apple stock would have just as much effect on my returns as the bottom one hundred companies combined dropping by one percent."
The 'Safe 8' Dividend Stocks To Hold The Rest Of Your Life,"May 15, 2013 2:31 PM ET","Have you ever heard the phrase ""a picture is worth a thousand words""? Well, I'm going to put that notion to the test and demonstrate why I believe that Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP), Kellogg's (NYSE:K), Kraft (KRFT), Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), Unilever (NYSE:UL), General Mills (NYSE:GIS), and Nestle (OTCPK:NSRGY) are the ideal stocks to make up 20-50% of your common stock portfolio.Take a good look at that picture.If you make these eight stocks the cornerstone of your investment portfolio, you will pretty much own every aisle at the grocery store. The appeal of these eight companies is that you can truly be a ""buy-and-hold"" investor with these kinds of companies because they do not share the attributes that typically cause other blue-chip companies to collapse.(1) First of all, none of these companies need particularly strong management to succeed. Warren Buffett publicly criticized the CEO of Kraft (at the time) Irene Rosenfeld for the value destruction of issuing cheap shares to buy Cadbury while paying high taxes to sell DiGiorno pizza to Nestle. Even though this move may have been unwise when adjusted for tax ramifications and the value destroyed by issuing cheap shares, the consequences have been minimal because the operating margin across the board remained steady at 17-18% and overall profits barely hiccupped.You do not have room for much stupidity with a bank investment. When Ken Lewis, the CEO of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), acquired Countrywide, the entire company flirted with bankruptcy, having to issue billions of dilutive shares and taking other extreme measures to stay afloat. That's the nature of dealing with a business that involves high debt to equity: a principal risk is that bad management can sink your ship quickly. That risk is close to nonexistent in the consumer staple sector because the underlying strength of the business is so strong that it can withstand a lot of abuse and still make money for shareholders."
How Share Repurchases Manipulate Fundamental Ratios,"Feb. 20, 2013 11:08 AM ET","Whenever a public company generates a profit, it is left with an important decision - what to do with the additional cash. Companies have three major options available:Retain earningsIssue a dividendShare repurchasesMany companies participate in a combination of the three. The first option allows the company to re-invest back into the business, whereas option 2 and 3 allow for some of the money to be returned back to shareholders. Returning capital to shareholders offers an efficient way to increase value for shareholders; however, share repurchases, in particular, come with consequences, which may end up deceiving unaware investors.Share repurchases, or share buybacks, allow for a company to buy back its own shares in the open market. Companies have different motives for initiating share repurchases, some self-serving (ie. protection from unfriendly takeovers), others, with shareholders interests in mind - ensuring stock options don't dilute shareholder value. Regardless of the reason, they ultimately increase the value of each share, by reducing the total number of shares outstanding. On the surface this seems entirely beneficial to shareholders; however, share repurchases have another underlying deceptive effect. When a company buys back shares, many popular fundamental ratios are affected, even though the underlying fundamentals remain unchanged. By distorting these ratios, year-to-year comparisons become a lot less meaningful.The table below shows the EPS and P/E ratio for Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE:CCE), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Exxon (NYSE:XOM), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Motorola (NYSE:MSI), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) & Wynn (NASDAQ:WYNN):All of the companies listed above participated in a share repurchasing program during 2012, reducing outstanding shares anywhere from 5 percent to 17 percent:"
Cognizant - Why This Technology Multi-Bagger Is Being Ignored,Jan.25.13,"IntroductionCognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) has been a star technology company, giving superb growth and returns over the last decade. Let me start by asking you which has been the best performing technology company in the past 10 years - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Cognizant or Priceline (PCLN)? I would expect that most of you would not come up with the right answer. The right answer is Cognizant, which has given an eye-popping 18596% return over the last decade, beating all of the above mentioned companies by a very wide margin. The reason you might have got the answer wrong is that the media and the investor community have been largely ignoring this stock, despite spectacular revenue and earnings growth. Cognizant has continued to outperform its larger Indian and U.S. competitors and has become the new ""Infosys"" of the computer services space. While Infosys is facing a revenue growth slowdown, Cognizant has continued to beat market expectations. We think that investors should look to buy dips, as the company has proven itself both during up and down cycles.Cognizant - Lot of Things to LikeExponential Revenue and Earnings Growth - Cognizant has kept on growing revenue relentlessly in the last decade. The company has grown its revenue to ~$7.5 billion in 2012, from $229 million in 2003. The growth has been consistently strong and the 2009 crisis did nothing to slow down the high double-digit growth.Margins Stable despite High growth - CTSH has managed to keep its margin relatively stable, despite going against bigger and more reputed companies in the computer services space. The Operating Margin has been in the 18%-20% range, while the Net Margin has ranged between 14%-17%.Zero Debt - The company has accumulated $2.6 billion in cash and has no debt. In fact the company has no debt on its balance sheet for the last four years. The company is adding almost $600-$700 million in cash every year, making the balance sheet grow stronger and stronger. Almost 12% of the company's market capitalization is now accounted by cash.Stock Buyback expansion, Dividends could be a catalyst - The company has increased its earlier $600 million buyback program to $1 billion, as it looks to return the cash to shareholders. We think a dividend would help push the stock higher.Great Management - It would not be wrong to say that Cognizant has one of the best management teams amongst the top Indian software service companies. While Wipro (NYSE:WIT) and Infosys (NASDAQ:INFY) have seen substantial churn in their top management due to growth concerns, Cognizant has an excellent top management, which has been leading the company for a long time.Client Focus has helped Cognizant outperform - CTSH has differentiated itself from other Indian technology companies through deeper engagement with its clients. Its sales and marketing spend has been higher than its peers, as it has spent more money in forming deeper relationships with its clients. The company hires more MBAs in India than any other technology company. This has given the company an edge in business relationships compared with the technology focus of its peers.Bigger Scale will let it dig for even Bigger Deals - As Cognizant has grown to become one of the biggest pure play services players, the company can compete with IBM , Accenture (CAN) and other big players for multi-million IT outsourcing contracts. Around $50 billion in service deals are expected to come up for renewal in 2013. I expect CTSH will win a bigger market share post 2013."
Dividend Yield As An Indicator Of A Bargain,"Apr. 29, 2013 3:40 PM ET","We all want to pick up a good company at a lower price so we can start off with a higher yield. But, how high must the yield go to indicate the possibility of a bargain?Step 1: On Seeking Alpha, create a portfolio of stocks you're following. If the current yield is significantly higher than the 5-year average yield, there might be an opportunity. If the prices of the stocks of a general sector have been compressed so that their current yields are significantly higher than the 5-year average yield, then that might mean there isn't a company-specific issue. In that case, you just need to determine which is the best to buy.Step 2: Go to ycharts.com. Look at the dividend yield graph of the relevant company. Look at the tops and compare it with the current yield.If you're at a top, you may have found a bargain. But don't be hasty, make sure to do a fundamental analysis on the company, such as checking its valuation, earnings, debt levels, and dividend growth history. Here is an example of doing a quick fundamental analysis on Ross Stores. This check of comparing a company's dividend yield with historical yields is just one quick way to sift through your watchlist of dividend growth companies.I actually divide my watchlists into their respective categories, such as Aerospace & Defense. This allows me to easily scan and compare their dividend yields with their 5-year average dividend yields to determine whether the difference is big enough or not. For instance, I have an Aerospace & Defense watch list including Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) as follows:Seen above, the current yields for these companies are higher than their 5-year average. So, we continue onto Step 2. For instance, for Raytheon, I see that in the past 5 years, there have been multiple times that its yield got almost to 4%, so a long-term investor might try to grab some Raytheon shares closer to the 4% yield if he or she decided he or she wanted to own part of that company."
Semiconductor Equipment Companies That Are Hot Or Lukewarm,"May 23, 2013 10:41 AM ET","ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) continues to impress me, but the uncertainty in a changeover in company management can result in some lost momentum. CEO Eric Meurice, who over nine years solidified the company's position as the dominant supplier of machines for manufacturing computer chips, is to step down on July 1 and become Chairman of the Board. Peter Wennink, CFO of the company, will succeed Meurice.ASML clearly dominates the semiconductor lithography market, as shown in the chart below. Under CEO Meurice, ASML moved the company from second place position in 2003 to first place in 2004 and the company never looked back.More importantly, ASML dominates the lucrative, high-end 193nm deep UV (DUV) wet market, as shown below, with an 83.1% share in 2012.Source: The Information NetworkThat was history.

Upcoming production of semiconductors at 7-nanometer and 14-nanometer feature sizes will usher in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography around 2015: ASML expects to sell about 30 tools in 2015 and up to 60 tools in 2016 going to Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) , Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Hynix, IBM (NYSE:IBM) and TSMC (TSMC). These tools cost $85 million.However, when EUV will enter mass production is still up in the air. Intel plans to begin ramping up its 14nm finFET process by the fourth quarter of 2013, and companies may not use EUV, if at all, until they start semiconductor production at 7nm dimensions: Intel invested $4.1 billion in ASML as part of an effort to raise the overall confidence level in EUV and the 450mm wafer transition. TSMC and Samsung also recently invested in the Dutch-based lithography giant for similar reasons. IBM confirmed earlier this year that EUV lithography will likely miss the 10nm node and the industry is looking at inserting EUV at 7nm."
Why Apple Is Still A Buy Despite Its New Industry Classification,Feb. 8.13,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), interestingly enough, suffers from a couple problems, none of which are all that bad to have. One is its new industry classification. Its $400 billion plus market cap puts it into a unique category; a 'new' industry that includes mega-cap stocks. Something strange happens when stocks hit a market-cap above say $200 billion; they stop trading in line with their industry and generally trade at depressed multiples.The other fundamental issue for Apple is its cash. A problem that a number of companies would love to have. It's such a problem that billionaire investor and hedge fund manager David Einhorn is suing the company in hopes of forcing the company to put its cash to work for shareholders. Einhorn explains Apple's inability to spend its cash as a mental issue…It has sort of a mentality of a depression. In other words, people who have gone through traumas ... and Apple has gone through a couple of traumas in its history, they sometimes feel like they can never have enough cash.It can be argued that the depreciation in the stock has resulted in part from the lack of capital returned to Apple's shareholders. Apple has over $136 billion in cash and available-for-sale securities on its balance sheet. It needs to find ways to effectively use those assets. Returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends or stock buy-backs is a good start. In lieu of dividends and stock buy-backs, Apple can also implement an aggressive acquisition strategy with all its cash. Apple can acquire technology and talent to make its competitive advantages durable in its ultra-competitive industry. Either way, shareholders need to see some tangible effects of an increasing horde of cash.Interestingly, Steve Jobs, before his passing, consulted with Warren Buffett on what to do with all of Apple's cash. Warren Buffet's reasons for investing in IBM (NYSE:IBM) can be good reasons for Apple to implement a more liberal dividend and share buyback plan. Although IBM has only grown its revenues a little over 2% per year on average for the last 10 years, its earnings per share (NYSEARCA:EPS) has grown close to 12% per year over the same time frame. The reason for the disparity is the effectiveness of IBM's financial engineering - stock buy-backs and dividends. IBM rewards its shareholders handsomely, so the shareholders stick with the company. When the stock declines, the buy-back policy effectively buys more shares and causes a larger upside for long-term shareholders when the stock normalizes. In the case of Apple, if many investors agreed that its stock was undervalued at $700, they will surely agree that it is undervalued at $500. Therefore, a buy-back program could be more advantageous than ever at this point with the drop in price of Apple's stock."
This Company Has An Underrated Stock Buyback Program,May.28.13,"One difficulty of investing in blue-chip stocks is trying to find dividend companies that are simultaneously executing an underrated stock buyback program. Using the S&P 500 as a reference, most companies fall between two extremes of buyback efficiency.On one hand, you have the bulk of companies that run mediocre buyback programs that do not even manage to mop up executive compensation or other forms of share dilution. As Barron's pointed out, this is probably the worst statistic on the general effectiveness of stock buyback programs I have ever heard: last quarter, 219 of the 317 companies in the S&P 500 engaged in a stock buyback program that failed to reduce the share count. This partially explains why many retail investors prefer dividends to stock buybacks-using our recent sample size, 69% of companies that engage in stock buybacks actually fail to reduce share count in practice.At the other end of the spectrum, we have companies that are notorious for buying back shares. Most blue-chip investors know that ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is retiring about 6% or so of its outstanding share count each year, effectively reducing the size of the oil giant by 1.25% every ninety days (subject to the actual price of the stock at the time of the buyback). Likewise, we know that an extensive stock buyback commitment will play a meaningful role in IBM's (NYSE:IBM) efforts to reach $20 per share in earnings by the end of 2015.Today, I'd like to highlight the stock buyback program run by the ""Rodney Dangerfield"" of carbonated beverages: Dr. Pepper (NYSE:DPS). A lot of times, it is difficult to get the conversation started with Dr. Pepper as a potential investment simply because it is not Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP). Nevertheless, I wanted to highlight how Dr. Pepper has been methodically reducing its share count since beginning a buyback program in 2009, one year after becoming a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange (May 7, 2008).At the present time, Dr. Pepper is buying back roughly 8-10 million shares of stock each year, subject to the prevailing stock price."
Anchor Stocks For An Income Portfolio,"Jan. 16, 2013 11:46 AM ET","In every income portfolio you as an investor must identify and invest in anchor stocks. These are stocks, that no matter what the cyclical economy does, you will not sell. These are stocks, that when there stock prices falls, you look to buy more. Every income portfolio needs anchor stocks. In a previous article of mine I outlined five simple questions to ask about a stock to determine its worth. These are simple questions for those who do not know where to begin. There are many more factors that you should consider before investing in any stock.Does the company pay a dividend?Has it shown a history for increasing its dividend over time?Does the company have a reasonable P/E(18 or less) value?Is the current dividend yield larger than 2 percent?Does the company have a history of buying back stock?Note: The answer to Question 1 must always be a yes. If the answer is no, do not bother asking the remaining questions.We will now look at five stocks that we have identified as anchor stocks contained in our income portfolio.IBM (NYSE:IBM)IBM by its own definition is an information technology company, which provides integrated solutions that leverage information technology and knowledge of business processes. IBM provides a very integrated suite of services and products. This makes IBM exactly the type of IT company that will thrive in the next generation of technology offerings. Let's look at IBM based upon the above criteria1) Does the company pay a dividend?IBM currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.85.2) Has it shown a history for increasing its dividend over time?IBM has increased its dividend payment from $0.40 in 2008 to its current rate of $0.85. CVX also boasts an impressive 17.18% annual dividend growth rate over the last five years. If this average is maintained that would put the dividend pay over the $1.50 mark within the next five years. IBM has also increased its dividend payouts for 17 consecutive years.3) Does the company have a reasonable P/E value?"
What Is An Ecosystem And Why Does It Matter To Smartphone Makers?,"Mar. 20, 2013 11:27 AM ET","I'd like to offer everyone a thesis here as the pundits continue to debate the future of the global wireless communications market - the concept of ""resistance to change"" also known as ""switching cost"" and its supporting element - the ""ecosystem"". So what is a switching cost - well, a quick jump over to the world's favorite search engine will tell you that it represents the negative impact/cost that someone faces as a result of changing from one supplier to another for a service or a product. Switching costs can be monetary - like the termination fee associated with changing your wireless carrier - psychological, effort-based and time-based as examples.In the world of Enterprise Software from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), SAP (NYSE:SAP) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), the players go to great lengths to create their own equivalent of switching cost - known as ""Vendor Lock-in"". This has led to lawsuits at times when the ""lock-in"" has been considered too extensive and proprietary, leading to some famous Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) lawsuits in the past. Nonetheless, the holy grail of any service or product provider is to create this sort of a moat around itself in order to establish challenging barriers to entry and to maintain the strength of its market position as long as possible.So, how does this matter in the mobile marketplace today? Without question, from Google to Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) to Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Microsoft, Blackberry (BBRY) to Apple - every single major player in this marketplace is in a race to establish as much lock-in as possible.But, how do you go about establishing lock-in - can't I just change phones whenever I want, switch carriers whenever I want, and use all my music, apps and everything else however and whenever I want?Well - let's go back to the definition and of switching cost and see what we come up with - the elements we were offered were money, psychology, effort and time.Money:Google: You get to spend money on apps, music, movies, books, magazines and TV."
Meg Whitman Owns HP Now,Apr. 5.13,"If you buy the company known as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) today, you're getting yourself a Whitman sampler.Meg Whitman may or may not be a great turnaround CEO, but she's a great corporate infighter, and now the Queen of all she surveys. That much was made clear yesterday as Ray Lane, the former Oracle president who had been chairman of her board, resigned from that position.The reason given was shareholders' anger over the acquisition of Autonomy by then-CEO Leo Apotheker. That decision was approved by the HP board. Meg Whitman was on that HP board.But somehow she skates from that decision, as she has managed to deflect blame for the company's troubles on others throughout her tenure as CEO.Since Whitman became CEO in September 2011, HP stock has gone both up and down. But it's actually little changed from where it was when she started. The company has not grown at all, and gone through almost $15 billion in losses, many of them blamed on past acquisitions. The last quarter, ending in January, saw 4% of revenue flow through to the bottom line.Whitman has no new exciting products on offer, just a statement of intent regarding cloud computing that could have been written by a telecom company, and which matches those companies' strategies. The PC niche continues to circle the drain, there is no HP phone, the HP tablets are not competitive, printers are dying.But she promises great things to come in two or three years.What Whitman has succeeded in doing is stopping the rot. The company is no worse off now than it was a year and a half ago. The only shareholder gain I can see, assuming you're happy with a 2.37% dividend that the last quarter's earnings could barely pay, would be a sale to a larger, more stable operator. IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) could both afford to make a run at HP right now.So, for that matter, could Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which is worth more than five times what HP is, be interested? That would be interesting.Of course, Microsoft is just as lacking in vision as HP is. But at least HP shareholders would have a better currency to throw around, and they'd be rid of Whitman. By buying HP, Microsoft would more than double its sales, it would gain control of what's left of its ecosystem, and it might get a second look from the market."

"Opko Health: Billionaires, Quantum Physics And The Flux Capacitor",Jan.24.13,"Spotting a new technology that has the potential to revolutionize an industry is a difficult task. In 1984 when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) released its first Macintosh computer, most people did not take note or have the foresight to speculate where the company could take its novel technology in years to come. In 2011, however, when Claros Diagnostics introduced its first desktop diagnostics analyzer that delivers up to 20 disease diagnoses within minutes from a drop of blood, many seemed to take note. The company was profiled among Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others as being one of the 50 most innovative companies in the world for 2011 by the MIT Technology Review. The general sentiment was that this company's product could potentially revolutionize the entire medical industry.Another company working in the same area of next generation medical diagnostics happened to take note of this new technology platform as well, and this company was Opko Health (NYSEMKT:OPK). In the second half of 2011 OPK decided to snatch up Claros Diagnostics for $49,000,000. The match appears to be a perfect fit for the both of them. Brought to the table by OPK is proprietary biomarkers and next generation tests for Cancer, Alzheimer's, Vitamin D, testosterone and various other medical areas. Claros in turn brought to the table a revolutionary technology platform that is capable of transforming the entire diagnostics industry. Its technology appears not to have shown any disease limitations for applicability thus far, but more testing will be needed.In Opko Health's most recent presentation at the Annual JP Morgan Biotech conference they displayed some information that many investors appeared to not have been aware of thus far. The presentation discussed that their new diagnostic technology is in fact not only capable of diagnosing through blood samples, but can also use samples of urine, saliva, sweat, tears, semen, amniotic fluid, spinal fluid and serum. I considered this valuable info since OPK also discussed its diagnostic system testing various other areas such as STDs, fertility, cardiology and more. Further interesting news that OPK disclosed is that they are projecting to launch their 4Kscore™ LDT for prostate cancer by Q2 2013 in the US."
Buffett Calls Upon Phil Fisher To Explain Sound Dividend Policies,"Mar. 6, 2013 11:31 AM ET","Along with many Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) shareholders as well as non-Berkshire (BRK.A) shareholders that appreciate intelligent investment commentary, I spent a couple hours this weekend pouring over Warren Buffett's 2012 Letter to Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. In particular, I read with great interest Mr. Buffett's articulation of what constitutes a sound dividend policy.On page 21 of the shareholder letter, Buffett called upon a witty analogy courtesy of the late Stanford professor Phil Fisher to describe a desirable dividend policy:""Above all, dividend policy should always be clear, consistent and rational. A capricious policy will confuse owners and drive away would-be investors. Phil Fisher put it wonderfully 54 years ago in Chapter 7 of his Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, a book that ranks behind only The Intelligent Investor and the 1940 edition of Security Analysis in the all-time-best list for the serious investor. Phil explained that you can successfully run a restaurant that serves hamburgers or, alternatively, one that features Chinese food. But you can't switch capriciously between the two and retain the fans of either.Most companies pay consistent dividends, generally trying to increase them annually and cutting them very reluctantly. Our ""Big Four"" [note: when Buffett says 'Big Four', he is referring to American Express (NYSE:AXP), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC)] portfolio companies follow this sensible and understandable approach and, in certain cases, also repurchase shares quite aggressively.We applaud their actions and hope they continue on their present paths. We like increased dividends, and we love repurchases at appropriate prices.""What I found most noteworthy about Buffett's commentary on this subject is that he chose to focus much more on behavioral economics at the expense of focusing exclusively on total returns. As you can see in the above quote, Buffett lambasts ""capricious"" dividend policies because they ""confuse owners and drive away would-be investors."" It's entirely possible that a ""capricious"" policy-paying out dividends when the company has excess cash relative to growth prospects (or buybacks at the prevailing market price) could lead to maximum total returns, but Buffett criticizes this approach because it would not work in real life -- an unreliably, herky-jerky dividend policy would jolt most investors to the point of revolt."
AT&T: Trading Below Its Intrinsic Value,May.23.13,"Fundamentally SpeakingAT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) is one of the most honored companies in the world. Recently, PCWorld/TechHive ranked the company's 4G LTE network as the fastest for a second consecutive year. AT&T has always been a solid name to consider for dividends with relatively low risk.Dividend stocks have always outperformed non-dividend stocks over the long term. This is the case whether it is a bull or bear market. The encouraging sign for AT&T is that it appears to be a better investment as a dividend stock than even IBM (NYSE:IBM) and we all know how much I love IBM.Source: The Motley FoolThere is a lot more to love about AT&T. AT&T's P/E ratio may be on the high side at 28.78, but it appears to be healthy considering that its closest competitors have astronomically high or no P/E values reported. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) has a P/E of 129.50 and Sprint Nextel Corporation (NYSE:S) has an unreported P/E.Additionally, AT&T leads the way even with its EPS and it has the largest market cap of the three telecommunications firms with a value of $199.5B.Present Value of FCFFValuing AT&T using the present value of free cash flows (FCFF) makes a very big case to buy the stock right now. The Present value of FCFF is an easy to use tool for investors to quickly assess a stock as it is great at finding intrinsic stock value estimates.The Present Value of FCFF is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation technique. The idea is that if the value obtained from this method is higher than what the shares are currently trading at, then the stock is undervalued.Free cash flows are basically cash flows minus direct costs and payments made to capital suppliers.Intrinsic Stock Value"
Adams Express: A Long-Term Quality Holding,Mar. 6.13,"Adams Express Company is a closed end investment company that is more than 75 years old, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ADX. I have WRITTEN before about ADX and recently WROTE about its sister fund, Petroleum and Resources (NYSE:PEO).ADX buys and holds quality large-cap stocks and maintains a very stable portfolio, with minimal trading. It presently sells at over a 13% discount from net asset value, which only makes it more appealing. You could use ADX to replace the large-cap section of your portfolio.It should be noted that Erik K. Bergstrom, who has no affiliation with the fund, has owned 9.2% of the outstanding shares. ADX owns in excess of 8% of the shares of its sister fund, Petroleum and Resources .As of December 31, 2013, its 10 largest holdings constituted 23.3% of its total portfolio. These holdings are as follows:Petroleum & Resources 4.5%Apple 4.3JP Morgan Chase 2.3QUALCOMM 2.2Lowe's 1.8IBM 1.7Wells Fargo 1.7Microsoft 1.6AT & T 1.6Google 1.6As of December 31, 2012, ADX had assets of $1,155,997,037. with leverage of 0.3% and almost no short-term assets. ADX is involved in an option writing and selling program which constitutes about 1.5% of assets. ADX had a cost basis in its common stock holdings of $1,010,947,838 which had a market value of $1,153,761,081. ADX has a broadly diversified portfolio.The 5 year ratios show a fund with decent performance, a very low expense ratio, decent income and moderate turnover.

"In A Post Flash-Crash World, No One Should Use Trailing Stops","May 20, 2013 12:33 PM ET","Some of you may remember the flash crash of 2010, when the prices of certain stocks fell precipitously in a matter of minutes. To refresh your memory, check out the experience of Mike McCarthy:Meet Mike McCarthy, the man who got flash crashed.In a tragic twist of fate, McCarthy's broker happened to hit the button on a market order to sell his 738 shares of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) at roughly 2:46 p.m. on May 6, 2010. That order was filled at $39.37, not only the lowest price in roughly seven years, but also a dramatic difference from the $60-to-$63 [range] P&G had traded at only moments before and after McCarthy's trade.I feel terrible for McCarthy. He called up his broker, saw Procter & Gamble trading in the low $60s, and then tried to sell his shares. He ended up taking a $15,000 hit on a transaction that netted him $29,000 instead of around $44,000. Although McCarthy's terrible experience happened within the context of issuing a market order for Procter & Gamble, it touches on a broader principle I'd like to discuss: the act of selling a stock merely because the price went down.If you read the full story of McCarthy's narrative, you will know that he became ""skittish"" by movements in the market, and got worried that the ""big boys"" were going to drive the stock prices lower. I hope you do not think like that. And I do not say this to pick on McCarthy - he had a dose of bad luck that he did not deserve. No one should look at a stock quote, see the company selling in the low $60s, and then find out that he sold it for under $40 per share shortly thereafter.But I do want to discourage you from thinking that stock prices represent some kind of absolute truth. The stock market is just a giant auction house for businesses. A stock price does not tell you what the intrinsic value of the company is, but rather, it only tells you what other investors are willing to pay for an ownership stake in the business at a particular time.Some investors automatically sell if their stock falls 10%. Others automatically sell if their stock falls by a certain amount greater than the S&P 500. The reason I do not take this approach to investing is because I would effectively be outsourcing my power to make informed decisions to others. And if I cannot trust my own judgments, what the heck am I doing owning individual stocks in the first place? If you sell your stock simply because its price went down, you are effectively saying, ""Others know something I don't."" I didn't get into investing so that I could outsource to others the power to determine value."
"Analysis Of Oracle's Asset Utilization, Liquidity And Solvency",May.17.13,"Shares of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) are trading well off of its March high following the fiscal third quarter earnings report; the report disappointed investors. Oracle's sales growth slowed primarily because of a decline in hardware sales. Hardware sales at IBM (NYSE:IBM) also declined. Oracle's share price rose in recent weeks as investors accumulated shares following the decline.Given the decline in the share price, what should investors do with shares of Oracle? Should investors put new money to work long shares of the technology giant? To answer those questions, analysis of Oracle's asset utilization, liquidity, and solvency will be reported. At the end is a conclusion.Investors should maintain a safe exposure to the share price of Oracle.Oracle: Activity AnalysisAsset utilization ratios measure how well a company manages various activities, particularly how efficiently it manages various assets. These ratios reflect the efficient management of both working capital and longer term assets: Receivables turnover, days of sales outstanding, working capital turnover, and total assets turnover.Receivables turnover and days of sales outstanding measure how quickly the company collects cash from customers to whom it offers credit. In this instance, Oracle's accounts receivables turnover ratio increased substantially from the end of fiscal 2012 to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2013. That could indicate highly efficient credit and collection, or it could indicate sales being lost to competitors. In this case, I think it indicates sales being lost to competitors: Accounts receivable declined substantially during the first three quarter of the year and sales growth slowed. When Oracle releases its fourth quarter earnings, I will be checking the accounts receivables number to see if it continued to trend lower."
A Look At Exxon's Dividends And Buyback Program,May. 8.13,"The ""tortoise and the hare"" seems to be the story for a lot of successful dividend growth stocks over the long term, but it is especially true in Exxon's (NYSE:XOM) case. The stock's price usually lumbers around in the $80s, and even with the recent 10.5% dividend hike, the starting dividend yield is still only 2.76%. This is why the company is so easy to ignore: the initial dividend yield is unimpressive, and the stock price movements usually do not meet anyone's definition of ""big mover.""But once you become a shareholder of Exxon, take a look at what you get your hands on:A company that is earning a return on capital employed of 25%, which Exxon points out is higher than its peer group of Conoco (NYSE:COP), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), BP, Total (NYSE:TOT), and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.B).A company that is buying back roughly $5 billion worth of stock each quarter. Right now, Exxon is worth slightly over $400 billion. This means that, every three months, Exxon is buying back 1.25% of total shares outstanding. Exxon is in a constant duel with IBM for the largest buyback program in the nation, in terms of total dollars spent (although Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced buyback should turn this into a three-way race).This exhaustive buyback has a very real effect on creating shareholder wealth: in 1999, Exxon had 6.9 billion shares outstanding. Today, the total is down to 4.5 billion shares (the true results of the buyback program are even more impressive than that, considering that Exxon had to issue shares in 2010 to cover the XTO acquisition).In 2012, Exxon made $37.3 billion in net profits. If the company had to spread those profits across 6.9 billion shares, each share would have earned $5.40 in net profits. But because the company managed to reduce the share count to 4.5 billion, each share represented $8.28 in net profits. That's why a successful buyback that actually reduces share count over the long term looks like (of course, we cannot definitively say that buybacks were the ""best"" use of shareholder capital over that time period because that money spent on buybacks could have instead been spent on dividends, acquisitions, or capital expenditure projects, but we can demonstrate the ways in which the buyback program has increased the earnings per share for shareholders over time)."
Advanced Micro Devices 10% Yield,Jan. 7.13,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) develops advanced processing units and microprocessors used in a variety of computers, supercomputers and game consoles. Last year was particularly difficult for the company; revenue declined in four consecutive quarters (Dec. 2011 - Sept. 2012,) gross profit fell and net income turned negative.From 2009 through 2011, AMD performed well, even though research & development expenses were significant. AMD impressed when Titan, a supercomputer made by Cray Inc. (NASDAQ:CRAY) achieved 20 petaflops using AMD processors.

Berkshire Hathaway Intrinsic Value Pie Chart,May.13.13,"IntroductionInevitably investors will look at the individual Berkshire pieces to a greater degree when Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are gone.There have been some major developments (including the Heinz deal) since my January 15th Berkshire article. Having recently returned from the latest shareholder meeting, it is time for me to make a new intrinsic value pie chart.Sources:1. 2013 Q1 10-Q2. 2012 Annual Report (includes letter to shareholders)3. Christopher Owens Berkshire article4. My last Berkshire articleThis intrinsic value pie and its slices are rough approximations ($ in billions).Intrinsic Value SummaryAdd: Operating Businesses: 176.5bAdd: *Investments: 132.3b (changes to prevent negative slices)Add: *Excess Cash: 34b (changes to prevent negative slices)Add: *Interest Free Loan: 10b (changes to prevent negative slices)Less: Holding Company Debt: 13.4bLess: Derivative Contract Liabilities: 6.7bLess: Float Liability: 24.3bEquals: Intrinsic Value: Around 308bNegative SlicesPie charts can't have negative slices so we'll start by deciding what slices need to take a hit because of liabilities.Holding Company DebtPer the 2013 Q1 10-Q, there is 13.4b in debt under Insurance and other (it was 13.5b in Dec 31, 2012).We know from past filings that the company issued 8b aggregate par amount of senior unsecured notes in connection with the BNSF acquisition in 2010.BNSF does not become less valuable because the company used notes to help pay for it. We'll take this 13.4b out of the cash piece of the pie.Derivative Contract LiabilitiesThe company has 6.7b in derivative contract liabilities. 6.2b is from Equity index put options and 445m is from Credit default. This lowers the value of our investment portfolio so we'll take it out of a slice on the investment side."
Why IBM's Success Will Continue,Jun.11.13,"For decades, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been praised as a technology bellwether and a superb innovator. Recently, however, the stock has lagged the broader averages, rising only 5-6% over the past year while the S&P gained 24% during the same period. This underperformance may be an opportunity to gain exposure to this tested industry leader, and more broadly, the technology sector as a whole. IBM has a long history of strong performance through good times and bad, and this dominance doesn't look to be ending any time soon.IBM is an information technology, or IT, company that generates income by helping its clients solve business challenges and become more efficient. They use their hardware, software, and financing to help clients cut costs and generate revenue. IBM is a dominant innovator, with nearly 67,000 patents secured since 1993. In fact, Big Blue has been the top recipient of patents for 20 consecutive years, and in 2012 it received 6,478 new patents. This outpaced the combined patents for Accenture (NYSE:ACN), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) during the same year. This impressive statistic shows that IBM knows how to create products that continue to generate excitement and, more importantly, a constant revenue stream for the company.IBM's competent management team has steered the company through a variety of challenging situations and has continued to create shareholder value. Ginni Rometty, the current Chairwoman and CEO, is a veteran of the company, having been with IBM for 32 years. Rometty has been listed on Fortune magazine's ""50 Most Powerful Women in Business"" for 8 consecutive years, garnering the #1 spot in 2012. Before taking the position of CEO, Rometty held the title of Senior Vice President and Group Executive for Sales, Marketing, and Strategy. This rise through the ranks of IBM shows that Rometty has the experience needed to keep the company on the cutting edge of the IT industry. Having taken the CEO position in January of 2012, however, Rometty needs more time before her true leadership abilities are shown. Until then, her prior record at IBM means that Rometty is ready for her role at the helm of the company."
IBM: The End Is Near,Jul.10.13,"Given the stresses and strains on IBM's (NYSE:IBM) operating model, a day of reckoning appears to be fast approaching. It won't be the end of the company per se, but it'll be the end of their business model as it's currently configured. The company reports earnings one week from today (July 17), and if it's anything like the Q1s report, shareholders should brace themselves. It could get ugly.In Q1, as you may recall, IBM missed earnings expectations for the first time in eight years. If it hadn't been for a fortuitous change in the estimated tax rate (cough), the earnings miss would've been 34 cents (instead of 5 cents). The more important metric is sales. Sales declined 5% in the first quarter, a dramatic drop when you consider two-thirds of IBM's revenue base is recurring.Revenue is the key metric to watch in next week's report. Unless IBM can generate top-line growth and soon, management's plan to reach $20 in earnings by 2015 falls apart.How Did IBM Get Into This Mess?As I suggested in an article last December (""Is IBM In Trouble?"") and again in April (""IBM: A Disaster In The Making""), IBM is the victim of a massive paradigm shift. The IT industry is moving toward lower cost, off-premise, multi-tenant computing architecture (known as ""the cloud""), and away from capex-heavy, on-premise computing. IBM will make a lot less profit in the cloud -- which is why the company is straddling the fence, trying to embrace the low-margin cloud while defending a declining high-margin legacy business. It's not a workable strategy, and someday soon IBM management will have to take a ""time out"" (i.e., pull earnings guidance) to craft a strategy more appropriate to the environment.The biggest problem facing IBM right now: The model is not designed to deal with a rapidly changing environment. It's not built to adapt and innovate. It's geared to meet quarterly earnings targets, aided by aggressive cost cutting and share buybacks.By the way, don't presume IBM can acquire its way out of its predicament. Companies positioned for the IT industry's paradigm shift to the cloud are crazy-expensive. IBM paid five times revenue, or $2 billion, in a recently completed acquisition of SoftLayer, a mid-tier cloud company that will generate about $400 million in low-margin revenue this year. The elite companies in the space, such as Workday (NYSE:WDAY) -- which won't be profitable for years -- are priced at more than 10 times forward revenue."
IBM Has A Cash Flow Problem,Nov.10.13,"Many long-term investors have followed Warren Buffett into IBM (NYSE:IBM) on the ""buyback thesis."" In essence, while IBM has been struggling to grow revenues and profits, it has been aggressively buying back shares, thereby pushing up earning per share and the share price. It is in this vein that some actually cheered the drop following IBM's most recent quarter as it could repurchase a higher number of shares for the same amount of money. While I understand the logic in this thesis, I would not be a buyer of IBM here.First, underlying business fundamentals matter. Rarely do companies in decline prove to be strong investments. Since 2008, IBM has been unable to grow revenue, and revenue has declined in six consecutive quarters. Importantly, during the last five years, IBM has spent over $17 billion on acquisitions. In other words, it has a negative organic growth rate as competitors like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), SAP (NYSE:SAP), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) have taken share. CIOs have plenty of cloud and business service companies to choose from; it is no longer IBM and no one else. At some point, IBM needs to begin growing again if it is going to sustain cash flows.While the company has been pivoting towards service, hardware is still a significant part of its business, and the company reported a truly stunning 40% drop in China hardware sales with sales in the emerging market down 22% overall in its most recent quarter. These trends have all been getting progressively worse. IBM is a company that has truly lost its mojo. The quarter lacked any signs of a turnaround, and I expect 2014 to bring negative year over year growth.I believe a reason for this has been the company's dogmatic focus on its five year EPS roadmap. When companies focus on hitting near term earnings target, they often will push off investment or focus on financial engineering to deliver good short-term results with disastrous long-term consequences. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) under Mark Hurd is a good example of this. In no sector is this truer than in technology where heavy investment is required to maintain a competitive advantage. IBM would be better off throwing out its guidance, focus on the core business, and reposition the company for growth in the future. Instead, management continues to stick to its plan of pulling various levers, namely buybacks, to boost EPS while the business is on fire."
Why IBM Lost The CIA Contract To Amazon,Oct.22.13,"There's been a flood of news about how International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) lost a lucrative $600M CIA cloud contract to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in early 2013, and the appeal.What's amazing to me is that there's been almost no explanation of why IBM lost, and why Amazon won. I promise I'm going to make it super easy to understand exactly why it happened.Before I reveal the secret, let's look at what happened at the top level. The short history is that Amazon won, then IBM protested, but then Amazon won the protest. That back and forth is rather typical with government contracts. However, that ""ping pong"" activity doesn't explain why IBM lost. That's what investors really need to know.Here's why all of this is so ""crazy"" to outsiders. Many people still think of Amazon as a giant online bookstore, or maybe an online equivalent of Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Therefore, I think it's worth taking a very quick detour to recalibrate investors.Amazon Web Services in a NutshellI encourage anyone unfamiliar with Amazon Web Services, or ""AWS"", to read the AWS Overview. Not only does it offer a very good overview of Amazon's cloud computing, it also provides you with a firm grounding in just how serious Amazon is about technology.And, to drive home the point, in Amazon's own words:""Using AWS, you can requisition compute power, storage, and other services in minutes and have the flexibility to choose the development platform or programming model that makes the most sense for the problems they're trying to solve. You pay only for what you use, with no up-front expenses or long-term commitments, making AWS a cost-effective way to deliver applications.""This wasn't hatched yesterday. Amazon has been selling AWS since 2006, mostly to small enterprises and start-ups. Now they service hundreds of thousands of customers and they manage billions of dollars of commerce every month, and of course the U.S. government.Analyst Ben Schachter (Macquarie Securities) estimates that in 2013, AWS will have revenue of about $3.8B. And, by 2015, AWS will be approximately 7% of Amazon's revenue. We'll see. But, no matter how you slice it, this is a billion dollar line of business for Amazon."
Comparing IBM's Hardware Segment With Its Competitors,Jun.11.13,"The systems and technology segment generates a substantial portion, 17%, of International Business Machines' (NYSE:IBM) total revenue. The performance of the hardware segment has been a drag on the company's consolidated performance. In this report, IBM's hardware segment's performance will be compared with competitors Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ), and Dell Inc. (NASDAQ:DELL). Is IBM's poor performance company specific, or is the hardware industry going through a period of declining revenue? How does IBM's performance compare to competitors?In the first section, the components of the hardware segments of the companies will be covered. The second section covers the historic performance of the hardware segments. The final section discusses the historic performance of the hardware segments.The recent performance of the hardware segments were poor, generally. I don't think there will be much improvement in the current fiscal year. That said, IBM's performance was in-line with its peers while Dell led the pack.Defining The Hardware SegmentsIBM's systems and technology segments is comprised of its systems, storage, and microelectronics businesses. The systems business provides a range of general purpose and integrated systems designed and optimized for specific business, public, and scientific computing needs. The storage business provides data storage products and solutions that allow clients to retain and manage rapidly growing, complex volumes of digital information. The microelectronics business provides semiconductor design and manufacturing primarily for use in IBM systems and storage products as well as delivering semiconductors and related services to external clients.HP hardware segment was formerly known as the Enterprise Servers, Storage, and Networking segment. The segment consists of four parts: The Industry Standard Servers, Business Critical Systems, Storage, and Networking. Industry Standard Servers offers primarily entry-level and mid-range ProLiant servers, which primarily run Windows, Linux, and virtualization platforms from Microsoft, VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW) and other major vendors and leverage Intel and AMD x86 processors. Business Critical Systems delivers our mission-critical Converged Infrastructure with a portfolio of HP Integrity servers based on the Intel Itanium processor that run the HP-UX and OpenVMS operating systems, as well as HP Integrity NonStop solutions. The storage offerings include storage platforms for high-end, mid-range and small business environments. The switch, router and wireless LAN products deliver open, scalable, secure, agile, and consistent solutions for the data center, campus, and branch networks."
IBM: Bet On Big Blue's Boom?,Jun. 5.13,"Let's get to right down to the ""meat on the bone""; if you take a look at IBM from a financial analysis perspective, the first item that jumps out is that IBM has an absurd return on equity, an ROE that blows away both Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). IBM's ROE is over 85%, compared to Apple's mere 31%. Never fear, the ROE is real and the stock could easily see over an annualized return of 22% over the next year and a half.Let's dig into the IBM fundamentals and look at it from a DuPont Analysis standpoint to see exactly why IBM has an ROE nearly triple that of Apple.In breaking down the ROE components, we see that Apple actually has a higher net profit margin and the two trade in line with respect to total asset turnover. However, it's the equity multiplier where the two, Apple and IBM, greatly diverge. IBM has been on a tear over the last 10 years of growing debt and shrinking shareholders' equity (more on that later), putting its debt-to-equity ratio at upwards of 1.75 and helping IBM generate returns on equity of over 85%.But even when accounting for IBM's debt load, the company still generates an outsized return on invested capital."
"IBM: Owner Earnings, Owner Earnings Yield And Payback Years",Oct.29.13,"Beyond IBM's MoatI believe that IBM (NYSE:IBM) is a great company. For qualitative reasons, I believe that it will beat the market for many years. For example, I've previously summarized my thinking about IBM's Moat.However, I haven't provided enough of a quantitative analysis of IBM for my readers. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to explain how I think about the cash that IBM generates and why this type of cash is meaningful to investors.Before I dig into the analysis, I first need to explain the concept of Owner Earnings. Then, I need to explain Owner Earnings Yield. And finally, I need to explain Payback Years.Once that foundation is in place, I will show you my analysis of IBM with respect to all three. Let's get started.Warren Buffett on Owner EarningsSo, here's the story. About one year ago I was reading Buffett's 1986 letter Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. He explained how he and Charlie Munger thought about Owner Earnings:""If we think through these questions, we can gain some insights about what may be called ""owner earnings."" These represent (NYSE:A) reported earnings plus (NYSE:B) depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges such as Company N's items (1) and (4) less ( c) the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume. (If the business requires additional working capital to maintain its competitive position and unit volume, the increment also should be included in ( c) . However, businesses following the LIFO inventory method usually do not require additional working capital if unit volume does not change.)""I thought that this was a very rational explanation of Owner Earnings. The problem? How can you easily calculate this, and how can you easily look at it over several years.Then, I found Jae Jun's article about Owner Earnings. He summarized Buffett's thinking very simply, like this:"
CA Technologies - Know The Name But What Does It Do And Is It Cheap?,Sep.11.13,"CA Technologies (NASDAQ:CA) may well be a technology name that you have heard of but struggle to know exactly what it does.The company describes itself as an entity that works to ""manage, monitor and secure underlying infrastructure"" for clients. Typically the core infrastructure is a mainframe and CA Technologies is a strong number two (24% market share) in this area to a small company everyone would have heard of called IBM (33% market share).The second aspect of the business is to boost its credentials in the broader enterprise management/security and related area where it can start selling 'software as a service'. I thought this graphic captured the opportunity the company is seeking:This is very much a business turnaround opportunity and it is being headed by a new CEO - Michael Gregoire - who joined the company early in 2013. His vision is laid out fully in this useful link but in essence it is to push into these newer areas, assisted by evolutions to the way the company undertakes R&D and its marketing and sales forces - bloated by too many years of 'easy' mainframe computer business - work.It is a tough task though. Not only are companies getting more picky but business conditions clearly remain difficult. Sales have fallen for the last five quarters although the mainframe business remains solid, renewals are still high and innovations continue (web 2.0 interface etc). The company also retains 600 patents with a further 600 'under review.' Guidance for FY14 remains flattish."
How To Get Over 10% Annual Returns For 20 Years,"Sep. 16, 2013 8:15 AM ET","Earlier today, I added some data to my personal notes on the performance of some typical blue-chip dividend stocks over the past twenty years, comparing the performance of the company with dividends reinvested to the same company with dividends paid out, but not reinvested. In case you're curious about the performance differential over a twenty-year period, here's what I found:1. If you invested $10,000 into Exxon (NYSE:XOM) in 1993, and did not reinvest the dividends, you would have 610 shares today. That would be worth $68,000 at current market prices and the oil shares would be paying you $1,537 in annual dividends today.But if you chose to reinvest your dividends over the past 240 months, you'd have 1,019 shares today. That would be worth over $90,000, and would generate $2,567 worth of growing dividend income every twelve months. With ExxonMobil's dividends reinvested, the compounding works out to over 11% per year.2. If you bought $10,000 worth of Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) stock twenty years ago, and did not reinvest the dividends, you'd have 1,520 shares today worth $107,000. That amounts to a little over $2,000 per year in dividends. But if you reinvested along the way, you would have 2,235 shares today paying out $3,039 in annual dividends. You could sell your Colgate stake for a nice starter home (~$132,000), because your Colgate shares compounded at 13.8% annually over the past twenty years with dividends reinvested.3. Now, let's take a look at Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). With no dividends reinvested, a $10,000 JNJ investment in 1993 would be 1,015 shares today worth $113,000. You could count on JNJ for $2,679 in annual income, or $7.34 each day just for waking up in the morning. But if you chose to reinvest your dividends, the results get even better-you'd have 1,559 shares today worth $138,000 and paying you a little over $4,100 in annual dividend income (now we're talking $11.23 per day just for waking up!) because your investment would have compounded at 14.1% over the past twenty years."
You Don't Need $2.5 Million To Retire,"Nov. 9, 2013 11:38 AM ET","You don't need $2.5 million to retire. Or perhaps you do, I have no way of knowing your individual situation, needs, expenses or preferences - but that point is neither here nor there. Recently I came across an article titled, you guessed it: ""You Need $2.5 Million To Retire."" What struck me about this article was that it was neither particularly egregious nor especially useful - which in my mind is outright dangerous as its conclusions would then seem ""plausible."" More specifically, the article actually does a reasonable job of pointing out the obvious: people need to be more aware of their financial situation, the sooner you start the better and paying yourself first can sidestep the psychological pain of delaying gratification. Yet using a blanket declaration like ""you need $2.5 million to retire"" is a misleading statement at best, a downright harmful one on the margin.Incidentally, the financial consultant who was interviewed for the article never indicated that one needed $2.5 million to retire. Rather, he suggested that one might spend $2.5 million in retirement. (Publishing sensationalism at its worst I suppose.) Frankly I believe that even this number could be overstated, but let's work with this figure for a moment.According to this website the average length of retirement in the U.S. is 18 years. Now I have no idea if this is an accurate statement, so to be on the safe side let's up the ante and call it 50 years. You can quibble about a decade here or there, but I would surmise that a 50-year retirement plan would take care of the majority of protests. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the average income before taxes for each ""consumer unit"" last year was $65,596 - or roughly $50,000 after taxes. Incidentally this is quite similar to the average annual expenditure per ""consumer unit."" Note that according to the BLS' data, a ""consumer unit"" consists of 2.5 persons, 1.3 wage earners and 1.9 vehicles. We'll keep things simple and call it a $50k salary for a couple."
Lexmark International: Why Is A Printer Company Trying To Reduce Print?,Jun. 3.13,"Lexmark International (NYSE:LXK) is transforming its business model from a hardware-centric company to a solutions provider. Lexmark's history is rooted in providing printing solutions. However, in this digital world where content has been named ""king,"" Lexmark's future is taking wing to solve information challenges by not just providing, but synergistically combining, output management, content management and process management.The technological advancements in the printing industry changed business. In 1959, Xerox (NYSE:XRX) first produced photocopiers. In 1975, IBM (NYSE:IBM) introduced high-speed laser printers to business. By 1984, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) supplied households with a laser model. In 1989 and Canon (NYSE:CAJ) brought color laser printing.When businesses adopted the Internet in the early '90s, it introduced the ability to exchange information electronically, dramatically impacting traditional printing and paper-based communication. Although the elapsed time to exchange information was greatly decreased, users were routinely frustrated with incompatible file formats. Factor in nothing short of an explosion of data as the floodgates opened. That explosion led businesses to grapple with the distinction between ""data"" and ""information."" Characteristics such as the quality, validity, legality or currency of data, information or content was, still can be, and often should be questioned. Significant investments are being made by 73% of CEOs to extract value from their companies' data.In 1999, the Uniform Electronics Transactions Act (UETA) established the legal equivalence of electronic records as viable forms of agreement. During the '90s, businesses quickly found their workflow processes and storage systems were not effective or efficient for handling both paper and electronic records. Automation was necessary. The scanning, electronic storage, classification and retrieval of paper documents became a priority. Software known as Document Management Systems or Electronic Document Management met the needs while also providing automated workflow, change history tracking and secure access."
"Investing In Graphene: The Good, The Bad And The Ugly","Aug. 29, 2013 2:37 PM ET","Graphene is a single layer of carbon - practically transparent, 100 times more electrically conductive than copper and 200 times stronger than steel. Graphene has been touted the 21st Century's miracle material which, like plastic or silicon, will have a profound impact on industrial production. Graphene may even provide employment for out-of-work lawyers (bless).Figure 1: Visual representation of Graphene - ""atomic chicken-wire""Source: Wikimedia CommonsI felt compelled to write this article as the ""Invest in Graphene"" articles that I've read to date don't differentiate between the companies that have an exposure to graphene and those that really don't (perhaps so not to upset their sponsors). However, as I explain below, when it comes to investing in graphene investors face a clear choice between good, bad and ""ugly"" stocks.The Good (but providing relatively limited exposure)If you're a value-oriented investor, you'll have plenty of choice from established large cap stocks, which are spending heavily on graphene research. Recently retrenched Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), which sports a P/E ratio of 6.6 and holds over 400 graphene patents, looks like a shoe-in. Given that graphene is still in a fundamental research stage, network linkages are important by integrating graphene production with end-usage. In this Samsung also excels through its cooperation with Korean research institutes, notably Sungkyunkwan University which is the world's second largest patent holder (although allowing for some overlap with Samsung's patents).Lack of network linkages is arguably where IBM (NYSE:IBM) falls short in its graphene research efforts. Granted, IBM is big enough that there may be no need for external partners, but their graphene cooperation (limited to an unknown Egyptian research institute), looks miserly. To date IBM's most insightful conclusion from its research seems to be that for semiconductors (an area IBM would benefit from a breakthrough most) graphene won't replace silicon. This is due to the difficulty in creating a band gap using graphene (although new research has shown this may be accomplished by using bilayer graphene)."
Is Unisys A Valuable Dinosaur?,Jul.17.13,"Looking at Unisys (NYSE:UIS) seems like looking at a dinosaur. The company has been around forever, with its roots in American Arithmometer Company, founded back in 1886. In this regard, Unysis is even older than International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), founded in 1911.The market seems to think the same. It seems to think that a giant asteroid hit Unisys' world, and that it's left for dead and has no chance of coming back. The asteroid could be client-server computing, cloud computing, the rise of the PC and a thousand other trends. Unisys is certainly seen as an obsolete provider of mainframe computing, with no place in today's world.But it reality consistent with this view? Perhaps not. After all IBM was once in Unisys' place and it came back. Indeed, it even got Warren Buffett interested. And today, IBM trades at a rich 8.9 times EV/EBITDA, as a result, even while showing slightly reclining revenues year-on-year.Let us look at Unisys, then, and see what we come up with.Revenues and businessOne thing that Unisys has are declining revenues.UIS Revenue TTM data by YChartsThese, however, are now expected to show an improving trend, with the decrease in revenues getting smaller. And indeed, consensus estimates for 2014 already show an expected stagnation in revenues (+0.6% year-on-year). This is not yet very evident in a revenue growth chart, though.UIS Revenue Quarterly YoY Growth data by YCharts"
Cornerstone OnDemand: Growth Story As Competition Vanishes,Aug. 8.13,"Competition can kill you. Recently, I highlighted how Skyworks Solution (NASDAQ:SWKS), RF Micro Devices (RFMD), TriQuint (TQNT) and Avago (NASDAQ:AVGO) were making it impossible for Anadigics (NASDAQ:ANAD) to find a footing. This time, I'll look at the other side of the coin: Sometimes competitors get taken out - leaving a company a greater runway for growth. That's the case with Cornerstone OnDemand (NASDAQ:CSOD), the talent management SaaS company, which has found increasing opportunity for growth as its rivals get acquired one by one. This last quarter, revenue growth accelerated, climbing a whopping 66% Y/Y in large part because of weakened competition. The takeover of its adversaries disrupted Cornerstone OnDemand's space, leaving a virtual vacuum as the key personnel left. Gone are the former COO of Taleo and the CEO of SuccessFactors. Kenexa's innovators exited. In other words, as SAP (NYSE:SAP), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) bought SuccessFactors, Kenexa, and Taleo, the talent went out the door. Simply, Cornerstone OnDemand is outcompeting the shells left behind.BackgroundCornerstone OnDemand provides talent management on the cloud using 4 platforms: Recruiting Cloud, Learning Cloud, Performance Cloud, and Extended Enterprise Cloud. Shares have appreciated over 170% since its 2011 IPO. Cornerstone OnDemand has a $2.5 billion market cap. This quarter, revenues reached $44.3 million, up 66% Y/Y and better than expected. Bookings rose 55% Y/Y. Non-GAAP earnings were a trace better than last year, coming in at -7 cents.Weaker Adversaries Provide OpportunityCornerstone OnDemand used to compete against 3 independent SaaS providers - Taleo, Kenexa and SuccessFactors - before they were taken over. IBM bought Kenexa in 2012. Oracle acquired Taleo later that year. SAP grabbed SuccessFactors this year. These take-outs have worked to Cornerstone OnDemand's advantage. Every time, one of its rivals is acquired there has been an exodus of crucial personnel.Example: Taleo"
The Stock Market Will Never Fall Again!,"Jul. 22, 2013 11:20 AM ET","That is the sentiment on Wall Street, at least for the time being. This giddy and blindly bullish sentiment often riddles the media through guest appearances after equities get influenced higher by the smaller investor. This is exactly what has happened during the Great rotation, and it is exactly what often identifies major market peaks.Once they get the little guys to chase the market, Smart Money usually watches for the right time, and then starts selling into the rally. When International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and General Electric Company (GE) surge the day earnings are released, even though the companies actually reported lower revenues and forward projections were not increased, we have evidence of a giddy market driven by investors who are reacting to the news instead of paying attention to valuation.Eventually this will change, and the writing is on the Wall.Furthermore, investors are currently balking at any market decline, almost worried, but these vocal investors very well may be the same investors who rotated out of bond funds and into the stock market recently as well. They took losses on their bond fund investments, their brokers told them that they could get growth and income by investing in the Stock Market, and without paying attention to valuation they followed, driving equity prices higher than they should be given reasonable growth expectations.Last week I recorded a Webinar that identifies the fair value of the S&P given earnings growth expectations, and by every measure analysts are extremely optimistic about the next year, but they were forced to bring down their optimistic estimates for the current quarter by 10% from where those were a year ago as well. Current valuations are lofty, with trailing as-reported P/E for the S&P 500 now over 19. I expect that to adjust down to an 18x handle after this season, but there is one big catalyst.Apple Inc. (AAPL) is expected to release earnings after the bell on Tuesday, and that will play a significant role, but roughly 25% of S&P companies will report earnings this week, and that combination will likely give analysts enough information to make the forward adjustments necessary to bring their current estimates in line with fair and reasonable growth, at least for next quarter."
Considering High-DGR Dividend Growth Stocks,"Sep. 3, 2013 11:49 AM ET","There is a cohort of dividend growth stocks that have always fallen below my minimum threshold of 2.7% yield, but which have high dividend growth rates that make them attractive to some investors. These stocks come up often in comments and portfolio holdings as among the favorite dividend growth stocks.These high dividend growth rate (DGR) issues seem particularly attractive to younger investors, who often feel that with several decades of compounding ahead of them, high DGRs are more important than high yields. They feel that they have plenty of time to develop excellent dividend streams. Examples of names that typically come up are IBM (NYSE:IBM), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), and Exxon-Mobil (NYSE:XOM).Because of their low initial yields, these stocks have never made it past my initial screenings for my annual Top 40 Dividend Growth Stocks. But maybe they should. Using my 10 by 10 concept, you can get to 10% yield on cost within 10 years for a low-yielding stock if you project high enough DGRs. For example, a 2.5% initial yield, if boosted by 15% per year for 10 years, will end up with a 10.1% yield on cost by the end of those 10 years.I have been reluctant to consider such stocks in the past, because while your initial yield when you buy a stock is locked in, projections of future DGRs are forecasts that have an element of speculation. The farther out you go, and/or the higher DGR you project, the more speculative the exercise becomes.That said, it is not unknown for a stock both to post an annual dividend increase and also to have a 10-year DGR greater than 15%. Currently, two stocks have done it: Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) and Stryker (NYSE:SYK).So I am wondering if my minimum initial yield requirement has been too restrictive. With this in mind, I decided to scour the most recent Dividend Champions and Contenders for possible candidates with lower yields but with high enough 10-year DGRs to make it to 10% yield on cost within 10 years.Here's what I did. I took the Dividend Champions spreadsheet (All CCC tab) and re-sorted the stocks three times to create three screens"
Dividend Cash Cows For Stable Retirement Income And Capital Growth,"Sep. 5, 2013 9:06 PM ET","While pundits say that you should have about 30 stocks for a fully diversified portfolio, truth is, it's fairly difficult for an individual investor to track and manage 30 stocks. It's a lot easier to manage between 5 and 15 stocks. So I like breaking my asset allocation strategy into little chunks where I can build mini-portfolios for each piece. For example, for low-risk dividend income, capital growth and capital preservation for retirement, I would have done well, and still will, with a small diversified portfolio of the following five dividend cash cows - IBM (NYSE:IBM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), AT&T (NYSE:T), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) - spread across information technology, oil and gas, fixed and wireless communications, materials and consumer foods and beverages.I've picked these five for their rock-solid dividend performance, inexpensive valuation ratios relative to the past ten years, fundamental business strength, strong operating history over the past few decades and robust growth prospects over the long run.Dividend AristocratsOf the five dividend cash cows, all but IBM are on the S&P 500 2013 Dividend Aristocrats Index - an exclusive up-to-date list of 54 companies that have consistently raised dividends for each of the past 25 years.As the table below shows, over the past 20 years, these dividend cash cows have raised dividends between 4% and 15% and have fairly high dividend payout ratios that range between 32.6% at the low end and 63.4% at the high end. And while their current yields are not excessive and range from a modest 2.1% to a reasonable 5.3%, the sums of their current yields and annual dividend growth rates are very compelling, ranging from 8% (MMM) at the low end to 17% at the high end. It is this combination of steady dividends and sustained dividend growth that I find compelling for reliable dividend income for a retirement portfolio, where you can rest easy knowing dividends are pretty much guaranteed with these five."
Accenture: Invest In A Company That's Investing In Itself,Aug.15.13,"OverviewAccenture Plc. (NYSE:ACN) has provided management consulting, technology, and business process outsourcing services worldwide since 1989. Accenture, since its inception and division from accounting firm Arthur Andersen, has helped to unlock profits to many Fortune 500 clients through its expertise in technology. In 2001, Accenture went public with an initial public offering price of $14.50 per share. Since then, Accenture has rewarded loyal investors by increasing to $70/share (August 2013). Recently the share price has seen a sharp decline, reaching a new 6-week low on Wednesday, August 14th.Recent Financial PerformanceBy analyzing the 1-year performance for Accenture, we can clearly see a gradual uptrend, which came to a screeching halt following its earning call on 27th June 2013. In the earnings report, Accenture announced a cut to its revenue outlook for fiscal 2013. In addition, Accenture lowered its expected growth to 3-4% from an earlier stated 5-8%.Excerpts from the 3rd quarter results reported in June make clear that the performance outlook was heavily impacted both by customer geography and service offerings:We can clearly see that Accenture has been heavily impacted by the economic and political turmoil in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) and the Asia Pacific regions. While economic difficulties tend to have a positive impact on outsourcing as companies seek to reduce costs; consulting services are often seen as not vital to operations and are therefore first on the corporate chopping block."
Is Apple's Controlling Nature A Strength?,Sep. 9.13,"SA Author Dan Ramsden wrote an article titled: Why Apple's Controlling Nature Is a Core Assest, Not a Flaw. There are many who share a view that Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) controlling nature is a strength. This article is a follow-up to Dan's original, and will attempt to take the reader through an alternative viewpoint for their consideration.For a quick trip down memory lane; remember the early days of personal computers when AAPL decided to go the route of controlling both its hardware and software with an iron grip. To APPL's dismay, just like a toddler that doesn't like to share its toys, we all know how that ended and continues to bode for its marketshare of PC's.This is a sharp contrast to the other side of the story, where open ended IBM (NYSE:IBM) compatible PC's that ran Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows and Unix based operating systems, faired much better by exploding in growth and as a result clearly won the PC arms race.The point here is to consider that the very same thing is happening now with APPL in the smartphone industry. Juxtapose history with Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) free Android OS, and compatible like manufacturers. Compare this to the ease of adoption and pirating that took place with the Windows OS (which is essentially the same as the low barrier offer of ""free"" in Android's case)Although AAPL has other means of generating revenue to say the least, and are by no means in dire straits, what ends up being puzzling is that what had caused AAPL a failure in the past seems to be at risk of being repeated to some degree.To drive this point home, Android now accounts for a massive 75% of all smartphone OS's in use. This is a sharp contrast to APPL's iOS which currently sits at 16.9%, and is projected to increase by only 1% within the next 4 years! This is a scary thought for any AAPL shareholders, and I don't think that the iWatch is going to increase marketshare drastically. Moreover in the end the iWatch may not be the innovative product that many are hoping AAPL needs to release in order to reinvigorate its fans."
Our Favorite Tech ETF: A Low-Cost Way To Tap Into Mobile-Computing Growth,Nov.11.13,"By Robert GoldsboroughAs the U.S. stock market has continued its climb in 2013, investors in large- and mid-cap U.S. technology stocks might wonder whether there's much more runway left. Certain technology subsectors, such as Internet and semiconductors, have done very well, while some tech players, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM, have underperformed both the sector and the broader market.The bull case for the U.S. technology sector revolves around companies that have lagged the broader market but are expected to benefit nicely from continued strong growth in mobile computing, such as Apple, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Broadcom (BRCM). These firms all possess structural competitive advantages, economic moats, reasonable valuations, and exposure to mobile computing. Further gains in the tech sector likely will come from companies benefiting from mobile computing, such as these firms.For investors interested in technology, we recommend Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT). The fund offers an inexpensive way to tap into some of the best parts of the U.S. tech sector, such as its continual growth, its ""moaty"" aspects, and its growing income potential, while at the same time providing a certain stability for investors.As a sector-specific exchange-traded fund, VGT should be viewed as a tactical investment, suitable only for the satellite portion of a diversified portfolio. Over the past five years, VGT had a volatility of return of 20.7% compared with 18.0% for the S&P 500 Index.VGT holds mostly large, well-established technology firms and holds a large number of stocks (414). It does have a top-heavy aspect to it, with its top-10 holdings making up a significant 53.5% of the portfolio. At the same time, VGT has a very high-quality portfolio--wide-moat and narrow-moat firms account for about 51.5% and 31% of the portfolio, respectively, meaning that Morningstar's equity analysts believe that more than 82% of VGT's assets are invested in firms with sustainable competitive advantages."
Dividend Yield Or Growth: The Role Of Payout Ratios,"Jun. 25, 2013 9:48 AM ET","Fairly often investors who are chiefly concerned with a growing stream of income quibble over which is more desirable: a higher initial dividend yield or a higher dividend growth rate. Often the deliberation comes down to one's time horizon. For example, if you have a shorter investment time horizon then it is expected that you might prefer a higher yield. On the other hand, if you have decades on your side it's presumed that the advanced rate of payout growth will eventually win out. It seems logical enough. In fact, I have previously commented on both ""quantifying the yield vs. growth tradeoff"" and ""finding the sweet spot."" Yet I think I can add another lens from which to view the debate.Let's start with a quiz. Would you rather have a 3% current yield with a 45% payout ratio or a 2% starting yield with a 30% payout ratio? Now unless you have a one-year time horizon, which is focused solely on income, then it seems like you would want more information. For example, perhaps you would like to know the relative value of each security. Although certainly not perfect, one way to judge this might be the price-to-earnings ratio. What's interesting to me is that I've already told you that both securities have the same P/E. Here's the math:Price can be restated as the dividend divided by the dividend yield (D / Y). For example, a $2 dividend with a 2% yield indicates a price of $100. Earnings can be restated as the dividend divided by the payout ratio (D / Payout). For example, a $2 dividend with a 30% payout ratio indicates earnings per share of $6.67. Taken together, the commonly cited P/E ratio can be restated as (D / Y) / (D / Payout). Using some middle school algebra, this equates to the payout ratio divided by the current dividend yield (Payout / Y). In other words, using a price of $100 and an EPS number of $6.67 equates to a P/E of 15. Yet you can also get to that number by dividing the payout ratio by the current yield (30% / 2% = 15). So in our example both the 3% yield with a 45% payout ratio and the 2% yield with a 30% payout ratio have a P/E of 15 (45%/3% = 30%/2% = 15). The same holds true for a 1% current yield with a 15% payout ratio or a 4% yield with a 60% payout ratio."
Which Is Best: DRIP Or Collect And Invest?,"Dec. 5, 2013 10:02 PM ET","IntroductionInvestors desirous of creating a common stock portfolio capable of providing them financial support in their retirement years have several options to choose from. The more aggressive investor might turn to designing and building an aggressive growth stock portfolio. However, aggressive growth stocks can be both risky and volatile. I wrote extensively about this approach in a previous article found here.In contrast, the more conservative or prudent investor might prefer building a long-term portfolio comprised only of high-quality blue-chip dividend growth stocks. Of course, these are not the only options. Portfolios could be created as a combination of both pure growth and dividend growth stocks in any combination that would fit the individual investor's own unique goals, objectives and risk tolerances. However, the focus of this particular article will be exclusively based on the utilization of blue-chip dividend growth stocks during the accumulation phase.Before I go on, it should be noted that this article is only addressing common stock portfolios. In other words, I am neither recommending only stocks, nor am I suggesting the exclusion of other asset classes as preferred choices. Instead, I'm simply dealing with investing in common stocks within the context of this article. The utilization of other asset classes employing fixed income, etc., would be the subject matter of separate articles.Moreover, this article will be specifically addressing how dividends would, or should, be reinvested. Essentially there are two primary options or methods that investors can utilize to reinvest their dividends. The first option would be through a dividend reinvestment program, more commonly known as a DRIP program. With this option, the investor directs their custodian to automatically reinvest all dividends received from their stocks directly back into the company. Most blue-chip dividend growth stocks and custodians have programs set up to accommodate this option. For more detail on how DRIP programs work, I direct the reader to the excellent resource promoted by fellow Seeking Alpha author David Fish."
FalconStor's CEO Resignation Likely Means Further Downside Ahead,Jul. 5.13,"FalconStor (NASDAQ:FALC) is a name that I have recently profiled as a struggling firm up for sale following a series of unfortunate developments. I questioned whether there would be any interested parties, particularly as the company's core business appears to be in long-term secular decline. Now, on July 1st, the firm's CEO Jim McNiel resigned to ""pursue other opportunities"". This is unfortunate news and has significant implications for investors speculating on a buyout.Did FalconStor Blow It Back In 2007?In 2007, when shares of FalconStor traded north of $13/share, it was widely rumored that [[IBM]] would be interested in acquiring the firm. While neither company ever officially commented on these acquisition talks, where there's smoke there's generally fire. Back then, FalconStor was en fuego and industry analysts were projecting that the Virtual Tape Library market would be worth north of $1B in 2007, representing a 303% projected CAGR at the time. Back then, an acquisition seemed to make sense, particularly as IBM was a big customer of FalconStor's, which is why the shares continued their upward climb up until the recession hit.Fortunately for IBM and unfortunately for FalconStor, this alleged acquisition never took place, as shares are now worth just 1/13th of their peak value, and the massive growth in Virtual Taple Libraries never happened. In fact, quite the opposite ended up taking place.Why An Acquisition Today Will Be DifficultLook no further than the very helpful glossary of storage terms provided by EMC on its website to understand just why FalconStor's technology is so hard to sell. Here is a key excerpt from the website's description of Virtual Tape Libraries,Virtual tape libraries (VTLs) ingest data over a Fibre Channel interface, which enables seamless integration with many existing backup infrastructures and processes. However, most backup software supports direct backup to disk over standard file protocols such as Network File System (NFS) and Common Internet File System (NASDAQ:CIFS), eliminating the requirement to emulate tapes."
Nokia Corporation: Strong IPR Portfolio Could Push Prices Even Higher,Sep.25.13,"Nokia Corporation (ADR) (NOK) shares rallied a massive 60% after the announcement of the firm's deal that would see it fully acquire Siemen's (SI) 50% stake in the Nokia-Siemens joint venture. According to Credit Suisse analysts, this was, perhaps, one of the clearest indications of the full extent of the negative value associated with Nokia's handset business. Nokia's IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) is, however, one of the firm's bright spots. The company still has significant potential to further grow its value creation, primarily through its IPR segment. Shares of the Finnish firm may still rise about 20% from current levels.IPR portfolio a real gemNokia's impressive IPR portfolio, reflects the patent agreement deals the firm has with Apple, Inc. (OTC:APPL), Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) and BlackBerry (BBRY). According to the Credit Suisse analysts, since Nokia is no longer in the handset business, the company can use these patents in multiple areas. Presently, the company is not licensing to all mobile players, meaning that it can now partner with vendors in Japan, Korea and China, a move that can potentially increase its royalty rate by about 40%. Nokia can also choose to renegotiate the deals that have been taken over by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) once they attain their expiry date. Nokia also has similar deals with Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI).Nokia currently has 10,000 patent families which include 30,000 patents and applications. Just 10% of these are licensed, meaning that the company still has a good opportunity to cover the entire CE and computer market. That should not prove to be too hard, especially when you consider the wide range of patents that the company owns, from OS and interfaces to component and hardware design."
Pitney Bowes's Dividend Cut: At Least That's Over With,Jun.25.13,"Although Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI) is struggling to hold on to its sales, we previously considered it as an investment based on its (at the time) 10% dividend yield (before its recent dividend cut of 50%) and its free cash flow yield of 16%. Although it is a potential good value, it is struggling due to its streak of revenue declines. In hindsight, we think maybe Pitney Bowes' former CEO Michael Critelli's deal-crazed acquisition spree was not the best thing for the company's health. From 2000-2007, Pitney Bowes spent $2.5B on 83 acquisitions. PB's stock was dead money from 2000-2007 and has deteriorated since then. PBI hired Marc Lautenbach away from IBM (NYSE:IBM) to serve as its new CEO in 2012. Other new hires by PBI included Mark Wright as its new Software Division President and Mark Shearer as its EVP and president of the SMB mailing solutions business in April. We also think investors are relieved because the dividend cut has already happened but it still yields 5.3% and that is still well above the 2.03% on the S&P 500.Source: Morningstar DirectCorporate Highlights or Lowlights (depends on your view)PBI announced recently that its sales continue to sag. PBI's revenues declined by 4.4% in Q1 2013 versus Q1 2012 levels. PBI's adjusted EPS declined by 19% year-over-year as the company's revenue declines were coupled with a 57bp increase in its operating expenses. Three of its business units registered incremental revenue growth but this was not enough to offset revenue declines from six of its business units that ranged from 2% to 20%. At least PBI was gracious enough not to blame its losses on currency headwinds.PBI's EBIT declined by 19% in Q1 2013 compared to Q1 2012 primarily due to steadily declining sales performance. PBI's Production Mail business unit generated 3% revenue growth and 10% EBIT growth and was the only PBI business unit to generate positive revenue and EBIT growth. PBI's Small and Medium Business Solutions division saw its EBIT decline by 13% and its Enterprise Business Solutions division saw its EBIT decline by 36%. PBI's stock sold off by 13% the day after its Q3 2012 results were released, shot up 20% the day it released its Q4 2012 earnings and gave up 16% when it announced its 50% dividend cut. We think that the 5.3% yield and no longer having to deal with the suspense of a dividend cut is helping to buoy the value of its shares as PBI's share price has increased by 4% in the two months after falling by 16% when it cut its dividend per share."
Should We Want Stock Prices To Go Up Or Go Down?,"Sep. 27, 2013 2:02 PM ET","One of the recurring comments I read on the Dividends and Income board periodically is investors wishing for prices to decline. Based on comments by other investors along those same lines it also appears to be one of the most misunderstood comments as well. In many cases it is either taken or used out of context.On the surface it appears to be a no-brainer. Of course you want prices to go up. That's how your portfolio increases in value, when the prices of your stocks appreciate. But in reality there is more than one way to look at the stock price (I'm excluding shorts). So should a dividend growth investor, especially one such as myself who is retired, want stock prices to go up or be content with them going down?It's Not Just The Price DeclineThere are multiple reasons for an investor to hope for lower prices but the price fluctuation should never be separated from the intrinsic value of the company to which the price pertains. In other words stock price should be considered hand in hand with intrinsic value to determine if a company is at a ""value"" worth spending your hard earned capital on at any given time. In his 2011 annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) shareholders (annual letters from 1977 to 2012 are available at this link) Warren Buffett said ""The first law of capital allocation - whether the money is slated for acquisitions or share repurchases - is that what is smart at one price is dumb at another."" If we as dividend growth investors are treating our investments as a business, which we should be, then we should view our purchase considerations as capital allocations and treat them accordingly. To put it bluntly, we should buy when it's a wise use of our money, and when it's not, don't. That should be obvious but quite often it's not.Buffett went on to discuss share repurchases in detail in his 2011 letter and there is a corollary to the dividend growth investor wishing for price declines. Using International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) as his example he demonstrates how if the IBM stock price remains stagnant while IBM is repurchasing shares Berkshire winds up owning more of the company than if the price rises. Consequently, the Berkshire share of the earnings would be greater under the lower price scenario than the higher price scenario and would result in the total share ownership being worth more at a later point."
Stock Investments For A Possible Market Decline,"Aug. 28, 2013 12:36 PM ET","First, I want to make clear that I do not predict a decline in stock prices for any particular reason or in any particular time in this article. Stock prices are mostly out of control of any individual investor and are notoriously hard to predict, thus I believe a long-term investor should not focus on ups and downs in the market. This certainly holds true for investors who want to limit their time and effort devoted to investing to a few hours a week. (I think this is what most people should do; they would do much better financially by becoming a specialist in their primary occupation, whether it is being an entrepreneur or an employee.)My aim is to think about strategies for sleeping well even during market turmoil. The current US stock market appears richly priced and I do not see any apparent bargains among larger companies. High valuations have often led to small returns in the last century, either because of a significant decline of market prices and the following ""catching up,"" or a prolonged period of measly returns.Moderate returns are not a big concern for me in this low interest rate environment: even a 5-6% return would be better than the current yield on safe long-term bonds. There are plenty of dividend growth stocks available which have dividend yields similar to long-term government bonds, but carry little interest rate risk and have been increasing distributions above the pace of inflation for decades (and it is very likely they will keep doing so in the future), thus I view stocks as clearly preferable to ""risk-free"" bonds in a stagnant prices scenario.On the other hand, steeper or prolonged market declines are psychologically uncomfortable. I firmly believe that bear markets and general stock price ""corrections"" will come in the future about as much as they had in the past---and with the same unpredictability. Larry Swedroe describes a nice framework for portfolio construction which distinguishes need, ability and willingness to bear the risk of investing in stocks instead of safe bonds (see this article, some of his books, or his column at CBS Money Watch for more on this topic). Without willingness, which includes the psychological capability of withstanding stock price movements and emotions associated with them, investing a large portion of your savings into stocks is a bad idea no matter how big your need or ability is. Therefore, I find it important to improve willingness. Some of my thoughts on the topic are shared in this article."

Ethics Issues At IBM: Will It Hurt Earnings?,May. 2.14,"Robert Cringely wrote a series of columns in 2012 in which he predicted IBM's (NYSE:IBM) ultimate demise because the company was ""rotten to the core."" To increase profits, he said top management had made the conscious decision to ""cheat"" customers in the form of a cut back in service. His columns generated massive page views and thousands of comments from readers, many of whom claimed to be IBMers or ex-IBMers.""Glad to be gone, but I wonder if my soul is intact""Is IBM really rotten to the core? The evidence, which I will share with you below, is stacking up, not that all of IBM is corrupt, but that there does appear to be a culture at the top of IBM that prioritizes earnings above everything.Above employees? Yes, there are thousands of passionate IBMers who will say so, and from all over the world. They have tried to make their voices heard in Cringely columns and elsewhere. I will share a few with you.Above customers? Yes, this is where it gets scary, where rotten to-the-core comes into play. To make earnings, IBM apparently takes it out of customers. A recent spate of legal actions add to the pile of evidence.Above technology? Yes, innovation and energy in enterprise IT is in the public cloud, an area IBM is dangerously behind in, as we'll learn below.Above ethics? Let's look at the evidence, beginning with two comments that followed Cringely columns. A specific mechanism of corruption at IBM India is explained in the first, and the second accurately predicts a breakout of corruption in India.In case you don't already know, India is the global center for IBM's service operations; the largest number of IBM employees work there (estimated 150,000).Posted April 20, 2012 by ""exIBMandenjoyingit""IBM is thoroughly corrupted inside and my former colleagues are playing the game. As US employees we accepted the internal corruption ourselves. We saw organizations providing bogus sales numbers yet we look the other way because we too may have been paid on those numbers.The IBM help desk in India participates in the corruption by closing older tickets and informing their internal customer to open a new ticket so that their time to resolution is not badly affected. This fish stinks through and though from decades of internal brain washing reducing employees integrity a little bit at a time.Glad to be gone but I wonder if my soul is intact."
Is The Market Right About Discounting IBM?,Feb.20.14,"Executive summary:IBM is experiencing short-term troubles such as the weaknesses in developing nations.Many analysts are deeply discounting the company as they blame it for boosting its EPS artificially buy repurchasing shares.Long-term trend still looks intact and the company's financial figures are near an all-time high; there is upside if it can keep up._________________________________The market seems to have a love-hate relationship with IBM. Sometimes, the company's share price will rally relentlessly for a couple years, other times it will head south for a while in a seemingly never-ending decline. Recently, IBM hasn't received much love from the market and many people are wondering whether this presents a buying opportunity.On January 21st, IBM announced its earnings for the fourth quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter, the company beat the estimates by a small margin ($6.13 per share vs. $6.00 per share) and for the full year of 2014, it offered a guidance a few cents above the average analyst guidance ($18.00 per share vs. $17.97 per share). After that, IBM went into a sell-off mode where the stock price fell from $188 to $172 even though it was already on a decline for the last year. For example, last April, the company's shares were trading for nearly $216. Since the earnings report, the share price recovered and passed $183 but this price still gives the company a low multiple against its future earnings; for example, the company is currently trading at 10 times its 2014 earnings. This discounted price implies that the market doesn't expect IBM to grow at all. In fact, the market actually expects the company's earnings to shrink considerably even though the company engages in financial engineering by buying large amounts of shares back in order to boost its EPS every year.IBM's year-to-year revenue decline caused a lot of concerns in the market and many investors are wondering if the company will continue to see growth in the near future. For the last 20 years, IBM has been focusing on products and services with higher margins rather than high revenues, but this practice proved troublesome for the company in emerging markets where local companies rely on cheaper service providers. Furthermore, IBM was hit by the recent strength of the US dollar compared to the currencies in many developing countries. These days, developing markets are a huge theme for the investors and if a company fails to post revenue growth in countries like China, investors tend to write it off as dead."
A Dividend Discount Model Valuation Of IBM Over A 5-Year Period,Mar.31.14,"The purpose of this article is to use the dividend discount model to determine a five-year price target for IBM for the year 2018. The company is currently trading at $190.75 (at the time of writing), and the author calculates a target price of $255 for the year 2018. This represents a 34% upside from the current price, and a 6% annual forecasted return.Methodology and AssumptionsSince 2009, IBM has succeeded in growing dividends and earnings per share at an average annual rate of 14.55% and 12.99% respectively.However, it is notable that while IBM has continued to increase its yearly dividend payout from 2009 to the present, the rate of increase has dipped slightly over the five years. In addition, while IBM has succeeded in growing earnings at a rate of 12.99%, the rate of earnings growth slowed down significantly in 2013 at a rate of 6.75%. According to the CNBC website, the analyst's 3-5 year EPS Growth Rate is estimated to be 15%."
"You Won't Believe It, IBM Is An Example Of Poor Earnings Quality",Jan.30.14,"Never did we ever think we'd be using Big Blue (NYSE:IBM) as an example of poor earnings quality, but its fourth-quarter results, released January 21, fit the mold. Let's first become acquainted with why assessing earnings quality is important. According to the Research Foundation of the CFA Institute:""Understanding the quality of earnings is an essential part of processing and interpreting information. A high-quality earnings number will (1) reflect current operating performance, (2) be a good indicator of future operating performance, (3) and fairly annuitize the intrinsic value of the company.""At Valuentum, there are five basic areas that we evaluate to assess the quality of a firm's earnings: a) is the company's earnings growth driven by higher-quality revenue expansion or lower-quality cost-cutting measures (can the trajectory of earnings be sustained with continued revenue increases because cost-cutting, by definition, is a finite activity?); b) has the company benefited from one-time items and/or an abnormally low tax rate to bolster net income (is the company shifting items from one period to the next?) c) has the company engaged in aggressive share buybacks to bolster earnings per share (is management incentivized based on return on invested capital or accounting earnings per share, the latter not always in the best interests of shareholders?); d) does the company convert 100%+ of its net income into cash flow from operations (are the earnings it generates truly cash earnings or are they more an accounting measure?); e) was there a large re-classification of costs and/or segments that muddied the performance (is the company trying to hide something?). There are other items to consider in evaluating the quality of earnings-including assessing depreciation methods and other more fraudulent activity that can impact reported net income such as creating fictitious revenue and/or failing to record expenses-but for the most part, the five reasons outlined above cover the topic quite well in practice."
IBM: The Owner Earnings Ratio Tells Us It's A Strong Buy,Jan.16.14,"This article will introduce my research on what we will call ""Owner Earnings Yield."" I have chosen IBM (NYSE:IBM) in order to introduce this research, as it is one of the largest holdings of Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A). Since owner earnings is Mr. Buffett's innovation, I cannot imagine a better way to test its validity, than to test it on Mr. Buffett's purchase.On February 27, 1987, Warren Buffett released his 1986 Letter to Shareholders as part of the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report for that year. That letter was probably one of his better-known pieces written as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) because it included a special section at the very end called:Purchase-Price Accounting Adjustments and the ""Cash Flow"" FallacyMr. Buffett provided, in essence, a tutorial on how both he and Charlie Munger select the important information in a company's financial statements. In doing so, he basically gave us their formula on how to successfully analyze companies. Here is that paragraph:If we think through these questions, we can gain some insights about what may be called ""owner earnings."" These represent (A) reported earnings plus (B) depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges such as Company N's items (1) and (4) less (C) the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume. (If the business requires additional working capital to maintain its competitive position and unit volume, the increment also should be included in. However, businesses following the LIFO inventory method usually do not require additional working capital if unit volume does not change.) Our owner-earnings equation does not yield the deceptively precise figures provided by GAAP, since must be a guess - and one sometimes very difficult to make. Despite this problem, we consider the owner earnings figure, not the GAAP figure, to be the relevant item for valuation purposes - both for investors in buying stocks and for managers in buying entire businesses. We agree with Keynes's observation: ""I would rather be vaguely right than precisely wrong."""
Stop Worrying About IBM's Revenues,Jan. 9.14,"IBM Revenue ((TTM)) data by YCharts2013 was a lonely year for IBM (NYSE:IBM) as it finished the year being the only stock of the Dow Jones Industrial Index in negative territory. The culprit pointed to by many was a lack of top-line growth. Many authors here alongside myself have pointed out this is strange logic that critics are using with IBM. After all what's more important, the top-line or the bottom-line, the latter of which IBM has an abundance of growth in? IBM's antithesis in this matter, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), further points out how attracted investors are to growing revenues at this time, even if the company isn't actually making any money.IBM operates in 5 main segments:Segment Revenues ($ in millions)20122011201020092008200720062005Global Tech Services40,23640,87938,20137,34739,26436,10332,32231,501Global Business Services18,56619,28418,22317,65319,62818,04115,96915,906Software25,44824,94422,48521,39622,08919,98218,16116,830Systems And Tech17,66718,98517,97316,19019,28721,31721,97020,981Global Financing2,0132,1022,2382,3022,5592,5022,3652,401When looking through this segmental breakdown certain trends become apparent. Importantly, Services have been experiencing growth, in addition to Software, which is the biggest area of growth. Systems and Tech is the main problem area with revenues. This is a much different story than if the revenue problems were seen throughout the various segments equally.First of all, IBM has been strategically divesting itself of low-margin businesses. 2005 saw them getting rid of their personal computing division and 2007 saw them getting rid of their printing business. As this process takes place IBM's total revenues will reflect the omission of these divestitures, but it allows IBM to allocate its resources to more profitable areas. The resulting increase in gross and net-margins is a big reason why even with stagnant revenues IBM has been able to drive up net income so much. $25 billion in Software revenues (which has a gross margin around 90%) is a lot more valuable to the company than $25 billion in Systems and Tech revenue. This is why despite being only 24% of the overall company's revenues, Software ends up being 44% of its pre-tax income."
IBM 2013 Cash Flow Analysis,Jan.22.14,"All over the Internet we can find automated or semi-automated free cash flow (or Owner Earnings) calculations for IBM which most of the time provide only the information that the author did not read IBM's financial statements or even that accounting is not his forte. So let's try to get this straight immediately after the Q4 earnings statement.Why do I focus on free cash flow instead of net income? First of all, the cash flow statement is not so easy to manipulate under GAAP than the income statement. Probably you have already read this somewhere else. But how would this work?The cash flow statement provides details on a company's cash cycle, i.e. the process that converts sales into cash: E.g. cash is used to build inventory, or inventory is sold and converted into accounts receivables (because customers usually don't pay immediately); when cash is received as customer payments, receivables are reduced.For example, a company may legitimately record a $1 million sale but, because that sale allowed the customer to pay within 30 days, the $1 million in sales does not mean the company made $1 million cash. If the payment date occurs after the close of the end of the quarter, accrued earnings will be greater than operating cash flow because the $1 million is still in accounts receivable. … An example of income manipulation is called ""stuffing the channel"". To increase sales, a company can provide retailers with incentives such as extended terms or a promise to take back the inventory if it is not sold. Inventories will then move into the distribution channel and sales will be booked. Accrued earnings will increase, but cash may actually never be received, because the inventory may be returned by the customer. While this may increase sales in one quarter, it is a short-term exaggeration and ultimately ""steals"" sales from the following periods (as inventories are sent back). … The operating cash flow statement will catch these gimmicks. When operating cash flow is less than net income, there is something wrong with the cash cycle. In extreme cases, a company could have consecutive quarters of negative operating cash flow and, in accordance with GAAP, legitimately report positive EPS. In this situation, investors should determine the source of the cash hemorrhage (inventories, receivables, etc.) and whether this situation is a short-term issue or long-term problem.

IBM's Culture Is Its Best Long-Term Investment Metric,May. 1.14,"International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is one of the world's most representative corporate social ecologies. If it were a city, its population would place it in the top forty cities of the United States and Brazil, the top ten of Malaysia, the top five of France and the top two of Romania or Norway. Its representation from 175 countries would make it one of the world's most ethnically diverse and highly educated.In just over three decades, this corporate metropolis has expanded 20%, from 341,279 employees to 405,535, then contracted 30% to 278,039, only to grow again by 70% to a historic peak of 463,785.1 The strain this would put on any social infrastructure is unimaginable. Therefore, although economics may write headlines, it's important to push past just an economic evaluation. It was IBM's century-old social network that held it together, and this is what we must study to assess its future and decide on its value as a long-term investment.As you will see, IBM's corporate ecology returned for Watson Sr. a compound annual growth rate of 16.7% over thirty-two years and for his son Watson Jr., 20.9% over sixteen years. This corporate society also returned 29.1% for Louis V. Gerstner; but in Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? he rebuffs the notion that the Watsons' belief system contributed to his success. The Watsons, in their humility, were always the first to admit that it was not them, but their employee-owners. Tom Watson Sr. put it simply in 1939, ""no business can be run successfully on a one-man basis.""2"
Revenue Growth: What Has Happened To IBM's Sales Culture?,May.12.14,"From last week's article (IBM's Culture Is Its Best Long-Term Investment Metric), here are the yearly revenue growth numbers over the last century achieved by each of International Business Machine's (NYSE:IBM) Chief Executive Officers -- from Watson Sr., IBM's founder, through the current Chief Executive Officer, Ginni Rometty.The Watsons' 20th century sales culture produced amazing revenue growth for IBM's first eight decades, but the results of the last two have been inconsistent. To evaluate if there is revenue growth in IBM's future, a look at the past provides some interesting insights. Revenue per employee is an effective method to visualize sales productivity changes over time. Though it is only one of many measures for considering the overall health of a corporation, this particular one -- especially when evaluated over extended periods of time -- reflects sales effectiveness.IBM's Sales Culture -- The Early YearsSales morale in any organization is dependent primarily upon the men at the top and is based on their knowledge of the business, their personality, their integrity and their moral character.Thomas J. Watson Sr., Human RelationsIn 1930, the Great Depression was only a few months old when this statement, appearing in a feature article written by Watson Sr., placed the responsibility for the morale of a sales organization on the shoulders of the top corporate executives. It is one thing, though, to write an essay on a topic, and quite another to put your beliefs on display for every one of your employee-owners to witness."

A Moat Full Of Immortal Dinosaurs,Apr.22.14,"Warren Buffett (who actually introduced the concept of ""moat"" into business analysis) says: ""In business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats.""Many of the moats that protect businesses from their competitors are made of brand power, large scale and/or permanent cost advantages or intellectual property.With IBM (NYSE:IBM) as one of the largest investments in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) stock portfolio, we can be quite confident that Buffett saw a nice moat around Big Blue's business. However, during the 2013 Berkshire shareholder meeting Buffett said:I don't understand the moat around IBM as much as around Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). I have some understanding of it, but would have more conviction about the moat around Coke or Wrigley or Heinz than IBM, but I feel good enough about IBM that I put money in it, and nothing precludes Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM both being successful. In fact, I hope both are. We have enough conviction about IBM's position. I like their financial position. Odds are good. I don't feel the same degree of conviction about that than BNSF railroad. I can't think of anything going wrong with BNSF. I can think of some things wrong with IBM.Many investors interpreted this statement as an admission that Buffett was losing confidence. While I don't believe that a few bad quarters would change Buffett's ideas on IBM (remember that it took him several quarters just to build his position), it is certainly important to understand as much as possible about IBM's moat in order to be able to spot in time an eventual deterioration.So what is IBM's moat made of?"
The Chowder Rule Shows The Best Dividend Growth Stocks Of The Dow Jones Industrials,"Jan. 25, 2014 5:33 AM ET","What is the Chowder Rule?You may often find references to the ""Chowder Rule"" on Seeking Alpha. This rule was created by a contributing writer by the name of Chowder. He devised this rule to aid in the decision making process while pursuing a dividend growth investing objective.Keep in mind that this is only one tool you may consider in the investment process. Chowder only employs this rule after researching a company's basic financial strength. In order to qualify, the company must have a credit rating of investment grade; that means a BBB+ or higher from Morningstar. Further research is then conducted which you can read about at, ""It's All About the Fundamentals"".The stocks that pass these initial tests are then put to the Chowder Rule. The rule is quite simple. You first take the current yield of a stock and its 5-year dividend compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). Add these two numbers together and that gives you its ""score"".ExamplesExample 1: Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) has a current dividend yield of 3.0% and a 5 year CAGR of 8.8%. That gives PG a score of 11.8.Example 2: IBM (NYSE:IBM) has a current dividend yield of 2% and a 5 year CAGR of 14.27%. IBM's score is therefore 16.27.The following guidelines are then applied to the score:A Chowder score of 12 or greater is required when the current dividend yield is 3% or greater. If the current dividend yield is less than 3%, it must have a score of 15 or higher. Using this scoring system, you may invest in a lower yielding stock if it has higher dividend growth rate to compensate for the lower current income.In this case, PG with a 3% yield has a score of 11.8 which falls under 12 and therefore fails. IBM, on the other hand, with a dividend yield under 3% and a score of 16.27 and is over 15, so it passes and merits further research as a possible investment.There is one other exception to this rule. In the case of slower growing sectors, namely utilities, REITs, and telecoms, a Chowder score of only 8 is required. These stocks typically have higher yields and lower 5-year CAGR due to the nature of their industry. You can expect higher current income from these types of investments. The dividend growth going forward will be limited though."
Do Low Dividend Stocks Belong In A Roth IRA?,"Jan. 6, 2014 2:51 PM ET","The wisdom of holding a high dividend stock within the tax-protected confines of a Roth IRA is pretty self-evident because you are protecting the total returns of a cash-generating asset from the taxman by not exposing yourself to the dividend tax. For instance, a $10,000 investment in BP (NYSE:BP) over the past twenty years has paid out a total of $30,063 in cash dividends to its owners.With a payout like that, it makes strategic sense to protect that income from the 15% (or more) annual tax bites that would nibble at your gains with each passing year. The appeal of keeping your cash cows like oil giants, tobacco companies, and telecom firms inside of a tax-protected structure is that a lot of the total return consists of the dividends, and you wouldn't want to see that portion of your total return claimed by the government.A more interesting dilemma is trying to figure out whether companies with low dividend yields, perhaps in the range of 1% or 2%, are worthy of consideration for your IRA. The easy kneejerk response is to say ""no they don't."" The reason why companies like IBM (NYSE:IBM) may appear suboptimal in something like a Roth IRA is because most of the company's profits are naturally shielded from taxation; in the case of IBM, the company generates $14.47 per share in profits while only paying out $3.80 to shareholders as a dividend.About 75% of IBM's earnings per share are retained by management to grow, buy back stock, and pay down debt. If you own IBM in a taxable account, the fact that IBM pays such a low initial dividend makes it seem almost inconsequential to care about whether it belongs inside of something like a Roth IRA because most of the profits are shielded from taxation that you directly pay due to the nature of companies with low starting dividend yields that buy back large amounts of stock on behalf of owners.If your investing horizon is short to medium term (say, three to five years or so), then the conventional wisdom on optimal asset allocation could be worth following: low dividend stocks belong in taxable accounts, and Roth IRAs are for cash cow common stocks, high-yielding corporate bonds, and so on."
Will Flash Memory Spell The End Of The Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Industry?,"Jan. 28, 2014 7:05 PM ET","Monumental changes are taking place in the competitive storage industry, and changes are underway that could spell the end of the Hard Disk Drive (HDD) industry as we know it.Solid State Devices made from NAND flash memory chips, continue to gain market share versus HDDs. According to iSuppli, Shipments of PC hard drives are forecasted to decline by eight percent in to just 436.9 million in 2013. SSD shipments, on the other hand, are expected to increase 122 percent during the same period, to 68.9 million units by the end of this year. Since Intel's new processors and Microsoft's Windows 8 have both failed to boost demand for PCs, shipments of 2.5-inch hard drives for notebooks have been affected.According to IBM (NYSE:IBM) Table I shows the last 5 year history (2008 to 2012) of the growth of memory shipments for HDD and NAND. For this table, HDD units are drives and NAND units are 2 GB chips.Table 1Storage Memory Growth (2008--2012)Source: IBMThere are several issues apparent in this table:1. Units of HDD drives peaked in 2010 and has been dropping, so that the compound annual growth rate (OTCPK:CAGR) between 2008 and 2012 is 1.7%2. Unit shipments of NAND devices continue to skyrocket, exhibiting a CAGR of 74.8% I this same time period.3. Revenue growth for HDDs has been flat, and the uptick in 2012 was attributed to a shortage of HDDs due to a flood in Thailand in 2012 that shut down factories.4.

Why Cognizant Remains A Buy Even As It Crosses $100,Jan.16.14,"I had recommended Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) as a top software and service company to buy some time ago and had advised investors to sell IBM (NYSE:IBM), as I considered CTSH as a much better stock. I have been proved right on both counts, as IBM has declined while CTSH has seen its stock price increase. Cognizant has been an amazing stock for investors to hold over the last 10 years, having substantially outperformed not only its software peers but also the iconic technology companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company has very good management and has kept up the growth momentum, even as bigger peers such as Wipro (NYSE:WIT) and Infosys (NASDAQ:INFY) have faltered. IBM, the big daddy of software services, has seen its revenues stagnate for the last decade, even as Cognizant Technology has seen its stock price increase by almost 20x. Cognizant has benefited last year due to the tailwinds of rupee depreciation against the dollar and a slowdown in India's economy, which has led to declining real wages. We think that investors should look to buy dips as the company has proven itself both during the up and down cycles.FY 2015 growth is expected to be better than forecasted according to NASSCOMIndia's main software industry body NASSCOM expects that growth in FY 2015 will be better than FY 2014 (12-14% growth). This is on account of India's main markets of USA, Britain seeing stronger economic growth which will lead to more IT spending. Recent results by companies such as Infosys have beaten expectations as companies ride on the secular tailwinds of rupee depreciation and recovery in Western economies. Cognizant has typically grown at a faster rate than the industry and 20-22% growth in FY 2015 for CTSH should be considered a base case. The company is forecasting a growth of more than 20% in FY 2014.On the back of our strong second quarter performance, we are extremely pleased with this solid third quarter. As a result, for the second time this year, we are raising our full year revenue guidance. We now expect 2013 revenues of at least $8.84 billion, which would represent industry-leading growth year-on-year of at least 20.3%.Source - Cognizant Q3 Conference Call"
Apple's Inventory: The Sum Of All Fears,Feb.25.14,"When Tim Cook joined Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 1998, he made bold and ingenious decisions with Apple's supply chain. As a veteran from IBM (NYSE:IBM), Cook began cutting inventories and shifting manufacturing processes overseas. By the mid-to-late 2000s, Apple was known for its operational efficiency and inventory turns often in the high-80s or low-90s, signifying that it never had more than four or five days of inventory on-hand at any one point. Like most businesses, Apple's inventory levels change based on product cycles and consists of two distinct types:Balance Sheet Inventory: Comprises: 1) Finished Goods, and 2) Components (also known as Work-In-Process, or WIP).Off-Balance-Sheet Inventory: Comprises recognized revenue sitting with its channel partners for resale.Balance Sheet Inventory:Apple recently started breaking out its inventory levels between 'finished goods' and 'components' in its quarterly filings with the SEC. For the quarter-ending December 28, 2013 (fiscal Q1 - 2014), Apple reported inventory of $2.1 billion, which was broken out into:Finished Goods: $1.6BComponents: $523MFor a company that did $170B of sales in fiscal 2013, $2.1B of inventory does not seem like an excessive level. However, when you look at the amount of finished goods inventory, it seems unusually high. Consider this, Apple ended its previous quarter (fiscal Q4 2013) with $1.08B of finished goods inventory. The sequential increase of approximately 50 percent is significant. The total inventory at the end of the December-2012 quarter (fiscal Q1 2013) was $1.455B. If one was to estimate that one-third of that amount was components, the finished goods balance of approximately $970M was 65% less than the balance reported in December-2013 (fiscal Q1 2014).Does China Mobile factor in to the inventory level?There may be a good reason for this historically high balance of finished goods inventory - preparation for the China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) launch. On the January 2014 earnings call, Cook made it clear that Apple did not sell into the China Mobile channel during the December-2013 quarter (fiscal Q1 2014). This unusually high inventory level could be representative of stock-piled iPhone 5S units that were destined for China Mobile's launch, which occurred on January 17, 2014."
Why Cisco Will Not Kill Off Palo Alto Networks,May.27.14,"Investors of enterprise security giant Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) have felt anything but secure since shares hit a 52-week high of $80.84 on March 18. Since that peak, the stock has been down by close to 30%, hitting an intra-day low two weeks ago of $57.47. But they wouldn't stay down for long, rebounding by more than 15%, closing Friday at $66.99. Shares are up 16% year to date. But the share price gyrations are just some of the concerns investors have had.Although Palo Alto has secured a double-digit market share position in the network security space, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) has emerged as a worthwhile threat. And Cisco's $2.7 billion acquisition of anti-hacking giant Sourcefire (NASDAQ:FIRE) suggests that Cisco is going after Palo Alto's market position. But even with Cisco's size and scale, Palo Alto's capabilities are hard to trump.Palo Alto's next-generation technology have proven efficient in protecting company networks from virus attacks, malware and other security breaches. Its platform includes network firewall software and appliances. It also offers subscription services for threat detection and prevention, which has gained excellent traction within the enterprise.Don't discount that Palo Alto already generates above-average free cash flow margins, which is not expected for a growth company. Remarkably, management has been able to achieve this with less-than 15% market share.While Cisco is indeed a worthwhile threat, Cisco should be as fearful of Palo Alto. With the company due to report fiscal third-quarter report Wednesday, investors would be wise to buy this stock before margin leverage sends the shares higher."
Is Cloud Adoption Increasing In Financial Services?,"Jan. 31, 2014 12:26 PM ET","Even though the financial services industry has been slow to adopt the cloud, pundits are optimistic that the industry may have turned the corner. Gartner (NYSE:IT) asserts more than 60 percent of banks worldwide will process the majority of their transactions in the cloud by 2016. Ovum claims capital markets will accelerate their adoption of cloud this year. Are all these predictions rooted in reality?When Oracle's (ORCL) CEO declares that its main rivals are no longer IBM (NYSE:IBM) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) (he says his rivals now are Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) ), you know it's time to stop disputing the cloud's momentum. In the financial industry there are also plenty of strong indicators pointing to a significant uptick in cloud adoption this year.So, let's look into what some of these indicators are.If it's good enough for the CIA…With Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (and the government) accused of teaming up to share data and spy on us, the cloud still has some convincing to do when it comes to safeguarding information. Foreign institutions, in particular, have been very antsy about storing data with US based cloud providers.Nonetheless, even though security has long been a barrier, financial institutions are finally starting to trust the cloud (the fact that the CIA, has jumped into the cloud may also have helped). In fact, according to Ovum, regulatory compliance is expected to drive a 2014 increase in IT expenditure in the sector, with the benefits of cloud computing and growth prospects identified as main drivers. If the industry and regulators can help the cloud get over the security hurdle, adoption will increase considerably.Cloud vendors are becoming less blue sky and zeroing in on pain pointsThe cloud's main story so far has been one of horizontal providers such as Salesforce, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon, offering one-size-fits-all solutions that didn't address industry specific issues. However, vertical cloud (or SaaS) providers are now arriving. Set up to serve specific vertical or niche markets within financial services, these providers are set to grow rapidly during 2014. Financial industry cloud provider Navatar has already proved that the devil is in the details when servicing sub-verticals such as asset management, wealth management and investment banking. As highly specialized solutions speak to key industry pain points, expect small and large financial firms to rally behind them."
Analysts Rate Salesforce.com A Buy. They Should Be Ashamed Of Themselves,Jan.22.14,"The Customer Relationship Management (CRM) business made up an $18 billion market in 2012 growing at about 12.5% annually, according to Gartner. The big player is Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) with a 14% market share, followed by SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM (NYSE:IBM).The top ten fastest growing CRM vendors included only one of the largest players - IBM - which grew at 39% in 2012 to reach $649 million in revenues according to the Gartner data.On September 30, 2013 SYNNEX acquired IBM's CRM Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) unit for $505 million. The unit had sales of $1.2 billion and generated $120 million of EBITDA according to the release. If we are talking about the same IBM unit, the growth rate of 39% must have accelerated for it to be a $1.2 billion business 9 months after the end of 2012, but perhaps the two data points are not precisely similar. Regardless, it is pretty clear the IBM CRM business was both profitable and growing very quickly.What is wrong with this picture?SYNNEX pays $505 million for a $1.2 billion CRM business growing at a blistering pace and earning EBITDA at about 10% of revenues. The market puts a value on Salesforce.com of $37 billion for a business only three times larger than the IBM unit growing at a 25% pace and not earning anything to speak of. I may have it completely wrong, but either the CRM business unit of IBM reported by Gartner and the one sold to SYNNEX are different things or the gap in valuation between the market's valuation of Salesforce.com and what SYNNEX paid IBM for its unit is incomprehensibly wide.I think the units are comparable, and while it seems SYNNEX paid a pretty good price to IBM for this business unit, the market's valuation of Saleforce.com is so far out of the ballpark of reality so as to deny sensibility."

This article will focus on the fund's new holdings this quarter, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and Ritchie Bros Auctioneers (NYSE:RBA), both of which fit the quality durable business theme.International Business MachinesIBM is the quintessential reputation business. The old saying is that no one ever got fired for buying IBM, and that is even more true in IBM's services business. With a recent sale of its server business to Lenovo, IBM will be even more focused on businesses where it has a competitive advantage, like systems, software and services. These types of businesses are more susceptible to reputational advantages than its former hardware businesses. Servers are bought by engineers who can compare the technical specifications of each machine. Services are bought by the same people, but it is more difficult to compare them quantitatively, which means it's a bigger professional risk to purchase them from an unknown supplier, and easier to justify buying IBM.Arlington has recently initiated a position in IBM, suggesting they see some of the same value that must have attracted Warren Buffett to initiate a position. The company is trading well below its 52 week high, and at a considerable discount to its normal valuations. For more on IBM, see Intelligent Value's article on the company's intrinsic value."
Benchmark Electronics - A Compelling Growth Investment Among Small Caps,Mar.13.14,"At first glance, Benchmark Electronics (NYSE:BHE) looked like an ordinary commodity business. But after looking over the financial data, I think there's some untapped investment potential here. And if anything, the upside to investing into this company will most likely come as a combination of organic sales growth paired with manufacturing efficiencies.Benchmark Electronics what does it do?The company focused on third-party mechanical and electronic manufacturing solutions. It involves solutions from product design, prototype, and production.Source: Benchmark ElectronicsMechanical engineering is physical product assembly. Mechanical engineering is most commonly found in aerospace, vehicular assembly, manufacturing lines, special case engineering for buildings, etc. The electronic manufacturing side involves circuit boards, and integration of semiconductor components onto a circuit board. This part of the business has limited durable advantage as it doesn't require significant expertise to design the assembly of circuit boards. The company also doesn't have intellectual property pertaining to graphics, CPU, memory, or storage. It's likely to grow so as long as manufacturers of end PCs need a third-party to do component assembly onto a circuit board or component assembly that doesn't involve fabrication of silicon. Since every computer uses a circuit board whether it is in the form of mobile, wearable, desktop, laptop, car etc., the company should be able to grow unit volumes."
Gigamon: High-Growth Value Stock And Likely Takeover Candidate,May. 8.14,"Gigamon (NYSE:GIMO) is a network visibility, monitoring and security vendor that went public in 2013, and is still fairly undiscovered and unfamiliar to investors. It is not your typical IPO company as it has developed market leading technologies, has been profitable for several years, and is growing its top line at 25%-35% YoY.The company has grown top line in excess of 30% over the past several years, and this growth is expected to continue at 25%-35% given the company's nascent 7% penetration rate of its TAM. This future growth will come from underpenetrated enterprise markets including Fortune 1000 companies, international expansion, further penetration into the service provider market, and expansion into security offerings. The company's TAM (total addressable market) is estimated between $2 and $3 billion growing at double digits annually driven by cloud and big data, as well as the rapid transition from 1G Ethernet connections to 10G, 40G and 100G connections.Gigamon is a likely strategic M&A candidate given its technology and reasonable valuation. Among potential suitors are traditional switch and routing companies (Cisco, Brocade, and Juniper) as well as Oracle, IBM, Hewlett Packard, Dell, Riverbed, F5 Networks with Oracle, and Cisco making the most strategic sense.Oracle has made acquisitions of complementary technologies by buying session-border controller specialist Acme Packet and network optimization specialist Tekelec at premiums of 8 and 10 times their revenues, respectively. Gigamon's leading technology and products would bolster Oracle's fledgling network tools solutions and its hardware business (formerly Sun) in its effort to further diversify into enterprise network and service provider markets. Oracle needs Gigamon to solidify its data center, cloud and big data offerings as the industry transitions from 1G to 10G, 40G and 100G Ethernet connections. For Cisco, Gigamon's technology will be value adding to its switching and data center offerings. And Cisco has to cherish Gigamon's 75%-77% gross margins and targeted operating margins of 23%-28%. For both Riverbed and F5 Networks, acquisition of Gigamon would make strategic sense in terms of technology and addressable markets. For example, Riverbed acquired network performance specialist Opnet for 6 times revenues and already closely partners with Gigamon. It may also consider acquiring Gigamon to fend off the acquisition proposal by an activist investor Elliott Management."
Why The Allocation In Portfolios To The S&P 500 Is Sub-Optimal And What To Do About It,"Feb. 20, 2014 7:20 AM ET","Among my conversations with asset allocators, the anecdotal evidence suggests that the largest allocation in equity portfolios is the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY), which has become a proxy for ""the market.""However, traditional indexes such as the S&P 500 have major flaws in their construction. First, the indexes are market capitalization weighted. By the time companies become large constituents of the index, they're often past their innovative and high-growth phases, and more often than not act as a significant drag on performance.Consider the chart below. According to Ned Davis Research, ""popularity kills."" Since 1972, the S&P 500 increased nearly 5,000%. Yet, owning the top stock in the S&P 500 by market capitalization increased in value approximately 400%.Copyright 2013 Ned Davis Research, Inc. Further distribution prohibited without prior permission. All Rights Reserved. See NDR Disclaimer here. For data vendor disclaimers refer here.The stocks that have been among those carrying the highest weight in the index include AT&T (NYSE:T), Altria (NYSE:MO) (formerly Philip Morris), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), General Electric (NYSE:GE), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Most people would consider these to be ""good"" if not ""great"" companies. But, great companies do not necessarily make for great stocks.Another study (source: Daniel Solin) measured the performance of the S&P 500 from 1957-1997. During that time period, the index was up over 8,500% with dividends reinvested. However, of the 74 stocks in the index during the entire time period, only 12 stocks outperformed the index itself.In our own research, we extended a portfolio of holdings to include the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 by market capitalization. Typically, these stocks comprise approximately 20% of the index by weight. These too are household names and include Exxon, Apple, IBM, Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Microsoft, GE, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), AT&T, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). In our tests from 1983-2012, the S&P 500 increased over 2,600% while the top 10 stocks in the index rose in value just 800%."
Intel's Economic Moat,Mar.15.14,"Intel's Economic MoatIt is hard to think of a firm that has a more compelling economic moat than Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).The source of this moat is straight-forward: There is literally no firm on the face of the earth that has Intel's technical capability in mass producing digital logic chips-the electronic brains that power laptops, desktops, and servers. Despite similar financial resources, Intel's largest manufacturing competitors Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Global Foundries, and TSMC (NYSE:TSM) are still consistently one generation behind its production capabilities thanks to its manufacturing prowess. In an industry that, in a very real sense, has reinvented itself once every 18 months for the last half century, Intel has had a largely uncontested first mover advantage twice every three years.INTC data by YChartsValuation Drivers: RevenuesIt is a testament to the strength of Intel's microprocessor franchise that it has been able to maintain the revenue growth it has throughout the demand shift toward mobile devices. It has emerging market demand for PCs and demand for cheap, general-purpose servers to thank for that revenue growth. It is interesting to note that Intel's processors were originally considered data center also-rans. That is, until someone realized relatively cheap Intel x86 ""boxes"" could be chained together to approximate the power and performance of specialty chips manufactured by IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) Sun segment. In a twist of Tech Karma, companies selling processors based on designs by ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) may now be trying to eat into Intel's server share in the way Intel originally ate into Sun's and Big Blue's."
Which 5 Companies Will Profit From The Internet Of Things?,"Mar. 18, 2014 9:38 AM ET","In the first quarter of 2014, personal computers of one sort or another still comprise the internet. Phone? A computer in your pocket you use to make telephone calls. Tablet? A small computer without an external keyboard. (Though keyboards appear to be popular accessories.) And of course, the internet lives on your home or office desktop computer.But Emily Adler at Business Insider reports the internet as a tool for checking up on friends, buying goods and finding your way will soon be dwarfed by the internet as a tool for the machines -- from home appliances to transportation to business to industry to the electrical grid itself -- to talk to each other.The Internet of Things (IOT), that heterogeneous collection of man-made things empowered to talk to each other, will grow 374% in the next four years to over nine billion (with a ""B"") units implemented per year. That number is greater than all other smart devices (like phones, tablets, wearables and PCs) put together.Investment ideasThe future of IoT is diverse. Many companies that cover a variety of sectors are developing products for this breakout technological development.ManufacturingThe Milwaukee based Rockwell Automation (ROK) is in the eye of the coming IoT storm. Rockwell is already an industry leader in programmable logic controllers (PLC), human-machine interfaces, sensors, safety components, software and motor control centers. CEO Keith Nosbusch recently gave the keynote address at the 2013 Internet of Things Forum in Barcelona, in which he told representatives from leading IoT firms, like Qualcomm, Airbus, IBM, Oracle, Intel, Siemens and SAP that manufacturing, which used to be ""a technology laggard,"" is once again on the cutting edge of innovation."
The New Nifty Fifty: A Comparative Performance Analysis,"Dec. 8, 2014 7:28 AM ET","BackgroundA couple of months ago, Seeking Alpha contributor Mike Nadel posted a terrific collaborative article in which 10 of Seeking Alpha's most respected contributors and commenters independently forwarded their ""best 50 all-occasion"" companies for dividend growth investing (DGI). There were no submission rules regarding such things as dividend yield, dividend growth rates, or valuation levels for submission of companies. Rather, the colleagues were simply asked to submit what they thought were their top 50 DGI stocks. Mr. Nadel then went on to post the 50 companies that were most frequently cited by the 10 panelists. These consensus fifty stocks were dubbed the ""New Nifty Fifty"" in reference to the well-known collection of 50 stocks from the 1960s and 1970s that were widely regarded as buy and hold growth stocks (i.e., the original Nifty Fifty).Although Mr. Nadel's article provided a great starting point for investors to begin their own due diligence on the consensus stocks, I thought it would be interesting to take a look at the performance of each of the New Nifty Fifty stocks individually, as well as their averaged performance against a simple, passive mutual fund index such as the Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund (MUTF:VFIAX). Specifically, I was interested to know how each of the New Nifty Fifty stock's one-year and ten-year share price return and total return (dividends reinvested) ranked to one another and to the S&P 500 index using VFIAX as a proxy. I also wanted to know how the average performance of the New Nifty Fifty acting as a DGI index fund would compare against the VFIAX fund."
What Bull Market? The Dow Jones Industrial Average Is Flat Since 2007...,"Nov. 4, 2014 11:13 AM ET","When a bull market has ground on for some time bears in the crowd will begin to call it overpriced. After all they will point out that prices have run unsustainably higher. Words like ""bubble"" begin to grab the attention of the mainstream media, but rarely are rising prices put into their proper context. This article will point out that since the crest of the 2007 bull market the market capitalization of the Dow 30 has declined slightly when adjusted for inflation, even as the index has increased from a closing record high of 14,165 in 2007 to its most recent level of 17,391.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSEARCA:DIA) is a price weighted index that is generally inferior compared to the market capitalization weighted index known as the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY). However, because there are only thirty companies in the Dow, analysis is greatly simplified relative to the S&P 500.Recently it was reported that companies in the S&P 500 have spent a record $914B on dividends and buybacks this year representing approximately 95% of earnings. However, with the dividend yield of the S&P 500 standing at 1.83% the majority of this capital is being deployed to buyback stock. This is a historical anomaly, since 1871 the median dividend yield of the S&P 500 or its equivalent has been 4.42%, while the median earnings yield has been 6.86%. With more capital now being deployed to buyback stock one would expect prices to rise more rapidly as a greater percentage of the total return owed to a stock-owner is tied up in the price of the stock rather than being paid in cash."
Cognizant Technology: A Growth Stock With A Lot Of Potential,Aug. 2.14,"The Information Technology industry is one of the most important industries in the U.S. and is expected to grow further throughout 2014 as companies increase their spending on IT systems, infrastructure, software and services. According to Gartner IT Spending Forecast, the worldwide IT spending is projected to grow 2.1% in 2014 and about 3% each year for the next four years (see image below).Source: GartnerAs an investor who likes to look for multi-bagger (e.g. 100% or more gains) investments, I like to find great companies that have good long-term growth prospects that operate in favorable and growing industries. In the IT service industry, I believe that Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) will perform well over the next five years because of the increasing demand in the company's IT and consulting services.Here is a historical look at Cognizant's share price and diluted EPS growth over the past ten years:"
"Cisco: The Stock Appears Fairly Valued, But Beware",Nov.11.14,"As any Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shareholder can attest to, the stock has languished for quite some time. Below is a chart of the last five years for the stock price compared to the S&P 500:CSCO Total Return Price data by YChartsCan it return to glory?In this article, I will value Cisco based on several calculations that I use when deciding to buy, sell or hold a stock. Then I will discuss two other important metrics that, while not directly contributing to a ""Fair Value"" calculation, help me further decide if a stock is worthy of investment. Finally, I'll have a look at the technical picture.While these exercises are very useful, note that they are only the beginning of an investor's due diligence and research.Discounted EarningsThe average estimate as shown on Yahoo Finance for Cisco's next five years' EPS growth is 7.61%. Using that figure for five years, followed by 4% for the next 15 years and plugging in a discount rate of 10% gives a Fair Value number of $20.14.The Fair Value calculation is only as accurate as its inputs, so it is important to weigh the odds of Cisco living up to the 7.61% five-year growth that analysts are expecting. In the past five years, the company grew EPS at an average annual rate of 8.68%, so analysts are predicting a minor slowdown. The expectations are reasonable to me.Dividend Discount Model ValuationThe DDM method is a variation of the DCF method. The DDM was the brainchild of John Burr Williams in the 1930s who thought that a stock's worth should be calculated as the present value of all the dividends to ever be paid on it."

Is GE Creating Economic Value?,Nov. 9.14,"I recently published an EVA analysis on IBM, showing that the company is delivering significant economic value to shareholders in spite of recent weakness in earnings. In this article I am presenting a similar analysis for General Electric (NYSE:GE)What is EVA Analysis?Economic Value Added (EVA), is an estimate of a firm's economic profit - that is, the value created in excess of the required return of the company's investors (being shareholders and debt holders). Quite simply, EVA is the profit earned by the firm less the cost of financing the firm's capital. The idea is that value is created when the return on the firm's economic capital employed is greater than the cost of that capital and value is destroyed if the firms earning do not exceed its cost of capital. Looking at EVA created (or destroyed) over time can give us idea of the firms economic moat - is it increasing or decreasing? As a rule we want to invest in companies with a durable and strong economic moat or firms which are in process of creating such a moat. EVA Analysis can also shed light on turnaround situations. It can provides clues if a turnaround is working and whether or not a firm is coming out of a slump. For firms in cyclical industries it provides a clue as to where they may be in an economic cycle.EVA analysis has two broad components. NOPAT (net operating profit after taxes) and CC ( Cost of Capital). EVA is NOPAT minus CC.Calculations of NOPAT is straightforward and obtained from the income statement - I took GE's operating profit and deducted provisions for income tax from it."
How Hewlett-Packard Plans For The Future,Oct. 7.14,"Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ) deciding to split into two different ventures, HP Enterprise and HP Inc., comes as a great shock to the tech community. Long considered the biggest name in PC and printer sales, HP has been in a long decline as mobile devices, tablets, and cloud computing became the new world order for businesses and individuals. HP under former CEO Mark Hurd tried to keep up by acquiring companies like Compaq in the bet that HP's size and financial stability, in conjunction with buying smaller but similar companies, would keep costs under control and HP products competitive.Unfortunately, the acquisitions didn't prevent HP from continually losing sales, and has left current CEO Meg Whitman with the risky choice of splitting the company into two in an attempt to keep the brand name relevant. A risky move for a typically conservative businesswoman, Whitman's strategy signals the need to change course from the ""five year plan"" she had brought to the company in 2011, as well as recognition that under the current business model, HP will not be able to get back to their mid-90s heyday. By splitting the company into hardware (HP Inc) and software entities (HP Enterprises), each can do its own thing without pulling the other one down, a common issue of being too big.Why Whitman wants the EnterpriseWhitman's tenure as CEO of HP can be characterized as an attempt to be as forward thinking as possible in regard to the future of the company. She was brought on as a problem solver, and immediately went to work trying to reverse HP's fortunes. However, the expected turnaround point was supposed to come this year, but declining sales and loss of market share have stymied that. Splitting the company had to be done because the PC and printer unit, HP's bread and butter, were lagging, and the push into software and cloud computing was clearly the main focus of HP's future."
Salesforce.com: Slowing Growth Could Turn Out To Be A Good Thing,Dec.16.14,"Shares of leading CRM company Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) have taken quite a hammering ever since the company issued weaker-than-expected revenue guidance for fiscal 2016. As of midday Monday, the stock has tanked roughly 8.5% since November 19 when CRM revealed it expected revenue growth in the coming fiscal year to clock in at $6.45 billion-$6.50 billion, or 20%-21% growth. For a company that has been growing its top line at a 30%-plus clip over the last five years, the low guidance was disconcerting and caught many investors by surprise.Source: StatistaSalesforce.com has richly rewarded long-term investors; the stock has been a 10-bagger, climbing more than 1,000% since the company went public. Despite it's impressive growth, Salesforce's bottom line has been nowhere near as impressive. The company has not reported a GAAP profit since 2011. Salesforce enjoys the same equivocations as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) - both companies have managed to make investors comfortable with red ink. While slowing growth is nothing to be proud of, the trend might actually be a blessing in disguise.Slower Growth Might Allow Salesforce To Become ProfitableOne chief characteristic of pure-play SaaS companies such as Salesforce, NetSuite (NYSE:N), Workday (NYSE:WDAY), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), Concur Technologies (NASDAQ:CNQR) and others is that they sport high sales and marketing expenses as a percentage or revenue."

"The New Nifty Fifty, Part 1 - Dividend Growth Style","Oct. 15, 2014 5:04 PM ET","While researching and writing my previous article about how an investor in the famed Nifty Fifty stocks of the 1970s would have fared four decades later, I couldn't help but wonder what a new, improved Nifty Fifty might look like today.And as a practitioner of Dividend Growth Investing, I was especially interested in a Greatest Hits collection of proven income growers: companies highly likely to pay and increase dividends for decades to come.Rather than merely presenting my choices, I solicited input from some of Seeking Alpha's most respected voices. In asking them to name their DGI Nifty Fifty picks, my request went on to say:""I know that ideally a list might change a little depending upon an investor's age or circumstances, but please name your best 50 'all-occasion' DGI companies. Beyond that, I have no requirements that companies be (Dividend Aristocrats) or that they have a minimum yield or that they have a certain level of dividend growth or that tax implications are considered. They can come from any sector or country. They need not be fairly valued at this time, either. Having said that, if you want to give yourself guidelines pertaining to any of those things, that's perfectly fine.""Ten Seeking Alpha colleagues agreed to participate, and they combined to name 160 companies. Though some critics claim DG investors all pick the same stocks, the 10 panelists agreed on only five names. Several selections don't even pay dividends, as attempts were made to identify great companies that eventually might be aggressive income growers. And so, we are reminded once again that DGI isn't a one-size-fits-all strategy.Without further ado, here (in alphabetical order) is our esteemed panel:Chowder: A prolific commenter who also writes an extremely valuable Instablog, he is the ""conscience of DGI"" on Seeking Alpha. He popularized the oft-quoted ""Chowder Rule"" (current yield plus 5-year dividend growth)."
Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust: 10% Yield With A Value Focus,Dec.10.14,"If you're looking for a value focused investment, Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (NYSE:GDV) should be on your list. A 10% managed distribution is a big part of the appeal, as is the around 8% discount to net asset value, or NAV. But don't overlook the investment approach and willingness to tell shareholders what's going on under the covers.Cheap, sort ofValue investing is about finding stocks that are trading cheaply relative to what they're worth. Figuring that out isn't easy, but it's something Mario Gabelli and his asset management firm have been doing since 1976. Only they take a slightly different view of value than Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, the fathers of fundamental analysis.Gabelli describes its variation on Graham and Dodd as ""Private Market Value (PMV) with a catalyst."" PMV is defined as, ""...the price a strategic acquirer would pay for the entire enterprise."" But the asset manager isn't just looking for cheap stocks, it's looking for stocks that it believes will see the discrepancy between its PMV and market price narrow via a specifically identified event or change.Now what asset managers say and what they do don't always match up well. And far too often you're left guessing what's really going on anyway. But that's one of the best things about the Gabelli funds, both open- and closed-end varieties, they tell you what they're thinking every quarter. It's one of the big reasons I like Gabelli's fund products.Here's what we thinkFor example, in Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust's September 30th report, it highlighted its top holding and explained why it owned them. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was on that list, which might have you scratching your head. How is Apple a value stock?Here's the gist of it: Apple is a global tech leader, with high-end products that have managed to avoid the ""...ruinous price competition and profit margin volatility that impede other firms in its sector."" And it's just been through a new product cycle, proving that new CEO Tim Cook is capable of running things now that Steve Jobs isn't around to help."
Intel's Data Center Group May Contribute $9 Billion To Annual Profits By 2018,Nov.24.14,"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shared a lot of information in its investor day presentation (free registration required to view presentation videos). However, for this specific article, I'm going to spend the bulk of my time talking about the data center group.In a prior Seeking Alpha article I stated:The shipment aspect of the equation will improve considerably going into FY 2015, as demand will likely be robust in an environment where a refreshed product lineup will drive both performance and power efficiency gains. I'm extremely confident in the upside prospects for Intel because the server segment has significant growth potential. Plus, the total addressable market for servers is already large and will become even larger.Information from the investor day presentation provides further confirmation of my stance pertaining to servers.Four distinct areas will drive data center growthSource: IntelDuring its investor/analyst day presentation, Intel made the case that data center revenue will grow at 15% CAGR over the next four years. This figures very well into Intel's cost structure as a huge component of the company's operating costs are fixed, meaning incremental volume above breakeven will drastically improve profitability. Hence, EPS is expected to grow at a much higher rate than revenue."
My First Year On Seeking Alpha: Pick Performance And Article Stats,"Jul. 10, 2014 9:24 AM ET","It has been exactly one year since I became a Premium Contributor on Seeking Alpha after my first article was published on July 8, 2013. Being a part of the Seeking Alpha community has been a wonderful opportunity to interact with investors, educators and other Contributors, and to have a productive outlet for my creative and analytical energies. I was inspired to write this article not only for my own understanding of the scope and impact of my effort, but also because I have often seen other Contributors voice a desire to have better insight into their own efforts. This article is not an attempt to stroke my own ego or measure my performance against anyone else, but rather an opportunity to reflect on my presence in the Seeking Alpha community over the last twelve months.WORD COUNTIf someone were to tell myself in high school that I would ever enjoy writing, I would tell them that they must have had me mistaken for someone else because at that time the thought of writing even a double-spaced, two page paper was intimidating. Every article I have written on Seeking Alpha exceeds that length! Over the course of the past year, I penned 21 articles which were published on Seeking Alpha, excluding this one, which in aggregate contained 28,589 words, or 160,995 characters. While the median word count of my articles was 1,239 words, my shortest article, Coca-Cola: Don't Miss Out Like I Did, contained 1,001 words and was my fourth most viewed article over the last twelve months, and my longest article by word count, Roadmap To Higher Returns: Earnings Vs. Cash Flow, contained 1,985 words and was among the bottom quartile of my least viewed articles.PAGE VIEWSI must admit the slight twinge of discouragement I felt when my very first submission to Seeking Alpha was declined for publication was completely replaced with excitement when I saw the page view counter tick higher and higher with each passing hour the day my first article, 4 Opportunities Using Dividend Growth Rate And Yield On Cost, was published. That same excitement has accompanied every subsequent release of one of my publications and is undoubtedly a motivator to continue writing for Seeking Alpha. Having never previously had the opportunity to reach a global audience, knowing that my 21 articles have generated more than 127,000 page views over the last twelve months is an intoxicating thought. With IBM Down, Buy And Sleep Sound Like Buffett, which was published in October 2013, was my single best performing article with 32,355 page views and 3 Telecom ADRs To Consider Before China's Economy Rises was my worst performing article by page views with only 1,028 views."
The Walt Disney Company: World's Largest Company In 2114,Jul.11.14,"As a veteran Wall Street Analyst, it pains me to think how many investors consider 'long term' to be 9-12 months. Actually, I have known many who would generously define 'long term' as 6 months. Such harmful thinking causes investors to be whipsawed by the market - buying and selling at just the wrong moments. What if instead of thinking about an investment horizon in months, we were to take a really long view and consider making an investment for 100 years? If you could buy one stock today and hold it indefinitely for you and your descendants, which one would you pick? This is not meant as purely an abstract exercise, but instead is a method of looking beyond current and obvious trends and finding winners that will ride out the next big depression, war, climactic change or other disaster, all of which will surely arrive.Let's start by looking at the top 20 largest companies today and ask ourselves if they are likely to 1) be in business in 100 years and 2) likely to see continued growth over the next 100 years, come hell or high water. Today, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is by far the largest company by market cap, and there is much to like about Apple and its long-term prospects. The problem is that Apple must stay on the ever slippery slope of technology and continuously improve its products to stay on top. What are the odds that some newer, better, faster, cheaper or superior technology will be invented in the next 10 decades that will supplant Apple's? Probably fairly high. What are the odds that Apple can maintain its 'Mojo' and that a new Steve Jobs (or really several new Steve Jobs) will appear on the horizon to lead the company on to even greater glory? Probably fairly low. I fully expect Apple will still be in business in 100 years, but I doubt it will still be on top. There are too many ways that unforeseen tech market shifts can rapidly erode the base of even such a great company as Apple."
Lenovo Q2 2015 Review: Near-Term Hiccup Presents An Attractive Buying Opportunity,Nov.10.14,"EventLenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) reported slightly disappointing 2Q15 earnings in which revenue was 7% below consensus. Operating profit beat on better cost control and EPS of $0.025 was largely in-line with consensus. The weakness in revenue was due to lower than expected smartphone sale in China on what management said to be an accounting decision to credit a late September sale in fiscal Q3. I view this explanation to be credible and that we could see a higher Q3 smartphone number.Overall, the PC business continues to execute and now accounts for 19.7% of the worldwide PC shipment. Further execution with the integration of IBM x 86 servers could help Lenovo to boost its PC share to 25% in the medium term from corporate cross-selling. Despite this quarter's miss on smartphone, I believe that the acquisition of Motorola significantly strengthened its smartphone business in terms of R&D and distribution channels, and could make Lenovo a material threat to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone in the next decade as Lenovo squeeze Samsung out of the North American market. In short, I continue to view Lenovo's long-term prospect to be attractive. While integration risk is a key concern for Lenovo given the different managerial style and culture, I remain positive given the management's strong track record in previous deals (i.e. NEC JV, Medion, Compal JV etc).HighlightsPC division still solid. Consistent with the prior trend, the PC division continues to see market share gain across all key geographic regions with the exception of the Americas market where market share expansion was flat. Most encouraging, China PC shipments returned to growth for the first time in six quarters and Lenovo continues to be the dominant PC maker with incremental margin improvement due to greater scale. Overall PC sale was up +11% and I expect Lenovo to hold its market share in China while consolidating the ex-China market share. In the medium term, we could see Lenovo PC market share reaching 25% driven by the greater scale from x86 acquisition."
Should You Invest In Hortonworks?,Dec.31.14,"Situation: Hortonworks (NHDP) recently went public at $16 per share. Since then, the stock has risen dramatically to $25 per share as of December 26th. Hortonworks trades at an extremely high valuation at twenty four times sales and no earnings. To its benefit, hortonworks has posted outstanding revenue growth and is operating in an enormous market. Yet, there are numerous risk factors regarding the company's sustainable competitive advantage that are alarming. Overall, we feel Hortonworks is an equity to decline purchasing, given numerous risk factors and an already premium valuation, areas we detail further below.Brief Business Description: The company provides a Hadoop platform to enable organizations to use the power of big data within the enterprise. The product is based on a unique distribution of Apache Hadoop and powered by YARN. YARN is designed as a common data operating system that enables the Hadoop ecosystem to integrate multiple applications, while also allowing consistent security and operations across the platform.Source: Company Investor Presentation5 Key Reasons Why We Are Holding Off Purchasing Shares:Lockup Expiration: The IPO lockup is set to expire June 2015. The pressure of insiders and early investors cashing out could put downward pressure on the stock price. Even if you are a long-term investor in the stock, this event is likely to move the stock lower over the next six months. Large capitalization companies with extensive analyst coverage such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) may have their stock react in mixed ways to lock-ups. However, for small capitalization/emerging growth companies, lock-ups have the potential to dramatically lower the stock price."
Berkshire Hathaway: Worth Its SALT,Aug. 4.14,"Berkshire Hathaway: Worth Its SALTWarren Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, never mention a specific value for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) and (NYSE:BRK.B) but they do give us clues from time to time.Chart 1 below tracks Berkshire's ""Adjusted Munger Value"" quarterly since 1996 based on a simple method Charlie Munger referred to in his 1999 letter to Wesco shareholders. Charlie's method was simply book value plus one fifth of deferred taxes. Munger mentioned that each dollar of book value was much more valuable at Berkshire than a similar dollar at Wesco, but he did not say how much more valuable.Munger explained how deferred tax could be thought of as an interest-free loan from the government that needed to be ""repaid"" only if Wesco sold investments and realized gains. Munger described his method as a guess but he did not explain fully why he thought one fifth was the right proportion.So, Chart 1 tracks Berkshire's book value plus one fifth of float and deferred taxes, and multiplies the result by a premium that gets smaller as Berkshire grows relative to total US GDP. We call the resulting figure ""Adjusted Munger Value"" or AMV.AMV matches pretty well with market price since 1996 showing five periods of over-valuation of 20% or more and five periods of under-valuation of 15% or more.But there are those unanswered questions about how much a dollar of book value is really worth at Berkshire, and how much value accrues to shareholders from float and deferred taxes. So here is another approach."
Conn's Has Been Deemed A Perfect Short,Dec.18.14,"CONN's has been Deemed a Perfect Short (TICKER: CONN)The shares of Conn's, Inc., are a ""Perfect Short"". With the reporting of its most recent disappointing quarter and the resulting 50% decline of its share price and market cap during the week of December 8th, Conn's meets all of the requirements as outlined in my Perfect Short Research criterion.Conn's was founded in 1890 and has approximately 80 retail stores that are primarily located in Texas, Arizona, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. The company sells durable consumer goods including furniture, appliances, electronics and mattresses on credit. Conn's primary customers are minorities and consumers who have no credit or low credit scores.The significant declines for Conn's share price and market capitalization after reporting each of its quarterly results since the beginning of 2014, has been caused its growing volume of consumer credit delinquencies. The considerable downdraft in its market cap and share price has severely restricted Conn's ability to raise equity capital to reduce its burgeoning liabilities, which are being caused by its chronic negative Cash Flow from Operations. Total liabilities increased by approximately 50% from $616 million to $919 million for 10/31/14 as compared to 10/31/13. Negative Cash Flow for Conn's quarter and nine months ending 10/31/14 was $79 million $127 million respectively."
Apple Pay's Advantages Over Google Wallet And PayPal,Sep.11.14,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay might just be the one thing to bring mobile payments to mainstream adoption. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Wallet failed to gain traction among consumers.

Digital River Will Continue To Underperform,Sep.23.14,"Digital River, Inc. (NASDAQ:DRIV) is a provider of ecommerce and payment solutions. Digital River's ecommerce platform is used for digital items such as video games. Over the last several years, Digital River has struggled to grow revenue and margins. From 2009-2013, revenue declined a total of 1.4%. In 2014, revenue has continued to decline. The company's revenue declined 3.1% in Q2 and 7.9% in the first half. Digital River has also suffer from margin compression. In 2013, gross margin was 66.0% which is slightly lower than 2009's 68.5%. Yet, gross margin in 2009 was significantly impacted by the loss of a major customer. The company's gross margin decline has been more severe compare to 2010 (82.2%). Digital River's issues have resulted in a significant decline in their stock.Digital River's stock is trading at significantly low valuation. However, the company is facing significant near-term headwinds with their platform redesign. The redesign will take until 2015 to complete. As Digital River develops their new platform, they will continue to fall behind the competition in the enterprise market. Additionally, Digital River's potential market is limited by their current product offering which isn't suited for certain verticals. The company's customer concentration has increased despite a rough 2009. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has gradually risen as a percentage of revenue. Their significant revenue contribution appears to be helping them suppress Digital River's prices. Currently, Digital River's stock appears to be trading at a significantly low valuation. Yet, the company is facing several challenges in the near and medium term. Digital River hasn't been able to consistently grow revenue. Additionally, they have shown a history of lagging behind competitors and are setup to continue to trail. Although the stock is trading at a low valuation, the company and the stock are positioned to continue to underperform."
Varonis Is The Market Leader In Unstructured Data,Aug.26.14,"Varonis Systems Inc. (VRNS) is a developer of data governance solutions which help manage unstructured data. Over the last few years, management has been drastically increasing both revenue and operating expenses. From 2011-2013, revenue grew at a CAGR of 37.0%. So far in 2014, revenue has grown 38.3%. Revenue has grown fast but operating expenses have grown faster. Sales, marketing, general, and administrative expenses have increased at a CAGR of over 40%. These operating expenses have continued to grow over 40% in 2014. The growth in operating expenses has resulted in larger and larger operating losses. In 2013, the company's operating loss was $5.8 million. So far in 2014, the company has already amassed an operating loss of $12.5 million. Varonis has been growing fast and management believes this growth will continue. This is why management is focusing more on expanding operations than profitability.There are significant data trends which support management's belief in future business growth. The amount of digital data is expected to increase exponentially over the next decade. The vast majority of this data is expected to be unstructured. IT departments will need to be able to better handle this data. Additionally, IT departments will have limited budgets for infrastructure over the next decade. This should represent a great opportunity for an unstructured data solutions provider. Surprisingly, Varonis is considered one of the only companies able to handle this influx of data. This means Varonis should be able to continue its rapid growth except there is one major problem."
Fair Isaac Corp. - My Forever Stock - Would Warren Buffett Invest With A Moat This Wide?,Aug.28.14,"Although the stock has barely moved since I projected it could double in my last article, Fair Isaac Corp. (NYSE:FICO) is still one of the widest moat companies that is publicly traded; they are the creator of the ubiquitous retail credit score which has the company namesake of FICO, and is immaculately run (as I will describe below). Unscathed from the financial crisis, Fair Isaac Corporation has a string of excellent news of late; they just launched a $250mm buyback program (representing 14% of the company!), revenue grew 10% (with software growing at 12-14%, which is the key to future profit growth), and there is always the potential that FICO spins-off their Credit Scores unit to unlock additional shareholder value.FICO Scores is part of the Scores Unit for reporting purposes and provides 26% of the revenue for FICO while contributing 45% to the total operating income for Fair Isaac. With one of the widest moats of any operating company in America and a product as well-known as Michael Jordan or the United States flag internationally, FICO scores displays their pricing power and economic advantage in each annual report. Although revenue in the unit (and the company as a whole) is fairly volatile with unit revenue still below all-time highs in 2006, the whole companies' revenue is highly correlated housing and consumer GDP which makes FICO a Warren Buffett-type bet on American economic recovery. Others have mentioned the historically choppy revenue and earnings as a reason this wouldn't be a company Warren Buffett would be interested in, but if you considered USG, Moody's, BNSF at the time of his first stock purchase, and numerous other companies who have strong business operations but whose operations are levered to certain parts of the economy, preventing them from reporting smooth and steadily increasing earnings. I believe FICO's intrinsic value and earnings power has likely increased at a higher than market rate over a relatively long-term time period. FICO has the #1 or #2 market share in each of their software application categories (See my previous article) and FICO scores has a 96%+ market share for retail credit scores and has held this nearly unthinkable monopoly for almost 3 decades; their long-term stock chart should make any investor drool at the results."
Diabetes: The Global Epidemic Pushing Novo Nordisk Higher,Nov.28.14,"Without a doubt, diabetes is one of the most prevalent and fastest growing diseases in the world. As a consequence, strong patient/drug relationships have developed over time and will continue to intensify with diagnosis, treatment, and life expectancy rates on the rise. Leading diabetes care companies such as Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), and Sanofi (NYSE:SNY) have benefited from this trend, and will continue to see rising profits unless diabetes is magically cured.In this article, I will explore what diabetes is, who has diabetes and what the treatment is. Then, I will take a deep dive into one of my favorite companies, Novo Nordisk, and explain why you should buy and hold it forever. Novo has dominated the diabetes market, and has seen massive revenue growth and margin enhancement over the past decade. They have also crushed the S&P 500 over the last 10-, 20- and 30-year periods.What Is Diabetes?In a normal functioning human body, glucose (sugar) is converted to energy by a chemical called insulin that is produced by the pancreas. In certain individuals, this process is impaired and the pancreas fails to create a sufficient quantity of insulin. This condition is known as diabetes and is a long-term disease that can require life-long treatment.There are two main types of diabetes: type I and type 2. Type 1 diabetes (which accounts for approximately 10% of diagnoses) is when the body produces no insulin. It occurs most frequently in children, is usually caused by genetics, and requires insulin injections for the rest of one's life. Type 2 diabetes, which is much more common (accounts for approximately 90% of diagnoses) is when the body does not produce enough insulin. It primarily affects adults, has a strong correlation to physical inactivity and obesity, and usually requires patients to take insulin in tablet form. The third type of diabetes, which is much less common, is gestational diabetes, which affects females during pregnancy."
What You Need To Know About Basel III,"Sep. 13, 2014 1:15 PM ET","[Originally published on 7/11/2014]What You Need to Know About Basel IIIFirst, Basel III is rather an extension of Basel II, which at its core is a mechanism that tests the ability of banks to withstand assets (i.e. loans) loses in a stress/crises scenario. It evaluates the risk of default for each loan by using probability of default. It uses the Single Risk Factor model (single since it depends on a single factor, the economic growth/decline variable) i.e. one variable (X- the economy) that predict whether or not a bank would default in a stress scenario. The variable is a correlation variable to the economic activity. The higher the correlation is, the higher the probability of default would be in a crises scenario.The single risk factor is asymptotic since it only holds if the bank holds a large portfolio of loans. To determine the credit risk distribution of a portfolio of loans, we need the probability of default (determined by the issuing bank) and the correlation factor to the overall economy. Based on the loan loss distribution, the bank can determine the maximum losses, setting aside capital that exactly matches that maximum expected loss.How we determine the correlation factor?Prior to the crises, banks would use a return variable (i.e. the equity return on a blue-chip local company e.g. IBM), multiply it by a stock market index and then run a regression to estimate the correlation factor. The caveat is that banks would have to put a lot of faith in the fact that the factor return they observe in the stock market applies to credit risk. Banks would re-run a Monte-Carlo simulation for the loan portfolio and then they will compare the results with the Basel check formula."
Berkshire Hathaway - Building Earnings Power,Jun.11.14,"We attended the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) annual meeting held on May 3, 2014 in Omaha along with a record crowd of about 40,000 other folks from around the globe who gathered once again for the Woodstock for Capitalists. Warren Buffett, Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, and Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman, answered questions from shareholders, analysts and the media. Here are a few highlights from the meeting.First Quarter ResultsWarren Buffett began the meeting with a brief recap of Berkshire Hathaway's first quarter financial results with operating earnings down 7% and net income down 4% (see our detailed first quarter analysis for Berkshire Hathaway on our website). Book value increased 2.6% from year end to $138,426 per A share. Insurance float as of 3/31/14 was approximately $78 billion. Buffett noted that the $78 billion in float was his to invest and that the underwriting profits were satisfactory in the first quarter. He added, ""The insurance business is marvelous!""Dividend ProposalThe proxy this year included a shareholder proposal for Berkshire to pay a ""meaningful"" dividend. ""Whereas the corporation has more money than it needs, and since the owners unlike [Warren Buffett] are not multibillionaires, the board shall consider paying a meaningful annual dividend on the shares,"" the proposal stated. The proposal was soundly defeated by shareholders. Buffett marveled that by a vote of 45 to 1, Berkshire shareholders said, ""Don't pay us a dividend."" Shareholders believe Buffett can create much more value by reinvesting the bountiful cash Berkshire generates than by distributing it as a dividend."
Avnet's Growth Through Acquisitions Provides Good Value To Investors,Jul. 3.14,"Avnet Inc. (NYSE:AVT) is a provider of electronics related components, products, services and solutions. Its operations are divided into two groups, Electronics Marketing, which accounts for 59.3% of sales or $15.1 billion and Technology Solutions, which accounts for the remaining 40.7% of sales or $10.36 billion. These two operating groups have customers in over 80 countries. The Electronics Marketing group sells semiconductors, embedded products, which are computers that operate within a larger system, along with interconnect, passive and electromechanical devices. Electronics Marketing also offers many value-added products and services to help customers shorten the time to market of their products and eliminate costly inefficiencies. This group's customers are companies in almost every sector and range from medical equipment companies to industrial and manufacturing companies.As its name suggests, Avnet's Technology Solutions group provides server, software, IT, systems, datacenter and cloud solutions and services primarily to technology manufacturers. Many of Technology Solutions' customers are in the original equipment manufacturing computer technology market but it also serves value-added resellers, system integrators and independent software vendors. This operating group of Avnet is known for its SolutionsPath® methodology with which Avnet provides many value-added services specifically to help companies working to expand in vertical and high-growth markets.Over the last five years, Avnet has acquired 40 companies, which has helped it boost revenue from $16.2 billion in 2009 to $25.5 billion in 2013. One of Avnet's largest recent acquisitions was MSC Group, a European distributor of electronic components, embedded computing, and display solutions. Avnet acquired it in the second half of 2013. In 2012, MSC Group had revenue of over $450 million. Since this acquisition, Avnet has integrated MSC Group into the rest of its European, Middle Eastern and African Electronics Marketing operations and in 2014 Avnet CEO, Rick Hamada, announced that Avnet is working to market MSC Group's offerings across Avnet's entire customer base. Avnet applies this approach to many of its acquisitions and uses its large customer base, reputation, and marketing and sales resources to grow the businesses of its subsidiaries."
Why IBM's P/E Ratio Means Nothing For Investors,Mar.16.15,"The investment debate between IBM (NYSE:IBM) bears and bulls is quite easy to summarize. Bears emphasize three consecutive years of revenue declines and lost market share, while bulls simply point to the P/E ratio and say, ""IBM trades at just 9x next year's earnings minus cash."" In essence, IBM's P/E ratio is the classic defense that gives the illusion that IBM cannot possibly fall much lower, and is already priced for a worst case scenario.However, IBM's low P/E ratio is only possible because the company has reduced its share count to the tune of 23% in five years; reducing share count will naturally drive a company's earnings per share higher, or at least keep it stable. That's why IBM's P/E ratio is essentially meaningless as a reflection of its valuation, and its free cash flow is a much better metric to analyze the stock.A company's EPS can be entirely influenced by its buyback activity, like IBM. However, free cash flow cannot be influenced, or made to look better than it really is. FCF is how much money a company earns minus CapEx, and in 2014, IBM's FCF declined 18% to $12.37 billion. That said, take a look at the chart below, which should provide a very good illustration of IBM's stock value at this moment.Unlike the stock price and P/E ratio, IBM's market capitalization and FCF has not been influenced by buybacks. Its market capitalization (and enterprise value) is a true reflection of the company's worth while FCF represents the underlying performance of its business. What's truly amazing to me is that IBM's trailing 12-month free cash flow has declined much faster than its market capitalization. As a result, IBM is actually more expensive today than it was five years ago based on its price/FCF ratio."
IBM: A Discounted Way To Gain International Exposure,May.26.15,"""You know, there's nothing you can do about your public image. It is what it is. I just try to do things honestly.

"15 Years After Bubble Burst, Tech Stocks Competitively Priced","Mar. 9, 2015 6:03 PM ET","With the Nasdaq composite recently regaining the 5000 mark and with the 15-year anniversary of the Nasdaq's all-time high of 5,048 on March 9, headlines have revolved around how the technology space has changed. Some have even stated that the recent run-up in stock prices puts the technology space in a bigger bubble than in 2000. Despite what many are saying, the current environment does not suggest an impending bubble burst based on key financial metrics.Y2K Tech StocksTaking a look at seven companies that were operating in 2000 and are still around today sheds light on how the space has changed. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) were selected for comparison.

IBM Services Versus Accenture: A By The Numbers Comparison,May.29.15,"The purpose of this article is to do a preliminary comparison of the financial metrics of Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and IBM's (NYSE:IBM) Services segment, and to draw some subsequent inferences about the current market valuations of both companies.At the very outset two caveats need to be pointed out:Accenture is primarily a systems integration, consulting and outsourcing company. IBM Services provides a much broader range of services. That is, the comparison is not quite apples to apples. Regardless, Accenture is the closest ""peer"" to IBM's Services business.The discussion below simply considers some historical metrics. In doing any sort of serious valuation (which by definition is forward looking) it would be necessary to have a qualitative discussion of the landscape of the industry and competitive advantages/economics of these services businesses. This is not done in this article.Accenture vs. IBM ServicesAll the information below is sourced from the companies' SEC filings. All dollar amounts below are in billions.Accenture2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007Revenue 31.8 30.4 29.8 27.4 23.1 23.2 25.3 21.5Pre-tax income 4.3 4.3 3.9 3.5 2.9 2.7 3 2.5Pre-tax margin 13.5% 14.1% 13.1% 12.8% 12.6% 11.6% 11.9% 11.6%IBM Services segment2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007Revenue 56.4 58.7 60.7 62.1 58.5 57.2 61.5 56.9Pre-tax income 9.2 10.1 9.8 9.3 8 8 7.3 5.5Pre-tax margin 16.3% 17.2% 16.1% 14.9% 13.7% 13.9% 11.9% 9.8%On a purely numerical basis, I believe the comparison between Accenture and IBM's services segment is tough. IBM has a much higher margin business, but in recent years growth has been non-existent. Accenture on the other hand doesn't have as wide margins, but has shown the ability to grow in recent years.If one is to assume that Accenture will be able to grow over the next 5 years at rates similar to or greater than the past 5, then its current market capitalization of $64 billion (about 15x pre-tax income) seems reasonable/rational. I would assert that at its current valuation Accenture is efficiently priced by the market."
IBM 2014 Cash Flow Analysis,Jan.21.15,"Just like I did for the past two years, I will present a few articles over the next few weeks with detailed analysis of IBM's (NYSE:IBM) cash flow and revenue.For more information on my method, please refer to my article from last year. (You can find all my IBM coverage HERE.)The following is the cash flow statement provided by IBM in its Q4 earnings presentation:As always, I will try to calculate IBM's Owner Earnings. In his 1986 Letter to Berkshire Shareholders Buffett explains that Owner Earnings represent:Reported earnings plus depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash chargesLESSthe average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume.According to Mr. Buffett's definition, we should take net income (first line: $12) and add depreciation and amortization (line 2: $4.5).What shall we do with stock-based compensation? The corresponding note in the last annual report explains that:Stock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock based awards granted to employees. The company measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognizes the cost on a straight-line basis (net of estimated forfeitures) over the employee requisite service period. The company estimates the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes valuation model."
"Should Visa, MasterCard Fear IBM?",Mar.20.15,"Last week, Reuters broke news that IBM (NYSE:IBM) was working on adopting bitcoin technology to potentially develop a form of digital cash for a payments system. The details are sketchy at this point, but the news should give pause to a few high-priced stocks in the payments processing sector.While on the surface it doesn't appear logical or much of a threat for a stumbling technology giant to enter the payments arena, the reality is that it highlights the major themes that concern investing in Visa (NASDAQ:VA) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA). With the major concern for the payment processors that digital cash could connect a recent partner of IBM that just happens to be at the forefront of mobile payments in the form of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).The key to this thesis is that whether or not IBM succeeds or even moves forward with this digital payments system is not the major concern for Visa and MasterCard. The reason that even a laggard like IBM is looking at such a system exists for a few prime reasons that should give every investor in these two payment processors a reason to pause.The TechnologyAccording to the report, IBM is looking at using the blockchain technology behind bitcoin to create a digital cash and payment system for major currencies such as the U.S. Dollar, Euro, and Japanese Yen. For people not familiar with bitcoin, it was created as a digital currency to replace existing currencies and avoid the high costs of existing payment processing networks such as Visa and MasterCard. Some of the other benefits of bitcoin and other digital currencies include privacy, security and speed. Interested parties can read more about it at bitcoin.org."
Warren Buffett Increases Berkshire Hathaway's Stake In IBM - Let's Analyze It,Mar.30.15,"In reviewing the latest 13-F Filing results for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) on the website Whale Wisdom, I discovered this:This was quite surprising as IBM (NYSE:IBM) is having trouble finding many Wall Street Analysts who are recommending it as a buy at the moment, mainly due to its negative revenue growth.So what does Warren Buffett see that so many on Wall Street do not? What has him investing so much more in a company that his company already has such a very large stake in?In preparing for this article, I found this interesting video of Mr. Buffett actually explaining why he continues to buy more IBM.Warren Buffett InterviewClearly, this video demonstrates that Mr. Buffett may not have the same objectives in buying IBM as those who have blindly followed him into it, without doing their own due diligence. These investors are probably not very happy right now, as the chart below shows."
What The Whisper Number Indicates For IBM Earnings,Jan.20.15,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) reports earnings after the bell Tuesday, January 20th. The whisper number is $5.42, in-line with the analysts' estimate and showing neutral confidence from the WhisperNumber community. Whispers range from a low of $5.20 to a high of $5.60. IBM has a 67% positive surprise history (having topped the whisper in 40 of the 60 earnings reports for which we have data).Earnings history:- Beat whisper: 40 qtrs- Met whisper: 1 qtrs- Missed whisper: 19 qtrsOur primary focus is on post earnings price movement. Knowing how likely a stock's price will move following an earnings report can help you determine the best action to take (long or short). In other words, we analyze what happens when the company beats or misses the whisper number expectation.The table below indicates the average post earnings price movement within a one and thirty trading day timeframe:The strongest price movement of +1% comes within twenty trading days when the company reports earnings that beat the whisper number, and +2.3% within thirty trading days when the company reports earnings that miss the whisper number. The overall average post earnings price move is 'positive' (beat the whisper number and see strength, miss and see strength) when the company reports earnings.The table below indicates the most recent earnings reports and short-term price reaction:"
IBM Cloud Becoming A Major Enterprise Player: Big Blue Nabs Major Deal With U.S. Army,Apr.14.15,"IBM (NYSE: IBM) has been having big cloud ambitions for a number of years. But in a market that's already crowded with names such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), VMware (NYSE: VMW), Rackspace (NYSE:RAX), Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) and others, Big Blue has not seen easy sailing.IBM has been trying to differentiate its cloud from those by competitors by using its deep expertise in big data and analytics in its cloud offerings, and this seems to be working. The company made a major cloud announcement barely two weeks ago when the company said that it plans to spend $3 billion to build out an IoT Analytics cloud over the next four years. Now news has emerged that the U.S. Army has shifted its logistics data to IBM's hybrid cloud. The logistics systems of the U.S. Army, also known as LOGSA, processes more than 40 million transactions a day. LOGSA has been working with IBM since 2012. LOGSA shifted its data to IBM's hybrid cloud over the course of last year and added a layer of business analytics to the original deal. The release did not divulge any details regarding the value of the LOGSA contract, but said that the business analytics deal was a $60-million addendum to the original contract. By shifting its data to the cloud, the Army is looking to achieve 50% cost-savings. IBM claims that the LOGSA cloud will be bigger than the New York Stock Exchange.Business Analytics is the main differentiator for IBM's CloudThe ''Big 3'' clouds - AWS from Amazon, Azure and IBM's cloud - each offer a different value proposition to their customers. For Big Blue, big data and analytics is now becoming a major selling point for enterprise customers. Big Blue has traditionally lagged its more illustrious cloud players mainly due to the first-mover advantage enjoyed by AWS and Azure."
IBM: Executive Compensation At Big Blue,Apr.28.15,"The long-term returns from an investment in a company (via common stock) is essentially determined by three factors:The underlying economic characteristics of the business and the industry it operates in.The price paid relative to intrinsic value.Management's stewardship of capital.It is often easier to evaluate No. 1 and No. 2, since these factors lend themselves to numerical and objective analysis. Consequently, in determining whether a common stock is an attractive investment, No. 3 is often not emphasized as much.Regardless, No. 3 is incredibly important for long term results. After all, one could invest in a business that churns out cash day in and day out but if management simply burns this in a pile, then a minority shareholder's returns will most likely be dismal.There are some objective measures one can use to evaluate management - returns on capital, operating efficiency, etc. However, it can be difficult to separate managerial effects from the underlying characteristics of the business - there are some businesses a ham sandwich could run and there are businesses which implode even though they are being run by very talented and responsible people.The purpose of this article is to try to get a handle on the (for want of a better word) character of senior management at IBM (NYSE:IBM) by using available data on executive compensation.Let me warn the reader that any conclusions that one might draw from such data are necessarily extremely subjective and riddled with biases.Regardless, I hope that the reader will agree that excessive compensation is a red flag, and reasonable compensation is a good sign that management is focused on the company rather than their short-term paychecks.Let's start with some facts.Fact 1: Options-based compensation at IBM.The usual way for management at a company to unfairly enrich itself via stock is through options-based compensation. Options can be used to provide management with lottery tickets (if the stock goes up, management wins big, if it goes down they don't lose much). For a quick primer on this see Warren Buffett's 2005 letter to shareholders (see page 16 of the letter)."
Ranking The Dow Jones Industrial Stocks With The Chowder Rule,"Mar. 30, 2015 5:03 PM ET","Last year, I wrote an article on how the Dow Jones Industrial stocks would compare based on the ""Chowder Rule."" You can find that article here. This article is an update looking at the Chowder Rule again and the index, along with some new insights and opinions.What is the Chowder Rule?The ""Chowder Rule"" is a bit of an institution among Seeking Alpha followers. It's a process formed by, yes you guessed it, Chowder. This rule was created to help decide which companies' stocks to invest in. Chowder himself dubs it, ""The Success Formula That Never Fails.""This process can help you identify the best dividend growth companies. It enables you to compare high yield/low dividend growth stocks vs. low yield/high dividend growth stocks.The First StepFirst thing's first, each company must have investment grade credit. Chowder wants to see a BBB+ rating by Morningstar or a Quality rating of B+ or better from S& Capital IQ. If you use Value Line, check for a safety rating of 1 or 2. You can read more about the research process at, ""It's All About the Fundamentals"".What's considered high yield?First you need the S&P 500's yield. Currently, its yield is 1.89%. If a stock yield is 50% higher than the S&P 500's yield, it's considered ""high yield."" That would mean a current yield of 2.84% would be considered ""high."" For this exercise, let's make it easy and round up to 3.0%.How do you get a Chowder score?The rule is quite simple. You first take the current yield of a stock and its 5-year dividend compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). Add these two numbers together and that gives you its ""score.""A Chowder score of 12 or greater is required when the current dividend yield is 3.00% or greater. If the current dividend yield is less than 3.00%, it must have a score of 15 or higher. Using this scoring system, you may invest in a lower yielding stock if it has higher dividend growth rate to compensate for the lower current income."
IBM's OpenPOWER Foundation: What Is It And Does It Matter?,Jan.26.15,"With the continuing sales of consumption devices like tablets and smartphones, demand is increasing for the servers that feed them. The current consensus is that high-end enterprise type servers are a stable market, not a growth market, while the mid-range and low-end servers will continue to grow. While Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)-based servers have taken the lion's share of the server market in the past several years, competition is intensifying as Intel's last two processors failed to improve top-end performance considerably, while focusing more on performance at lower wattages. Many look to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) as a potential competitor with its Zen and K12 releases in 2016, or pay attention to Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) intentions in the server market with interest. While it is important to never discount companies, one has failed to have a competitive server processor for nearly a decade, the other has no experience developing this class of processors.A company that already has a processor with significantly greater performance than Intel's, is IBM (NYSE:IBM), and its POWER8 line. Many like to think of Intel as a top-shelf provider of server hardware, whereas it's really more of a mid-range brand that falls short of IBM at the highest end of the segment. IBM has historically been very proprietary with its line of processors, while Intel has been more open, and less expensive, while still offering good enough performance for many scenarios. For IBM to gain greater adoption for the POWER line of processors, it has to leverage its superiority in security, performance and scalability, while eliminating the previous impediments to POWER adoption. The OpenPOWER initiative is this attempt, and offers far greater performance, while being more open than the x86 platform. But, where the price falls is an important consideration we have yet to see, although Tyan's reference platform appears to be reasonable at $2700."
IBM To Acquire Explorys And Phytel To Boost Its Healthcare Analytics Technology,"Apr. 17, 2015 6:52 AM ET","IBM announced on Tuesday that it has acquired two healthcare technology startups Explorys and Phytel to complement its existing Big Data analytics technology in healthcare.International Business Machines Corporation is emphasizing more on healthcare in order to add more in its current abilities of healthcare tech. on Tuesday, the big blue company declared the acquisition of 2 health tech companies Phytel and Explorys, which are internationally known analytics and Big Data firms that offers health services. However, the details of the acquisition were not disclosed.According to International Business Machine press release, ""The acquisitions bolster IBM's efforts to apply advanced analytics and cognitive computing to help primary care providers, large hospital systems and physician networks improve healthcare quality and effect healthier patient outcomes.""Explorys is a company based in Cleveland, which came into existence followed by a spinoff in 2009 by Cleveland Clinic. It is basically a platform that gathers several kinds of data including financial, clinical and operational. The cloud computing service of the company supports various healthcare platforms to utilize its data in order to find out different diseases its treatments and outcomes. Explorys gathers more than 315 billion data elements, more than 50 million patients and approximately 360 hospitals. Earlier last week, analysis, market researches and IDC named Explorys as the international leading healthcare financial and clinical analytics. The firm was amongst the twelve Big Data healthcare platforms in report of IDC.Phytel is headquartered in Dallas; it offers cloud based services and health technology to providers of healthcare and doctors. It makes sure that the treatment provided to the patient is effective and according to the healthcare standards. It uses the technology of cutting edge to recognize and notify patients, who require treatment, though measuring quality, obedience and financial outcomes.Furthermore, IBM said, it is planning to launch a cloud service, Watson Health Cloud, which will be a safe platform for researchers, insurers and doctors compared to others, who are involved in establishing solutions for healthcare. The big blue is also joining hands with Apple Inc., Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson to ""help optimize consumer and medical devices for data collection, analysis and feedback.""Earlier last month, the United States high-tech firm, IBM disclosed the acquisition of AlchemyAPI, which offers ""scalable cognitive computing"" and profound learning technology. The big blue also bought some assets from Blekko, which offers web crawling services.IBM stock was down by 0.05 and stood at $162.30 at market close on Tuesday, went up by 0.01% during pre-market session and reached $162.31. the Armonk based company has 160.50 billion of market capitalization and 10.31x price to earnings ratio."
Govcoin? IBM And Intel Flirt With The Blockchain,Mar.20.15,"As a Bitcoin (Pending:COIN) enthusiast I follow all of the news related to the cryptocurrency. I have done two previous articles where I've made stock indexes as a way to profit off of the adoption of Bitcoin as well as to track it in an innovative way. I will be updating that index in a future article.In this article I focus on the news about how IBM and the Federal Reserve are working on an alternative to Bitcoin. My initial reaction was excitement, but it quickly subdued as I looked into it more closely. I will give you my analysis of the situation and how it affects Bitcoin and IBM (NYSE:IBM). After this news came out another story was released that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was also working on a Bitcoin alternative, so I'll review that as well. I will also look at how Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay and Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger payment service will be disrupted by Bitcoin in the long term.I have seen a few articles on Bitcoin on Seeking Alpha which state the currency will never amount to anything. These writers likely are not involved with Bitcoin at all. While I would not consider myself an expert on the matter, I think I will be able to provide you with a more balanced discussion.The reason why I got excited initially after I read these headlines is the Federal Government, IBM and Intel were finally recognizing the game-changing technology Bitcoin represents. This is a compliment to the mathematics surrounding it as well as the potential for further expansion. After looking at it more closely it seems as though IBM isn't enthralled with the decentralized nature of the currency. It is trying to create a centralized government Bitcoin. As others have, I'll call it Govcoin. The basic idea that I gleaned from the story is that IBM wants to use the blockchain and ignore Bitcoin. I'll explain what the blockchain is for those who aren't familiar with Bitcoin."
Verizon And Amazon.com Have This One Thing In Common,May.26.15,"Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) are companies that seemingly have nothing in common. One operates on mobile networks, the other is popular on mobile networks. One is a cash cow, the other can't seem to produce consistent profits. Yet despite their differences, there's one thing that both companies share.That thing is innovation, getting ahead of major industries to command enormous market share. For Amazon.com, I am talking about cloud infrastructure services, and its near 30% share of a market with trailing 12-month revenue of $17 billion, one that's growing at a 45% rate, according to Synergy Research.Amazon.com is leaps and bounds ahead of its competitors. Microsoft holds the No. 2 position with a 10% share, followed by IBM and Google with 7% and 6% of the market, respectively. Just last week Gartner released its Magic Quadrant report for the cloud space. It reported that Amazon.com's AWS had 10 times more infrastructure-as-a-service computing capacity than the combined capacity of the following 14 service providers. Gartner concludes that AWS has been able to attract the largest customer base because of its capacity, and that Amazon.com has the most diverse collection of infrastructure and platform cloud service arrays of any competitor.Amazon.com has managed to establish this enormous lead over the cloud infrastructure services market, with superior products, because it entered the space before it was actually an industry. AWS was the first in its class, and Amazon.com has made very big bets on the cloud and data centers while competitors are left playing catch up. Therein lies the similarity between Verizon and Amazon.com.Likewise, Verizon sported North America's largest 4G LTE mobile network for many years, along with the most diversified collection of spectrum assets. This large coverage area on a network that was 10x faster than legacy 3G networks gave Verizon a leading edge over the likes of AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint as smartphones grew more advanced and subscribers used their mobile devices as a substitute for PCs."
BlackBerry's Latest Device Is A Samsung Tablet,Mar.16.15,"CEO John Chen understands BlackBerry (BBRY) strengths and is moving to take advantage of them. Having abandoned the tablet space after the disastrous launch of the BlackBerry Playbook, BlackBerry is now present in tablets again but not in its own devices.Instead, it is hitching its wagon to the fast running horse of Samsung's excellent Galaxy tablets by supplying its SecurSmart technology to Samsung to produce a Samsung enterprise tablet with BlackBerry grade security incorporating some additional features provided by IBM (NYSE:IBM) who is providing the secure application wrapping for the device, labeled SecuTablet.Source: CrackBerry.comThe device is targeted at government and institutional customers to permit them to access financial and budgetary data while on the road, something currently prohibited with competing devices.The collaboration with IBM suggests there is nothing exclusive about its cooperation with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to provide applications for the iPad, which should be no surprise to anyone since for IBM to have any meaningful reach with its applications it needs to address all platforms and in particular Android with its massive user base and Windows with its grip on enterprise.Security is an increasingly important feature of mobile communications and in the headlines recently after the world learned that low technology hackers had no trouble exploiting holes in the Apple Pay system to perpetrate frauds that some reports suggest amounted to 6% of all Apple Pay transactions."
The Aging Of The Tech Sector: The Pricing Divergence Of Young And Old Tech Companies,"Feb. 26, 2015 5:13 PM ET","As the Nasdaq approaches historic highs, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) market cap exceeds that of the Bovespa (the Brazilian equity index) and young social media companies like Snapchat have nosebleed valuations, there's talk of a tech bubble again. It is human nature to group or classify individuals or entities and assign common characteristics to the group and we tend to do the same when investing. Specifically, we categorize stocks into sectors or groups and assume that many or most stocks in each group share commonalities. Thus, we assume that utility stocks have little growth and pay large dividends and commodity and cyclical stocks have volatile earnings largely because of macroeconomic factors. With ""tech"" stocks, the common characteristics that come to mind for many investors are high growth, high risk and low cash payout. While that would have been true for the typical tech stock in the 1980s, is it still true? More specifically, what does the typical tech company look like, how is it priced and is its pricing put it in a bubble? As I hope to argue in the section below, the answers depend upon which segment of the tech sector you look at.A Short History of Tech StocksMy first foray into investing was in the early 1980s as the market started its long bull market run that lasted for almost two decades. In 1981, the technology stocks in the market were mainframe computer manufacturers led by IBM (NYSE:IBM) and a group of smaller companies lumped together as the seven dwarves (Burroughs, Univac, NCR (NYSE:NCR), Honeywell (NYSE:HON), etc.). Not only were they collectively a small proportion of the entire market, but of the list of top 10 companies, in market capitalization terms, in 1981, only one - IBM - could have been categorized as a technology stock (though GE (NYSE:GE) had a small stake in computer-related businesses then):There are two things to note in this graph.Note that 341 technology companies have been in existence for more than 35 years and an additional 427 firms have been in existence between 25 and 35 years, and they collectively comprise about 41% of the firms that had found available in the database. While being in existence more than 25 years may sound unexceptional, given that there are manufacturing and consumer product companies that have been around a century or longer, tech companies age in dog years, as the life cycles tend to be more intense and compressed. Put differently, IBM may not be as old as Coca-Cola in calendar time but it is a corporate in tech years."
"How We Decide Which DGI Stocks Are Core, Supporting And Auxiliary Holdings","May 29, 2015 3:05 PM ET","A couple of months ago, in a Seeking Alpha article entitled, The Dividend House Portfolio: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, I discussed our DGI retirement portfolio. In that piece, I revealed that we classify each of our DGI investments as either a core stock, supporting player, auxiliary holding or on ""the bench."" While I didn't go into detail about how a stock lands in a particular category, I did state the basic concept -- each stock's categorization depends upon our level of confidence in that stock's ability to continue growing its dividend at an attractive pace into the future.As I explained in an exchange with the venerable Chowder here, in my opinion, a stock portfolio for retirees, near-retirees (like my husband and me) and dedicated DGIers (of any age!) can be comprised of dividend stocks with core positions making up the foundation, supporting players holding up the walls and auxiliary positions on the roof.There are two additional categories of note. From time to time, you may lose confidence in a stock and place it ""on the bench"" to monitor it to see if it earns a continuing place in your portfolio. And for those of you with room in your portfolio (and the inclination!) for speculative stocks, I'd place those in the garden where they can bloom. But I don't include ""bench"" stocks or speculative holdings as part of the structure that protects me from the elements. I stick them in the yard to see if they can weather the storms before I take shelter in them!"
QQQ Is A Good Long-Term Investment,May.26.15,"By Jay SmithTechnology is becoming a bigger part of people's lives than ever before. Desktop computers are on every desk. Billions of people around the world have smartphones. Billions more are connected through social media. Because tech is thriving, Nasdaq once again trades above 5,000 - the last round number that the index achieved before the internet bubble burst.In some ways, this time is different from the '90s. While many tech companies still rally 50-100% during their IPOs, tech blue chips don't trade at inflated values like Yahoo (YHOO) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) did in the '90s. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the largest component of the Nasdaq, trades at a forward P/E of 13.74. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) trades at a forward P/E of 17, while internet search giant Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) trades at a forward P/E of just 16.57. Because the blue chips trade at cheap valuations, Nasdaq does not trade at an overinflated valuation like it did in the '90s. The P/E of the PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF is just 20.5, similar to the S&P 500's (NYSEARCA:SPY) P/E ratio of 20.81.Because the fundamentals in technology are better, even savvy investors who stayed out of tech stocks during the last tech bubble are investing in tech. Warren Buffett, who famously said that he didn't understand tech stocks in the last cycle, has a large position in IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM). For Buffett, Big Blue is undervalued given its wide moat, high ROE, and its forward P/E of just 10.5. Like Buffett, Carl Icahn has also invested in tech companies, having invested in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN), Apple, and Lyft in this cycle. Netflix and Apple have so far been big winners for Icahn, making the activist investor billions of dollars in profits. If Apple hits Icahn's $240 per share price target, he could make billions more."
How Berkshire Hathaway's Todd Combs And Ted Weschler Performed Relative To The S&P 500 In 2014,Jan. 6.15,"The S&P 500 rose 11.4% in 2014, with a total return (including dividends) of 13.7%. After outperforming the S&P 500, and Warren Buffett in both 2012 and 2013, did Todd Combs and Ted Weschler outperform the S&P 500 in 2014?From quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Berkshire's portfolio of U.S.-based equities is available through September 30, 2014. The 13F for the quarter ending December 31, 2014, will likely be filed on February 14, 2015. Mr. Buffett has said that the small positions in Berkshire's portfolio are very likely the investments made by Mr. Combs or Mr. Weschler, while the larger ones are his. For example, since the arrival of Mr. Combs and Mr. Weschler, Mr. Buffett has acknowledged investment in International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) with a year-end 2014 market value of $11 billion.By examining Berkshire's recent 13F filings through September 30, 2014, I have identified 16 stocks that are highly likely to be investments of Mr. Combs and Mr. Weschler and were acquired since their arrival at Berkshire Hathaway. Since these positions have been relatively stable through the first nine months of 2014, I am assuming they remained the same as of December 31.DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV), DaVita (NYSE: DVA), and Liberty Media (NASDAQ: LMCA) were among Mr. Weschler's largest holdings in his hedge fund, Peninsula Capital, and MasterCard (NYSE: MA) was one of Mr. Combs' investments in his hedge fund, Castle Point Capital, prior to their joining Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Buffett previously mentioned that his portfolio managers had invested in DirecTV and General Motors (NYSE: GM).Mr. Combs and Mr. Weschler are each managing about $7.5 billion of the $120 billion equity portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B). Their largest investments, DirecTV (+25.5%) and DaVita (+19.5%), performed very well in 2014. DTV (Combs and Weschler) and DVA (Weschler) are each currently valued at more than $2.5 billion."
Intel Versus Qualcomm: Who's The Chip Champ Going Forward?,Apr.13.15,"OverviewFor decades Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been the heavyweight champion of the computer CPU market. Starting with the IBM (NYSE:IBM) PC and continuing through today Intel has dominated what I call the ""immobile"" market and has an enviable record of vanquishing competitors such as AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). But in the new world of mobile new competitors have shown up and in some cases have vanquished the previous indomitable champion. Perhaps the most competitive has been Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).In this article I compare Intel with Qualcomm and see if the capo di capo of the CPU neighborhood will still be the dominate player going forward.A champion is someone who gets up when he can't.-Jack DempseyGrowth markets versus stagnant marketsQualcomm's concentration on mobile markets puts it in the most dynamic and fastest growing chip markets. Its Snapdragon line of ARM chips commands the mobile phone market with over 1 billion android phones shipped with Snapdragon. It also dominates the LTE modem business a market where Intel has only a 1% share.Intel on the other hand recently announced that Q1 sales would be down approximately $1B because of ""weaker than expected demand for business desktop PCs and lower than expected inventory levels across the PC supply chain"" For Intel, desktop CPU's represent the largest and most profitable product line roughly 62% of sales ($35B of $56B total) and 66% of Operating profit. If you include Intel's mobile chip ""contra-revenue"" fiasco it's an even higher percentage. So when the PC Client Group sneezes Intel gets pneumonia. Thus Intel is overly dependent on the stagnant market for desktop PC's."
Want Value? Buy 'Old Tech',"Apr. 20, 2015 8:40 AM ET","Ah, how things have changed since I started writing on SA 3 years ago. Fear is gone. Some prominent news outlets such as CNN and Business Insider, warn that euphoria (and subsequently a downdraft) are upon us in the not so distant future. Even if you're dismissive of all this as scare-mongering, the PE ratio chart below should give you pause, as it suggests a return of the stock market to pre-crash levels.Figure 1. (Shiller - cycle adjusted) PE Ratio TrendsLow Interest Rates, Low Growth Horizon. While the days of zero interest rates are numbered, the collective wisdom is that rates will remain historically low for some time to come (see Figure 2 below). This opinion has come from no less a personage than Ben Bernanke, and he has now been hired by a hedge fund, to help them navigate this low growth future. This prognostication shouldn't make bond investors too comfortable, as even a 1% gyration in interest rates within the 'low interest rate collar' can wipe 1-2 years of return from their portfolios. So if not bonds, and if not a broad basket of (now overvalued) stocks, then what? In the rest of this article, I argue that the answer is stocks. But, in particular, 'Old' Technology stocks!"
The Shocking Truth About Share Buybacks,"May 7, 2015 1:27 AM ET","IntroductionThe value and benefits, or lack thereof, of share buybacks to the future fortunes of a company and its shareholders is one of the most hotly debated subjects on popular financial blogs such as Seeking Alpha. Unfortunately, at least based on my own personal experience, most of the arguments are predicated on opinions and beliefs in lieu of the facts.Consequently, the primary thesis behind this article is to provide a more fact-based discussion regarding the desirability of share buybacks devoid of emotional or opinionated arguments. Stated more directly, my objective will be to answer the question posed in the title of this article: To buy back shares or to not buy back shares, that is the question.My Inspiration Was Not Positively InstigatedMy inspiration for penning this article, which I feel was long overdue, came as a result of a loyal reader of my work sharing a rather one-sided, prejudiced and opinionated article on share buybacks that he/she read on Morningstar Advisor. The article was authored by Rex Nutting of MarketWatch on April 24, 2015, with the provocative title ""Update: How the Stock Market Destroyed the Middle Class."" From my perspective, this article represents a classic example of an opinionated and prejudiced argument lacking a factual representation, as evidenced by the following provoking excerpt:""But one under-appreciated factor is a pervasive business model that encourages top managers of American corporations to loot their company for short-term gains, depriving those companies of the funds they need to build and enlarge, and invest in their workers for the long haul.How do they loot their company? By using large stock buybacks to manage the short-term objectives that trigger higher compensation for themselves. By using those stock buybacks to manipulate the share price, which allows them to use inside information to time their own stock sales.

Today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma’am.Nancy PaxtonThank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri, and after that we’ll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you’ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future products.Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple’s Form 10-K for 2014 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. And I’d also just like to remind you that as we indicated in our last quarterly call, we’re now including the results of our retail stores in the geographic segments where the stores are located and retail is no longer classified as an operating segment.We’ve also updated our product summary reporting and we’re now reflecting five categories of results; iPhone, iPad, Mac, Services and Other Products. We’ve prepared schedules showing reclassifications of historical operating segment and product results for each of the last 12 quarters to conform to these new groupings and they are available now on our Web site at apple.com/investor.So I’d now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.Tim CookThanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today we’re reporting on a historic quarter and I'm incredibly proud of everyone who contributed to the amazing results you’re about to hear. Interest in Apple products is at an all time high, with over 0.5 billion customer visits to our physical and online stores during the quarter. Demand for iPhone has been staggering, shattering our high expectations with sales of over 74 million units, driven by the unprecedented popularity of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. This volume is hard to comprehend. On average we sold over 34,000 iPhones every hour, 24 hours a day, everyday of the quarter.The execution by all of our teams to achieve these results was spectacular. By the end of the quarter, our new iPhones were available in 130 countries around the world, making this our fastest and most successful roll out ever. Additionally, the App Store and the Mac each set new records for quarterly revenues. Mac units were up 14% to 5.5 million, while the rest of the PC market continued to decline. App Store revenues was up a remarkable 41%. Demand was strong around the world. Flurry estimated that Apple products accounted for over half of all mobile device activations globally from December 19th to December 25th.It was truly a momentous quarter for iOS. On November 22nd we shipped our 1 billionth iOS device. It was a Space Gray 64 gigabyte iPhone 6 Plus, which we’ve saved here at Apple. 1 billion devices is an almost unfathomable milestone, and we are all incredibly proud to be a part of it. Apple’s mission is to make the greatest products on earth and enrich the lives of others. Through the success of iOS we have provided hundreds and millions of people with powerful personal technology that is simple and fun to use. Our customers are using Apple products to transform education, discover new ideas for business and express their creativity in ways that no one could have imagined when we sold the first iPhone less than eight years ago. It’s amazing to watch and it reminds that people and great ideas are the reasons we make the things we make."

IBM's Return On Equity And Sustainable Growth,Jun. 8.15,"This article is a follow-up to a previous piece, ""IBM Quality of Earnings: A Quick Rebuttal."" A reader of that article gave ""bullish"" IBM (NYSE:IBM) opinions, in the comments, by referring to the company's ""high"" return on equity.So now let us look at IBM's ""high"" return on equity and how it has been achieved. A description of how I analyzed IBM's return on equity, using DuPont analysis, can be found here. It describes three- and five-part analysis for looking at a company's return on equity.{ 3 Part DuPont Analysis}ROE = (net income / sales) * (sales / assets) * (assets / shareholders' equity)ORROE = (net profit margin) * (asset turnover) * (equity multiplier { aka Financial Leverage}){ 5 Part DuPont Analysis}ROE = [(EBIT / sales) * (sales / assets) - (interest expense / assets)] * (assets / equity) * (1 - tax rate)ORROE = [(operating profit margin) * (asset turnover) - (interest expense rate)] * (equity multiplier { aka Financial Leverage}) * (tax retention rate)In Charts 1 & 2 below is the last, five years of IBM's return on equity using DuPont analysis.Chart 1Chart 2Source: IBM's SEC filings & my calculationsIn Chart 1, one clearly sees that IBM has been using financial leverage (equity multiplier), to increase its return on equity. From 2010 to 2014, both net profit margin and asset turnover fell, while financial leverage (equity multiplier) rose from 4.84 to 6.98!"
IBM Is Trading Below Its Intrinsic Value,Jun.30.15,"International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has declined since hitting a peak of about $215 back in March 2013. The decline in the stock price was likely a result of the company's year-over-year declines in revenue from 2012 to the present. The good news is that the stock trades below its intrinsic value based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. The other positive factor is that IBM generates significant free cash flow, so the company is able to pay dividends and do share repurchases. The share repurchases have helped the company to post gains in EPS even while revenue has declined. Earnings also received a boost from IBM's strong increases in gross margin.IBM is a company where investors need to have a long-term view. When I say long term in this case, I'm talking 5 to 10 years. IBM is for the patient investor. Warren Buffet understands this patience. When he buys a company, Buffett actually prefers that the stock declines over the next few years so that he can accumulate more shares at lower prices, thus lowering his cost basis.I think that it will take a few more years for IBM to post year-over-year gains in revenue. The stock is likely to lag if IBM continues to post y-o-y revenue declines. I think that the main factor that will cause a change in investor perception will be when IBM posts revenue increases.In the meantime, current investors will collect the dividend while the company improves its top-line growth. IBM has consistently grown its ROE and gross margin over the past 10 years. These are the strong points that drive the company's profitability. How many companies can experience revenue declines, while increasing EPS? The fact that IBM can increase earnings in the face of revenue declines over multiple years shows that the company has strong core strengths. These strengths will be even more pronounced when IBM returns to a period of revenue growth. I think that this is what patient investors like Warren Buffett see in IBM as a long-term investment."
The Value Of IBM Strategic Imperatives,Aug.31.15,"The ""strategic imperatives"" are the main category where IBM (NYSE:IBM) is looking to create value for its shareholders. My goal in this article is to analyze the expected value that the ""strategic imperatives"" can derive. I am considering the growth prospects and market outlook for each category of the strategic imperatives in order to value this part of IBM business.I would like to mention that absolutely all of the financial information (about IBM) explained in this article is taken out of the 2013-14 annual, and 2015 quarterly reports (10-Ks and 10-Qs).As reported in the latest audited financial statements, the ""strategic imperatives"" accounted for a total of 27% of revenue in 2014. In 2010 the strategic imperatives have only accounted for 13% of IBM's revenue. The graph below shows how quickly this area of IBM business is growing.The letter by Virginia Rometty, Chairman and CEO of IBM, in the 2014 Annual Report states that the strategic imperatives involve five areas: analytics, cloud, mobile, social and security. After researching what all of these business entails, I found that analytics function as a core part of all other areas. Because analytics is pretty much the foundation for cloud, security, social and mobile (all of these areas function effectively thanks to analytics). I will value the cloud, security, social, and mobile parts of the strategic imperatives assuming that analytics is built into them."
IBM Should Spin Off Its Legacy Business Of Installing Software And Consulting Services,Jul.16.15,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) has in the past been known for taking initiatives to adapt to changing technology and business environments, most notably the divestiture of its early PC operation and recent sale of its older server business. Over time, IBM has built itself into a more focused provider of software, consulting, system and data analytics. But within its narrower business realms, technological changes continue to bring new challenges. One that's in the forefront now is the shift in business software use from on-site installation with follow-on consulting services to off-site cloud subscription services via the Internet.IBM is making strides with its own cloud offerings to tailor to the changing needs of many business clients, now preferring to purchase software with ease and flexibility on the cloud. However, the company continues to retain its old system of selling licensed-based software under this new business scheme with no real compatibility between the two. This will eventually come as a great concern for the company when its own history of many innovations at different times demands at last a similar action amid the current technological change.It's true that licensed software still makes up about a quarter of the total software sales at IBM, roughly the same revenue level for subscription software - with the rest tied to the company's hardware sales. But continuing to run the on-premise software installation business along with a drastically different, new business endeavor of building cloud infrastructure to deliver software as a service all seems to be counter-intuitive. It may well hinder the company's efforts to both salvage the declining market for installed software and press ahead with the rising cloud business."
IBM: A 10-Year Review Of Return On Assets,Jun. 8.15,"To determine the underlying economic characteristics of a business, a quick and dirty ""one number check"" is to look at the business' return on equity (ROE). Historically, ROE for the average American business (using the S&P 500 as a proxy for this) has ranged between 12%-17%. Thus, any business with ROE consistently higher than 17% can be considered ""above average"".Unfortunately, ROE can often be misleading. There are 4 major (but not the only) factors that influence ROE (apart from the competitive position of the business):turnover;leverage;taxes;operating margins.In particular, businesses with awful economic characteristics can be milked to generate high ROE by taking on significant debt. This can be a risky proposition.To strip out the effect of leverage, it can be useful to instead look at a business' return on assets (ROA). Further, one may reasonably argue that it makes more sense to look at pre-tax ROA in order to gauge the underlying business without having tax strategies clouding the view.The purpose of this article is to provide a 10-year review of IBM's (NYSE:IBM) pre-tax ROA.Some IBM-specific commentsIn the case of IBM, there is one major issue with naively looking at return on assets. Namely, IBM has a financing segment - Global Financing (it will be convenient to abbreviate this to GF), which provides financing to IBM clients. Although GF is a nice bonus to IBM's earnings power, in order to assess the intrinsic characteristics of IBM's business it is important to exclude its effects in our calculations.As an aside, let me point out that any reader who wishes to evaluate IBM's ROE without excluding Global Financing etc., should also keep in mind that the significant amount of treasury stock on IBM's balance sheet distorts the E (equity) in ROE. One can argue that this distortion is an accounting fiction rather than any reflection of economic reality. However, I do not wish to get into a discussion of this at the moment."
IBM's Long-Term Strategic Problem,Oct.21.15,"It would be much too harsh a judgment to say that IBM (NYSE:IBM) cannot survive in any form into the medium term. But the basic model of computing that IBM operates in is disappearing. And that means that eventually, so will the firm. It doesn't have to be overnight and there's very good profits that can be made from managing the decline, but there's a good case to be made that, other perhaps than Watson, the company's had it.This judgment comes from looking at the recent results. The headline numbers are well enough known. A stronger dollar reduces the value of overseas earnings (much the majority at the company) and this quarter saw the effect of the sale of the server business to Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), meaning that turnover numbers aren't directly comparable. However, the worry is in fact here:In recent years, the company has invested heavily in new areas that are growing rapidly, like data analytics, its Watson artificial-intelligence software, cloud computing, mobile applications and security. In 2014, its growth businesses delivered $25 billion in revenue, or 27 percent of corporate sales.IBM's so-called strategic initiatives are expected to grow by at least 20 percent this year. The company reported on Monday that these businesses had grown by 27 percent so far this year, excluding currency translation. By 2018, the company predicts, the growth portfolio will generate revenue of about $40 billion, more than 40 percent of the corporate total.That's great, of course it is, but again other than Watson that's not going to be enough. Because of course the point is to produce profits, not revenue. And IBM's standard pricing policies just aren't going to work in this brave new world. For those pricing policies always have been to price at the value of the computing to the user, not anything to do with the cost to IBM.Back in the days of punch card machines and Hollerith tabulators this was quite explicit. To run the same machine twice as fast (really, exactly the same machine) required the monthly lease payment to be doubled. They're a little more canny about it now and have been for some time but still."
IBM's 21st Century Transition Is Failing,Aug.25.15,"Some investors attribute IBM's (NYSE:IBM) poor 21st Century performance to a short-term technology lapse. They believe that if IBM can just get its technical mojo back - in areas such as cloud, security, data, analytics and mobile - it will recover. These investors are waiting on that one announcement that will make a difference: chip technology, medical acquisition or IBM's Watson. Unfortunately for these investors, the 20th Century IBM was never a centralized, one-trick technology pony. It was a decentralized, constitution-driven, independent-thinking corporation. As a $100 billion corporation, it will not find continual growth in a handful of technologies. A Hail Mary technology may postpone the predictable, but it will not prevent the inevitable. IBM needs execution. It needs constant invention, innovation and motivation from its 400,000 employees, not more directives from Armonk.Other investors believe IBM's technology is its protective moat. But the substance of the company's moat mystifies those that were never employed by, or a customer of, the 20th Century IBM. Its moat was its culture. This cultural moat protected any cracks in IBM's technology walls - and there were always cracks. It was a culture of customer service; a culture of employee respect, enthusiasm and dedication; a culture of resolute, long-term minded investors; and a culture that society respected and supported. This moat has been drained by an unrelenting me-first and -only executive strategy that has failed all of IBM's stakeholders.Let's summarize a few of these failures from my previous Seeking Alpha articles."
Valuing IBM By Comparison To Its Competitors,Nov. 3.15,"As of this moment, I'm looking at hefty unrealized losses on an outsize position in International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). In reviewing the situation, I evaluated the company by comparing it to the competitors listed on its most recent 10-K. This article presents the analysis and invites comment and criticism from readers.There is no data available for Dell, which is privately owned, and the data I used didn't contain information on Fujitsu. Aside from that, all major competitors are considered. I used Portfolio123 to develop the information, consisting of 3 year historical growth rates for EPS and Sales, together with average analyst estimates of long-term growth, average recommendations on a scale of 1 (strong buy) to 5 (sell) and forward P/E.Feeding the information into online multiple linear regression (abbreviated MLR) software, I received a formula for forward P/E, derived from the other variables, and calculated values for that metric, based on the formula developed.If IBM were valued on the same basis as its peers, forward P/E would be 12.7, rather than 9.4, resulting in a share price of $190. If it takes two years to reach that level, capital appreciation would be 16% per year, to which one can add the dividend, currently yielding 3.7%. The patient investor has a reasonable expectation of capital appreciation, and he will be paid to wait."
Stop Hating IBM: It's Enormously Profitable,Oct.29.15,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) has been beat up over the last several years. Revenue has declined in 14 consecutive quarters, and the stock price has lost a third of its value. Media pundits decry things like ""IBM missed the cloud opportunity,"" and ""it's a dinosaur kept alive with financial engineering."" But the reality is that IBM is a cash generation machine. It's currently significantly undervalued by the market, and it has a clear path to increasing its intrinsic value even further.Why has IBM's stock price declined?For starters, IBM's stock price has declined because revenue, profits and guidance are declining. And IBM looks even worse when compared to some of its hyped-up peers that are receiving all sorts of cloud glorification (e.g. Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), more on this later). However, IBM's declining revenues and profits are not entirely due to bad decisions by the company. In addition to bad decisions (such as their cloud strategy, more on this below) the declines also are due to the same macroeconomic headwinds that other companies are facing as well as spending by IBM to reposition itself for more profits in the future. It's worth reviewing some of these factors to help shed light on the partially false narrative that IBM's revenues and profits are declining simply because it's a horrible company (IBM is not a horrible company)."

Why IBM Buys The Weather Company,"Oct. 28, 2015 2:38 PM ET","IBM (NYSE:IBM) is trading at a price not seen for a long time, as the company got hit by a negative reaction to earnings as well as a negative reaction to a revenue recognition probe by the SEC.Yesterday IBM also announced that the company would acquire the Weather Company in a $2 billion deal. The Weather Company wanted to sell itself for $3 billion since August (the company was valued at $3.5 billion in 2008), it seems a buyer has been found now.Buying the Weather Company means a couple of positives for IBM:First, this acquisition will increase IBM's revenues (and likely also earnings and cash flows) in the future. The Weather Company's forecasting unit already sells data / licenses its services to more than 5000 customers (source) which are dependent on accurate weather information, such as airlines & airport operators, insurance companies, agriculture, power production (e.g. wind mills & solar parks). Additionally, the Weather Company receives revenues from almost 100 million subscribers to the Weather Channel (source).The Weather Company's annual revenues are $340 million (source), by acquiring the Weather Company these revenues (and associated cash flows and earnings) will go to IBM's pocket in the future.The next point is that this acquisition further positions IBM as one of the leaders in a market which will grow immensely in the future: Predictive analytics. With its Watson system and its Smarter Planet unit IBM is already well positioned here, but all the data, the models and the human talent that will come with the Weather Company acquisition will increase IBM's capabilities in this area further. Predictive analytics are already used in marketing, financial services, healthcare and other fields, but there is a lot of points this technology could be used in the future (think about security, crime prevention & detection etc.). The people working at the Weather Company know how to come up with solutions to predict outcomes in one area, but since the statistical / mathematical methods are mostly the same in other areas, this talent can also be used to push IBM's predictive capabilities in other areas. In combination with IBM's Watson unit (which is doing well in healthcare and retail) and Smarter Planet this makes IBM one of the leaders in this area.The Weather Company's predictive abilities also improves the services of other IBM units, e.g. using the Weather Company's ability to forecast weather situations with high accuracy, Smarter Planet can optimize power generation and grids further, by letting the operators of gas-fired plants know beforehand when solar panels are about to increase or decrease their production due to changes in the local weather (the same works for wind power).IBM thus gets a lot of positives from this deal: Higher revenues, improvements to its existing offerings and overall better predictive abilities (which will grow in other areas with the help of the Weather Company's data, models and human talent). For a price of $2 billion, which is a lot less than the price the company was valued at in 2008, this sounds like an attractive deal for IBM (which has about $10 billion in cash, so there is no need to take on any debt for this deal).I also want to shortly show that the company is not in too much debt at all, as this is something a lot of people get wrong: IBM has a cash position of $9.6 billion and a debt load of $39.7 billion. $26 billion of these $39.7 billion belong to IBM's Global Financing segment, which functions as a bank. IGF has a leverage ratio of 7:1, which is a rather low number in comparison to other banks. With $26 billion of debt belonging to IGF, this leaves $13.7 billion of debt for IBM ex IGF. $13.7 billion of debt for a company with $9.6 billion in cash and free cash flows of $13.6 billion in the last twelve months doesn't look like a problem at all -- if IBM wished to do so the company could pay back all of its non-IGF debt in less than a year. IBM has a AA- rating by Standard & Poor, which shows how fundamentally intact the company is (and how investing in the company is low risk).ValuationI used the finbox model to determine a fair price for IBM (which also functions as a check for whether one should enter a position now). Using a strong revenue decline in 2015, a small revenue decline in 2016 and light revenue growth beyond, as well as an exit EBITDA multiple of 8 (in comparison to a peer group average of 14), I get to a fair price of about $168, which means that the company's shares have upside of about twenty percent according to my calculation.I also used the Discounted Cash Flow method to determine a fair price for IBM's shares:At first we have to calculate the weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC), with a risk free rate of 4.0 percent, IBM's beta of 0.63 and an equity risk premium of 7.0 percent IBM's cost of equity is 8.4 percent. IBM's cost of debt is 2.4 percent, the after-tax cost of debt is 1.8 percent. With an equity valued at $141 billion and debt valued at $43 billion, IBM's WACC is thus 6.9 percent -- this is our discount factor.risk free rate 4.0IBM's beta 0.63equity risk premium 7.0IBM's cost of equity 8.4IBM's cost of debt 2.4after-tax cost of debt 1.8equity / (equity + debt) 0.767debt / (equity + debt) 0.233WACC 6.9IBM's free cash flow over the last twelve months was $13.2 billion, the growth rate over the last ten years was 2.5 percent (annually). When we assume that free cash flows will continue to grow by 2.5 percent annually over the next five years, and that free cash flows will then remain flat, we get to a total present value (of IBM's free cash flows) of $213 billion.  Nominal value Present value2015 $13.2 billion $13.2 billion2016 $13.5 billion $12.6 billion2017 $13.9 billion $12.2 billion2018 $14.2 billion $11.6 billion2019 $14.6 billion $11.2 billion2020 $14.9 billion $10.7 billionFrom 2021   $141.5 billionTotal   $213 billionIn order to get to the value of IBM's shares, we have to subtract the present value of IBM's debt from the total present value, which gets us to a present equity value of $170 billion.By dividing the total equity value by the number of shares, we get to the value of each individual share. In IBM's case (using a diluted share count of 980 million), this gets us to a fair value of $173 per share.This is pretty much in line with the per share value of $168 I calculated above (using the EBITDA model), and signifies my argument that IBM's shares are undervalued right now. With an upside of about twenty percent right now looks like a good time to buy IBM's shares. Warren Buffet seems to agree that IBM's shares are undervalued right now, according to Reuters he told CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway has been adding more IBM shares during the third quarter (source).TakeawayIBM wants to buy the Weather Company, which will strengthen the company's predictive analytics abilities, increase revenues and make IBM's other services more valuable. For $2 billion this deal looks attractive to me.I also believe that IBM continues to be undervalued right now, according to my calculations the company has upside of about twenty percent.Disclosure: I am/we are long IBM.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
The Magic Of IBM Share Buybacks In 2 Charts,Aug. 7.15,"My largest stock holding is IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM), and I'm happy about that. And, when the price drops, my joy increases, because I am a net buyer of IBM stock and therefore it's been impossible for me to lose any real money. You cannot lose if you don't sell and the business doesn't go bankrupt, especially if you're collecting dividends.I'm enjoying a healthy dividend yield and dividend growth. A quick glance tells me that the Chowder on IBM is about 18, which is calculated simply by adding current yield and average 5-year dividend growth (3% + 15%). So, again, just buying and holding, and not selling while stock price goes up and down works just fine.Now, while I believe that looking to the future is critical to investing, I admit that I enjoy looking at history. Indeed, history might not repeat itself exactly, but it certainly seems to rhyme. So I'm going to show you two charts that squeeze my greed gland. And, we're going to narrowly focus on just share buybacks while pretty much excluding everything else.First, as something of a warning, I agree with Warren Buffett on share buybacks, page 19:""The third use of funds - repurchases - is sensible for a company when its shares sell at a meaningful discount to conservatively calculated intrinsic value. Indeed, disciplined repurchases are the surest way to use funds intelligently: It's hard to go wrong when you're buying dollar bills for 80¢ or less.""I like getting a discount.But, here's the thing. I like to know that I'm getting a discount. I am not a fan of guessing or wondering about it. I like to have a lot of confidence, even if I'm not entirely accurate, because it's just plain obvious to me. I want to see the discount and feel it in my bones."
The Last Few Years Of IBM Profitability,Jul.24.15,"There are several ways to measure the profitability of a company over the long term. In this article, I will use ROA and ROE to analyze the profitability of IBM (NYSE:IBM) for the past five years. The beauty about ROA and ROE is that it can be decomposed into other ratios. ROA can be decomposed into profit margin and asset turnover. ROE can be decomposed into profit margin, asset turnover and financial leverage.The analysis I am presenting in this article is also known as DuPont analysis. For this analysis, I take the last five years of reported annual results (from calendar year (CY) 2010 to CY2014). The main purpose of this article is to give readers a picture of IBM's profitability in the past few years.This article is divided into three main sections and a conclusion. Section 1 discusses ROA in detail. Section 2 discusses ROE in detail. Section 3 discusses income statement margins. A conclusion is followed.1. Return on Assets (ROA)In order to better analyze ROA, the ratio is decomposed into asset turnover ratio and profit margin.Asset Turnover RatioAsset turnover measures how well a company uses its assets to generate revenue. It is defined as total revenues divided by average total assets. For this ratio (as well as other ratios), I use a two-year average.The ratio of asset turnover has decreased from 0.93 in 2011 to 0.76 in 2014. This decrease affects profitability negatively. Both portions of the asset turnover equation have actually contributed to a decrease in total asset turnover. Total revenues (the numerator) have continually decreased for all IBM's business segments from $106.9 billion in 2011 to $92.8 billion in 2014. For every fiscal year since 2011, total revenues have decreased at an average rate of 1.7% annually. The last year IBM had revenue growth was from 2010 to 2011."
"Retirees: I Did Not Buy IBM To Sell; It's About The Dividend Income, Stupid",Oct.23.15,"IntroductionThere are many investing strategies and principles that retired investors can utilize to reduce the risk associated with investing in equities (stocks) for their retirement portfolios. Choosing to invest in the highest quality stocks your mind can conceive sits at the top of the list. There are many components that investors can analyze and examine to determine whether a company is of high quality or not.The primary determinant of high quality is superior financial strength. Financially strong companies possess the staying power and resources to weather the occasional bad storms that will inevitably occur. Every business will on occasion face challenges and difficulties. Meeting those challenges requires a strong balance sheet and an adaptive and competent management team to guide the company across troubled waters.Evaluating financial strength can be accomplished through the examination of a few simple but important fundamental metrics. Fortunately, much of that work is already done for us by established and reputable reporting agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Value Line, Morningstar, etc., in the form of credit ratings.There are many available sources where retired investors can find that information. The key is to look for companies that are awarded what is referred to in financial circles as investment-grade ratings. Typically, the companies with the best ratings will have a capital A or better in their credit rating.Retired investors concerned with safety can dig deeper by examining important fundamentals such as cash flow, free cash flow, and debt levels. Stated overly-simplistically, you will be looking for companies that have the strength of cash flows to support debt payments and current and future dividend distributions. Regarding safety considerations, cash flows are more relevant than earnings. Because when it comes to the survival of a business, cash flow is king. As it relates to safety, a business surviving as an ongoing concern is the last line of defense."
IBM's Opportunity In The Telecom Industry And Rivalry With Intel,Dec.21.15,"In a recent development, IBM (NYSE:IBM) is taking the charge of AT&T's (NYSE:T) cloud based managed hosting and application services business. The assets associated with the services will be included in IBM's cloud portfolio. This is in line with IBM's telecom strategy. Philip Guido, IBM General Manager of Global Technology Services for North America, said:Today's announcement represents an expansion of our strategic relationship with AT&T and continuing collaboration to deliver new innovative solutions. Working with AT&T, we will deliver a robust set of IBM Cloud and managed services that can continuously evolve to meet clients' business objectives.Telecom operators are expanding their focus on cloud, analytics and mobility like never before. For IBM this is a tremendous growth opportunity with its solution labs, research labs and innovation centers. In this article I will dig deeper in IBM's telecom business.Why AT&T Is Transferring Facilities And Hosting Divisions?IBM will acquire AT&T's equipment and access its data centers where the equipment are installed. AT&T (like many other big telcos) is offloading some of its non-core assets for paying off debt and raising funds for investments. This is a new trend traditional telecom operators are following.The telecom industry is witnessing a host of challenges, such as competitive pressure, mature markets, adapting to rapid technological changes and proliferation of product offerings. To cope with the situation, major operators are restructuring their business by bringing a meaningful shift in their operations. The shift primarily involves sharing similar tasks and selling data centers. This is what AT&T is also doing."
On IBM's Pension Liabilities,Aug.28.15,"A popular part of the narrative surrounding IBM (NYSE:IBM) on Seeking Alpha (and elsewhere) is IBM's high headline debt number (about $39 billion according to the latest 10-Q). This is often combined with a statement along the lines of: IBM has taken on enormous debt to fund its financial engineering shenanigans, aka share repurchases.It has been pointed out (mainly in commentary on Seeking Alpha) that most of IBM's debt is in its Global Financing (GF) segment (roughly $26 billion). Financing (i.e., a bank like entity) utilizes debt like a mammal utilizes oxygen. Roughly, the point is that GF utilizes IBM's stellar debt rating to borrow in capital markets at low rates and then turns around and lends at higher rates to customers, making a profit off the spread (this is only a rough, but essentially right, approximation to GF operations). The risk in such an activity primarily stems from the degree of leverage, duration mismatch (the classic problem of borrowing short term to lend long term) and credit risk (will the borrowers repay). In IBM's case there's also residual value risk associated to equipment leases (think of the risk to a dealer in leasing a car), but we don't need to get into the nitty gritty here.The purpose of this article is not to assess the risk in Global Financing (for the moment, suffice it to say that I think that it is minimal). Instead, I wish to address a follow-up argument that is often made along the lines of ""in the end all debt is debt, whether is financing or core or whatever.""I'm going to do this in a twisted way by pointing out that IBM detractors who worry about the $39 billion debt number should be focusing on a much more dangerous liability which sports a much higher headline number.Namely, IBM's total pension benefit obligation at year end 2014 exceeded $100 billion (see the latest 10-K).Let me be clear, I am NOT saying that IBM is in a GM style sinkhole. IBM's pension liabilities seem to be quite conservatively funded."
IBM: Value Or Value Trap? Should You Buy?,Aug. 7.15,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) is a battleground stock. There are price target pronouncements ranging from $120 (from a bearish Credit Suisse analyst) to $200 being put out, without explicitly stated assumptions. Warren Buffett has stated the mid-$150's to be a price below which he would increase his position, and Warren's valuations (even if opaque) carry weight. I've taken a couple of approaches to an IBM valuation to seed the discussion, one courtesy of Aswath Damodaran (described below) and the other a more traditional annuity based approach. I leave you with these, a speculative wildcard, and my position on handicapping the likely futures.Aswath Damodaran is an NYU Professor who gained fame for his book The Dark Side of Valuation, focusing in particular on valuing hard-to-value companies, in particular Technology companies. Damodaran has been notably generous in posting his lectures, spreadsheets and case studies on his NYU web site as a means of educating the public, and is well known in the financial journalism community. I use one of these spreadsheets with numbers from IBM's 2014 annual report and 10K's to arrive at the Damodaran valuation.The Damodaran Valuation : Some AssumptionsFor a slow growth company such as IBM, two important assumptions that need to be stated upfront is the 'collar' (up and downside) in growth and free-cash-flow assumptions, the share count trends. These are key values in the Damodaran model that notably affect the result.IBM's presentation on strategic imperatives states:a low single-digits revenue growth target (that I interpret as a 1-5% range),2-3% share reduction (so roughly 20 million share buyback per year)reduction of FCF returned to shareholders from 100% in the last few years to 80%. This can be interpreted as their dividend growth continuing, but at about 10-12% (which is 80% of the 15% dividend growth in the past 5 years)"
"Microsoft, Intel Or IBM: Which Is Best For Long-Term Dividend Investors?","Sep. 21, 2015 7:05 PM ET","After Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) 16.1% dividend increase, its yield is now up to par with the technology industry's dividend elite, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). With each stock paying a forward yield well in excess of 3%, and most investors liking to hold at least one high yield, large technology company in their portfolio, it might be beneficial to determine which of these three dividend stocks is best to own long term.One of the first things dividend investors look at when deciding between two or more long-term dividend investments is the payout ratio. This is the percentage of net income that a company pays in dividends, and tells investors whether a company's dividend is affordable and whether a company can continue to increase its dividend. If you look strictly at the payout ratio, you would likely conclude that Microsoft made a big mistake in increasing its quarterly dividend. Microsoft's payout ratio is 82% vs. Intel and IBM each with a payout ratio well under 40% each. However, payout ratios can be very misleading.Specifically, payout ratios deal with net income, and net income takes into account one-time events and does not properly weigh capital expenditures. For example, Microsoft reported a $7.5 billion impairment charge related to its Nokia handset acquisition. That charge was reported on its income statement against net income, but was a one-time event, thereby not relevant to whether Microsoft can afford its dividend long term.That's why it's much better to look at a company's dividend payments vs. free cash flow, a metric of bottom line performance that is much more consistent year to year and accounts for capital expenditures. In other words, free cash flow is a better reflection of profits, thereby telling investors whether a company can afford its dividend."
"IBM Is A Bet On Weaker Dollar, Higher Interest Rates And Inflation",Nov.26.15,"My personal opinion is that International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is an excellent value stock worth buying at the current price for the very long run. Although we can argue about the future outlook, ""financial engineering"" complaints and many other risks and question marks, the undeniable fact is that IBM's focus on margins, free cash flow generation and focus on future growth drivers make it a great value stock trading at below 10x P/FCF and roughly 10x P/E. Many other valuation metrics are attractive, as well, even if the company just manages to keep the EPS flat over time. But these topics have been widely covered. Let's explore some of the additional considerations and benefits of owning IBM for the overall portfolio.IBM has traded in lockstep with the euro/dollar currency pairIf we look at a multi-year chart of IBM starting roughly when Buffett started buying IBM, we see a strikingly high correlation of IBM with the euro/dollar currency pair, represented here by the CurrencyShares Euro Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:FXE). Basically, all IBM's price losses can be attributed to the dollar's strength against the company's major foreign markets' currencies, such as euro, yen and other Asian and Latin American currencies."
IBM: The Future Looks Exciting,Oct. 8.15,"There have been significant discussions regarding the issues at International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). First, there is a considerable chunk of the business that is not growing or even in decline. Then, they have disposed of assets that were not performing well (possibly mismanaged) which reduced revenues. Next, many believe future revenue growth will be low. Finally, there is the potential of shrinking margins; and those are just some of the concerns. However, IBM is not dead and is still innovating, buying innovative companies, and making progress on several fronts. In this article, I discuss a few of IBMs potential areas of growth.NanotubesIBM has been working on carbon nanotube technology for over two decades and just recently announced that there may be light at the end of the tunnel. Lead researcher, Shu-Jen Han said ""if it pushed ahead at 7 nanometers, the industry could expect nanotube CPUs in five years."" ""If it invests in a smaller size, then it will be five to 10 years."" The issue with current technology is that silicon based transistors are approaching a point of physical limitations. While it is expected that CPUs based on nanotubes will lead to denser computing architectures there have been issues with contact resistance in smaller sizes. The IBM scientists were able to solve these challenges and the breakthrough could ""overcome contact resistance challenges all the way to the 1.8 nanometer node - four technology generations away."" The technology could lead to more powerful smartphones and longer battery lives. However, IBM has competition. For example, as recently as 2014 China was believed to be the leader in carbon nanotube technology. IBM admits that the technology is still several years away and will be a use of cash flow, not a source for at least 5-10 years as stated above. Still, this could become a very large and lucrative project for IBM that could put IBM technology into every smart phone, tablet, and PC."
A Textbook Valuation Of IBM,Oct. 7.15,"International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is a wonderful company. But why do I think IBM is a wonderful company?Because it is one of very few public companies that has paid dividends since 1913. That is some 100+ years since the first dividend was paid, not bad for a tech company. IBM is a company that survived the Great Depression, World War II, the Tech Bubble, and the Great Recession. Because the company has so much dividend history, one way I can evaluate it is by using a dividend discount model.Dividend Discount ModelThe dividend discount model is a textbook valuation for preferred stocks. The value of the stock is based on the dividends it pays. More specifically, the value of the stock is the present value (PV) of its future dividend payments plus a terminal value (if going concern is assumed). Although IBM has quite a lot of debt (as I explained in a previous article), I don't think it will be out of business anytime soon. Therefore, I assumed a going concern, which means that IBM will continue in business for the foreseeable future.Despite the fact that this model is a preferred stock valuation, IBM's common stock behaves pretty much like a preferred stock with no redemption (or call) features or no caps in its dividends. Its common stock has not only been paying dividends, but also consistently increasing its dividend payments for many years. Since IBM is a solid company with strong cash-generating ability (it generated free cash flows of $12.4 billion last year), I think its dividends are a reliable source of income. With that in mind, let's look at the last 15 years of IBM's dividends in the next graph:"
IBM On An Acquisition Spree,Dec.11.15,"IBM's (NYSE:IBM) revenues have been on a decline for 14 consecutive quarters now and it has been trying hard to drive its focus toward the cloud, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and analytics. IBM has made 12 acquisitions this year, with the cloud and its cognitive system Watson driving them.IBM's FinancialsIBM's third quarter revenue declined 13.9% over the year to $19.3 billion, falling short of the market's expectations of $19.6 billion. EPS of $3.34 was, however, ahead of the Street's projections of $3.30.By segment, revenues from global technology services declined 10.2% over the year to $7.9 billion. Global Business services continued to report a decline and revenues fell 13.1% to $4.2 billion. Software revenues declined 10% to $5.1 billion and systems hardware revenues were down 38.7% to $2.06 billion. Global Financing revenues reduced 8.1% to $447 million.During the third quarter, revenues from its strategic imperatives of the cloud, analytics, social, mobile and security grew 27% and 30% year-to-date. Cloud revenue grew 65% year-to-date and analytics grew 20% year-to-date. Security business was up 12%, social up about 40%, and mobile business quadrupled. It expects them to represent more than 40% of the company's business by 2018, or revenue of about $40 billion, compared to $25 billion for 2014. These business units have also helped IBM improve gross margins, from 40% a decade ago to 50% in the most recent quarter.IBM lowered its full-year 2015 guidance for non GAAP EPS to a range of $14.75-$15.75 from $15.75-$16.50.IBM Bets Big on WatsonWatson follows the human thinking process of observing, interpreting, evaluating and decision making to help automate processes across multiple industries. In January 2014, IBM invested $1 billion to set up the Watson Business Group to recast the natural language learning system as the force behind cloud analytics services for the pharmaceutical, retail, banking, media and education industries. IBM says healthcare will be one of its biggest growth areas over the next 10 years. So in April this year, IBM turned up the heat on Watson with the launch of Watson Health, its first vertical offering involving the technology."
Box: IBM Integration Underlines My Microsoft And General Takeover Target Thesis,Jun.24.15,"Box (NYSE:BOX) is out with huge news Wednesday morning in regards to a comprehensive integration with IBM (NYSE:IBM). This integration, which is just 8 days after Box announced a similarly huge integration with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for its Microsoft Office 365, further confirms my speculation that Box is ""on the block"" as an acquisition target.I recently opined that Box, the polarizing ECC platform provider, could be being looked at as a potential platform addition for Microsoft in that Microsoft's integration signals a concession of OneDrive market share. It should also be noted, which wasn't mentioned in my article, that Microsoft also has a substantially similar integration with Box competitor Dropbox. That said, I believe this to only underline my speculation that Microsoft has conceded its OneDrive market share. Also, that Microsoft is instead trying to first promote the take rate of its productivity suite while secondarily building a ""wish list"" for cloud storage and collaboration providers."
GE Could Buy IBM,Sep.15.15,"Back in August I wrote a speculative article about General Electric (NYSE:GE) buying EMC (EMC).The idea was that GE helped VMware (NYSE:VMW), of which EMC owns 80%, create Pivotal Software, in which GE is an investor. Pivotal is where GE focused its early hopes on the Internet of Things. EMC, meanwhile, is trying to simplify its ownership structure to allow CEO Joe Tucci to retire, and an outright sale would simplify things.It didn't happen, and I didn't expect it to happen. EMC is now studying whether a merger into VMware might make sense. It might. But this is not a story about EMC.This is a story about GE, and its ambition for the Internet of Things. In its latest reorganization, GE has taken all its software assets, creating a new unit called GE Digital, and put it all under Bill Ruh, a former Cisco CSCO executive.The aim, according to GE CEO Jeff Immelt, is to grow the unit from $6 billion into a ""top 10"" software outfit by 2020. That's not really ambitious. If GE Digital's $6 billion in revenue were all from software it's already number six, just ahead of EMC.IBM is number three in software, with $29.1 billion in sales. GE's valuation is presently $255 billion, IBM's $144 billion. GE has $91 billion in cash on its books, and adding $70 billion in new shares to that pile would still keep GE management in firm control of the whole.The point here is that IBM is cheap, dirt cheap. It has the lowest Price/Earnings multiple in the tech sector, at 9.7. That's lower than General Motors (NYSE:GM), lower than Citicorp (NYSE:C), lower than almost any dividend-paying stock on the board, short of a Master Limited Partnership like Alerian (NYSEARCA:AMLP).GE could easily sell those parts of IBM it didn't want, or spin them off into a new company, and get back most of the cash needed to do this deal. By installing new management and focusing on the Internet of Things, GE would give IBM a new story to tell and, in the process, dramatically increase its value to investors. Buying IBM would also cement Immelt's own industrial strategy into place, making it nearly impossible for a successor to do to his company what he did to Jack Welch's outfit."
Why I'm Buying IBM Hand Over Fist,Aug.11.15,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) is arguably one of the most hated large cap stocks out there. Declining revenues and earnings continue to disappoint the market, and shares are down more than 20% from the stock's 52 week high of $195. But the market lacks a value that very few investors have - patience.By continuing to worry about IBM's current operating results, the market fails to see the long-term potential Big Blue has to offer. I'm genuinely fascinated by how two separate investors can see the same company through such a remarkably different lens. The company is clearly in a transitory phase, as it goes from being one of the largest hardware firms in the world to a services provider. But this evolution is old news, and there shouldn't be any surprises about the company's overall sluggish business performance in the near term.The strong dollar is only making Big Blue's transition tougher, as it continues to shed the fat in its low-margin businesses such as low-end servers, PCs, and semiconductors while beefing up its presence in high-margin areas such as data analytics, IT infrastructure, and cloud services. IBM sold its x86 server business to Lenovo last year, and arranged for chip maker Globalfoundries to take over its semiconductor business last month. IBM's most recent quarter announcement that revenue was down 13% was ugly. That is, until you strip away the divestitures and adjust for foreign exchange rates, which paints a much nicer picture, putting revenue down only 1%. Granted, this isn't delightful, but it demonstrates that 1) things aren't as terrible as they seem and 2) the transition is further along than most people realize."
IBM Is Far From Finished,Feb.29.16,"Much of the commentary surrounding IBM (NYSE:IBM) in recent years has been negative to say the least. The negativity stems from the transition that the venerable technology firm has been undergoing this last few years.IBM is in the process of transforming from being an IT hardware company to being an IT software and solutions company. Big Blue is getting to grips with the fact that mobile devices, information security and cloud computing are of increasing significance, and it is adapting accordingly.But the old-school tech firm, which was founded in 1911, is not neglecting its shareholders while this transition period is in progress. In 2010, IBM announced that it was aiming to benefit its shareholders by hitting $20 in earnings per share by 2015. This proposal was put forward by the previous CEO, Sam Palmisano, and was internally (and notoriously) referred to as Roadmap 2015.Divestment, Buyback and AcquisitionTo achieve these goals, IBM has made a considerable number of divestments of lower margin operations. In 2012, they sold their retail POS business to Toshiba TEC for $850 million, and in 2013 they sold their Customer Care unit to Synnex for $430 million in cash and $75 million in stock. In 2014, IBM paid Global Foundries $1.3 billion to take over their semiconductor manufacturing unit, and sold their x86 server business to Lenovo Group Ltd. (OTCPK:LNVGY) for $2.3 billion.In addition to these divestments, IBM has engaged in a massive share buyback program. Between 2000-2014, IBM had spent $108 billion on repurchasing shares and incurred debt to get the cash to do so. This has greatly benefited shareholders and was part of the reason why Warren Buffett overcame his reluctance to invest in tech stocks in November 2011 when he purchased 5.5% of IBM's stock for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) at a cost of $10 billion. Buffett cited IBM's entrenched links with multiple IT departments worldwide, Roadmap 2015 and the firm's shareholder friendly culture as his reasons for buying into the company."
IBM: An Ugly Quarter But A Beautiful Future Awaits The Patient Investor,Apr.20.16,"Overview:IBM's (NYSE:IBM) 1Q 2016 presentation was made on April 18th and although it met previous expectations laid out by management earlier in the year, it was not pretty. There is no amount of lipstick that will make this piggy quarter look good.But underneath all this ugliness were the outlines of a much brighter future for IBM, its customers and most importantly its shareholders. I know it seems like it is taking forever but IBM's transition to a new business model is on track and will result in much larger profits and cash flow in the coming years. I have outlined my thoughts on this process before here ""5 Reasons IBM Is A Buy Whether You Like The Weather Or Not"" and here ""IBM: Like AT&T, But With More Upside"".In this article, I will examine the behind the scenes process that will make IBM one of the best and safest investments in the coming years.""Ugly is not the absence of beauty.Ugly is the inability to identify it.""Kamand KojouriWatson powered health app to support veterans. Source IBM.First the bad news, then the good news.When comparing the current quarter results with last year's quarter, we see another example of the challenges facing IBM management to turn the company from a mostly hardware company to a mostly software and services company. It is an arduous task for a small company, let alone one of IBM's massive size and reach. And if you look at the raw dollars for the last 4 years (16 quarters) where revenue has been down, it looks real ugly. There is nowhere to hide 24%, 16% and 15% declines in sales, profits, and cash flow respectively."
Sell IBM,Apr.26.16,"…But the balance sheet looks great! (Source: semiwiki.com)Let's talk about International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). In March, I advised IBM holders to sell in April. Following my advice would have resulting in selling at a relative high:Today, however, we have even more reason to drop IBM. Others have written about IBM's earnings report, pointing out the concerns brought with the report. However, I do not think anyone has yet given a comprehensive picture of just how bad things are at IBM.In this article, I attempt to convince you that the fundamentals of IBM simply cannot justify holding the stock at this time. I realize this somewhat contradicts one of my previous articles on IBM, in which I laud the stock as a strong dividend addition to your portfolio. But if anything is going to change my mind, it's the company's worrisome fundamentals.IBM Is Hoarding CashLet's start with the fact that IBM is hoarding cash. Although a strong company might have much cash on hand, one that hoards cash is likely doing so for preparatory reasons. IBM's debt has jumped to $45.6B from $39.9B in one quarter.Logically, holding cash to pay down debt makes sense here, which is probably why IBM's cash on hand increased from $8.2B to $14.9B. The buildup of cash allows IBM not only to pay down debt should the time come, but it also helps artificially bolster their debt-to-cash ratio, which would have skyrocketed had the company used the cash to invest or expand - actions that are characteristic of a healthy company. Investors would be well-advised to remember that buying stock is an economic service that allows investors to leverage the higher ROI of private companies; when a private company stops using its income to expand and instead hoards cash, it is not fulfilling its end of the bargain."
"Yes, I'm Going To Compare Amazon And IBM",Mar. 9.16,"Bloomberg recently published an article that highlighted the most ""loved"" and ""hated"" stocks. Technology juggernauts Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) fell on different sides of the list. Which makes it interesting to see what investors are paying for each.Similar, but differentA comparison between IBM and Amazon isn't perfect. One is a massive online retailer that has other important technology businesses, like providing cloud computing, thrown in the mix. The other is a technology giant that helps business customers solve their technology problems. However, that involves things like cloud computing and could easily involve working with retailers.In fact, when Seeking Alpha readers comment on IBM, Amazon's services often come up as a reference point. Which is why stepping back and putting this pair up against each other is so interesting. If you were to buy these companies today, here's what you'd be paying...IBM's price to earnings ratio is around 10. Amazon's P/E is over 450. To be fair, IBM is in the midst of a big business transformation and its revenues have been declining as it sells off assets so it can refocus on higher margin businesses. That has investors concerned about the future and they have understandably pushed the shares lower. If you buy into IBM, you need to believe that the turnaround will work out.Amazon, meanwhile, is investing for growth and has been pretty much from day one. It's done a good job growing the top line, with revenues expanding at an annualized rate of 28% over the last decade. IBM's revenues have fallen at an annualized rate of around 1% over the same span, with more recent periods showing a quicker decline. The thing is, revenues are not earnings. Amazon's growth spending has often pushed its bottom line into the red. And while it earned $1.25 a share last year, the current share price, based on the price-to-earnings ratio, appears to be pricing in a huge amount of bottom line growth."
5 Reasons Why Buffett Might Still Be Holding IBM,Apr.24.16,"Investors who held on to IBM's (NYSE:IBM) stock after it fell to $120 but then rebounded should consider what to do next. It also helps that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) is not selling the stock. This prompts the question: what does Buffett see in IBM and why does he still like holding it? The question is more intriguing after Buffett conceded on CNBC to being ""the second dumbest guy about the cloud.""1) MoatDespite the bulk of its business units not growing in profits, revenue is still sizable, thanks to IBM's moat in holding many Fortune 500 core clients. In the first fiscal quarter of 2016, IBM's revenue was $18.7 billion while net income was $2.3 billion ($2.35 per share). Thanks to its enterprise clients continuing to do business with IBM, revenue grew 17 percent on a constant currency basis. It keeps its moat from eroding by continuing its role in offering critical IT solutions for these businesses. IBM's clients include Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), both of which Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has holdings in. Berkshire held $24 billion worth of Wells Fargo, or 10 percent of the company. He owns 16 percent of American Express.2) Customized offeringsMuch how Rackspace (NYSE:RAX) customizes its cloud computing offering to customers, so too does IBM in enterprise cloud-based software sales. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) grew market share by continually under-cutting prices of AWS against its competition. This turned cloud computing and storage into a commodity, but also helped Amazon.com sustain its share of the market. When Amazon.com reports quarterly results on April 28 after the market closes, note the AWS revenue growth against the change in profit margin. If profit margin erodes further, Amazon.com will need to reconsider its pricing model. It might consider upselling its AWS the way IBM does. It might have to boost staff support for customers to win customers that have less IT level of support."
Reasons To Avoid IBM; Its Relevance To The Overall Market,Apr.25.16,"BackgroundAs an IBM-watcher and sometimes long investor in it, I wrote several articles on IBM (NYSE:IBM) in 2013 and 2014 on Seeking Alpha, most of which were on bearish target (see below). This article is from the standpoint of a new money investor who is considering IBM shares versus other alternatives in various markets, or cash. There are many long-term holders of IBM who have large embedded gains, and given the uncertainties of all stock market analyses, assessments and forecasts, matters can look very different for those holders than for others. For these long-term holders, holding even if they agree with my points may be quite logical.As we know, IBM announced a surprise set of charges in Q1, largely offset by a $1 B+ (after-tax value) win on a long-running tax dispute.Layoffs and the like were the subject of several articles on IBM by me on Seeking Alpha in 2013 and into 2014, and briefly I turned bullish on IBM in 2014, thinking the worst was over and it could catch up to the raging bull market. But it did not perform operationally as I had hoped, and after that I began focusing on biotech so much for the rest of 2014 and 2015 that I did not write about IBM. Now I think it's important to do so, both on a company-specific basis and for what this might portend for the rest of the stock market (NYSEARCA:SPY).A brief introduction to my neutral-to-bearish thesis:IBM is unattractive at or near its current $148.50 price ($143 B market cap)There are four major points that make IBM an ""avoid"" for me. These are:"
IBM's Big Problem: It's Too Busy To Listen To Its Customers,May.24.16,"For quite a while now, I've been following IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and trying to find the value angle. It's so statistically cheap - and so universally regarded as an out-of-touch dinosaur despite its rapidly growing Cloud and Big Data businesses - that I've hoped that, at some point, I would see some signs of life.Sadly, I still haven't noticed any; I've discussed before why IBM's financial results suggest it still has no clue how to adapt to a rapidly changing world that has eliminated the value proposition for many of its legacy offerings (middleware, big iron, and so on). As I was reading over a recent transcript of the company's presentation at the J.P. Morgan conference, I may have figured out key one of the reasons why.IBM Doesn't Listen To Its CustomersAt the conference, CFO Martin Schroeter spent a lot of time talking about how awesome IBM's product suite is - and he was so busy talking about the company's perspective on this, that, and the other that he just plain forgot to spend much time going into what critical gaps customers have in their IT infrastructure and what IBM can do to fulfill those needs. The tone was very imperialistic - we're IBM, here's our view of how the world needs to be, and you'll get on board because we're smarter than you.That may work if you're Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and can generate a perpetual premium for slapping a shiny logo on a product, but without that sort of cult brand power (which IBM clearly no longer has), you have to win by actually delivering on customers' expectations. Indeed, contrast the company's self-centered approach to the tone from high-performing, universally well-regarded organizations such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)."
IBM's Next Big Thing,Apr.29.16,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) released its first quarter 2016, earnings few days ago. The company has hinted in its earnings call that it is aiming at expanding its software business by marrying digital intelligence with it. Gradually, a new business model will evolve which I believe will beat Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) cloud leadership. Given that IBM has already built a versatile software portfolio to support the business model, it is highly likely IBM will become the new cloud leader sooner than expected.IBM's new business model is centered on IBM Watson. In the first quarter, the company has taken some significant steps to expand the Watson ecosystem. This article will focus on how Watson is becoming IBM's key product for driving its software business growth.Excerpts from the Earnings CallHere are some excerpts from IBM's first quarter earnings call that I believe are worth pondering over:We're not only transforming our existing businesses but building new markets and addressing new opportunity areas. We're creating Cognitive Solutions that marry digital business with digital intelligence.…We're continuing to expand our Watson ecosystem and reach. Over the last 12 months, the number of developers using Watson APIs is up over 300% and the number of enterprises we've engaged with has doubled."
Why The Market Is Always Wrong About IBM,Jan.27.16,"In each of the past three years I presented similar views on IBM's (NYSE:IBM) revenue development. (You can find my 2012 revenue analysis here, my 2013 analysis here, while 2014 is here.) I also found surprising answers to a few questions the investing community is posing regarding Big Blue's revenues. In fact, since at least three years, the shrinking top line has been the most important concern in the bear camp, while the bull camp always points out that, while revenues have been shrinking, margins have gone up. In the 2014 analysis I could demonstrate why both camps had been wrong in at least one part of their analysis.Now let's see how IBM's segmented revenues developed in 2015 compared to the past nine years:(Chart based on reported segmented data for external revenues.)And here is pre-tax income:Both charts are not 100% correct, as IBM somewhat changed the composition of the GTS and GBS segments in 2015, but the overall trends are not affected and let me anticipate that these charts don't provide a lot of insights anymore, given the huge divestitures that have affected many segments over these years."
IBM: The Strange Case Of The Disappearing Earnings And Revenue Beat,Apr.19.16,"A Masterful Earnings ReleaseNo, I don't mean that the quarter IBM (NYSE:IBM) printed was really good or that shareholders and other stakeholders should be happy. But the earnings release was masterful in attempting to portray a very mediocre set of numbers as something about which to be particularly happy and joyful. Just for the record, IBM reported revenues for Q1 of $18.7 billion, which is down around 4.6% year on year, but was $450 million, or about 2.5% greater than the prior consensus estimates. EPS was reported as $2.35, which fell from the $2.91 reported the prior year. On the other hand, earnings beat the prior consensus EPS forecast of $2.09 by 12%. And while I shall not reprise the balance of the headlines, I'll characterize them as more or less triumphalist and sadly not very realistic in informing either shareholders or any stakeholders with something even close to an evenhanded presentation.Now I agree that expecting evenhanded presentations from companies is more or less like expecting Vladimir Putin deciding to make Russia into a human rights paradise. Not going to happen. There is an old verse from one of my favorite poets, Sir Walter Scott that goes, ""Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive."" The poem is actually about the Battle of Flodden Field, which the Scots lost - great reading particularly the part of young Lochinvar riding out of the west. As the reader will see, IBM's Q1 earnings release was quite a tangled web. But why so harsh on IBM? And why might I have called the earnings release masterful?Before looking at some select portion of lots of numbers in detail, it is important to understand why IBM's shares are down - or at least why I think they are down. Fact is that the company cut guidance materially for earnings performance during the second quarter. The company has reduced its EPS forecast by $.60 from $3.45 to $2.85. Management maintained that somehow its new business structure is less weighted toward Q2 than heretofore. Most investors have seen that kind of shell game before, I imagine, and will wonder if the Q2 guidance reduction reflects more than is immediately apparent. No one really likes back-end loaded years."
Understanding Watson: A Closer Look At IBM's Analytics Powerhouse,Feb. 5.16,"A week ago, Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) research subsidiary DeepMind reported that their latest work in artificial intelligence (AI) was able to beat the infamously complex game of Go. This caused me to write an article that explained what was going on and in which I tried to size up the AI landscape. In the comment section, many readers were interested in a comparison to IBM's (NYSE:IBM) Watson. Further, some found it hard to see the novelty in beating a more complex game when IBM's Deep Blue was able to deliver superhuman chess performance over a decade ago.In this article, I turn to IBM's flagship machine learning/AI project Watson. In the spirit of my previous article, I will try to relay the gist of the science behind it, how it differs from DeepMind's work and what it means for IBM's long-term prospects in the market. This article will not contain any comment towards IBM's share price or earnings, it's purely meant for long-term oriented value investors who want to understand emerging trends in technology.What is Watson?IBM describes the Watson project as follows:IBM Watson is a technology platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to reveal insights from large amounts of unstructured data."
IBM: Will Big Data Analytics + Big Pharma = Big Profits?,Jan.28.16,"What if everyone's health history was recorded and analyzed? What could be done with this information to improve treatment regimens or develop new medicines?A couple of recent pairings are working to answer these questions. IBM (NYSE:IBM) Watson Health announced on December 10, 2015 that it was partnering with Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO). Not much earlier, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Life Sciences (Alphabet) announced on August 31, 2015 that it was partnering with Sanofi (NYSE:SNY). And both Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Novartis (NYSE:NVS) have teamed up with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to take advantage of Amazon Web Services. I take a look at what these partnerships might provide from both the healthcare and revenue standpoints, with a focus on the IBM/Novo Nordisk collaboration.Healthcare ApplicationsWhat can Big Data analytics contribute to healthcare, especially as it relates to Big Pharma? IBM described its Big Data analytics approach to healthcare in a presentation. This summary is representative of how all Big Data analytics services will contribute.In general, Big Data analytics takes large amounts of raw information, distills it into what's needed, and converts it into useful, actionable data. In healthcare, this means taking health records of various sorts along with related ancillary information and finding relationships and trends that can impact health-related decisions. From a patient's perspective, the wealth of information from other people with similar or related conditions can be brought to bear on that individual's specific situational treatment."
"Thanks For The Raise, IBM",May. 8.16,"Another Year, Another RaiseInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) did it again! They gave all their shareholders a raise. The company increased its quarterly dividend by 8% from $1.30 to $1.40 per share. Thanks, IBM! The company, in addition to paying dividends for 100 years, is approaching the quarter century mark as a dividend grower, having grown its dividend payout for 21 years. That's some nice dividend growth. It makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside, although fortunately my doctor says it's not contagious. But IBM's dividend growth is contagious, having more than doubled its dividend in just 6 years. Although these statistics make it easy to tout IBM as one of my favorite dividend growers, there's more than that. My favorite part about IBM's dividend growth is that it's what I consider to be sustainably supported by earnings growth and free cash flow. IBM's dividend payout for 2015 of $5.00/share was supported by $13.42 diluted EPS, a payout ratio of just 37%. Since 2004, IBM has been able to grow its earnings at a compound annual growth rate of 9%, while at the same time growing the dividend at a rate of 18%.Source: IBMEven though the dividend has been growing faster than the company's earnings, IBM will be able to continue this dividend growth for a good while since the current payout ratio is so low.Shrinking Share Count, Growing ValueWhile paying out a robust and growing dividend, IBM has also been focused on returning value to shareholders by a consistent buyback plan. From 2004-2015, the company's share count decreased from 1.71 billion down to 966 million, decreasing at an average rate of 4.6%."
IBM: CEO's Performance Issues Cannot Hurt This Stock,Feb. 2.16,"In my last article on International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), I explained a trading strategy that goes into playing earnings reports. Unfortunately, that strategy would have failed for Q4 earnings, which disappointed IBM stock holders. However, IBM and the tech sector are on the rebound, causing investors to ask whether now is the time to buy (or buy more) IBM.Notwithstanding the clear statistical basis for shorting IBM into Q1 and Q2 earnings, I'm pro IBM. I've been asked to present how I would play IBM as a dividend stock. If you're going for dividends, here's how I would play IBM.Why IBM Is a Great Dividend StockIf you're not already convinced that IBM is a great dividend stock, let me convince you. The bullish case for IBM relies partly on the company's status as a dividend aristocrat. It's raised dividends consistently since 1995:The increase in dividends has matched an increase in stock price for most of IBM's history. Because the stock price increase has outpaced the dividend increase, most of the time, IBM could be considered expensive for the dividend. Only in a brief year-long period of 2008 to 2009 was the stock considered cheap in this regard:"
What IBM Bought With $155 Billion,May.26.16,"Dividends, Buybacks and Shareholder ReturnsInternational Business Machines' (NYSE:IBM) strategy to enhance shareholder returns hinges on a primarily three-pronged approach of dividends, buybacks and reinvestment into the company. The dividends are a direct method of return while the reinvestment allows the company to continue growing earnings. The buybacks are more indirect, and have allowed IBM to bring down its share count from 1.74 billion at the end of 2000 to 962 million at the end of Q1 2016. This reduction of 45% has almost negated the effect of IBM's last 2 for 1 split in 1999. To accomplish this impressive feat the company has spent a gargantuan $155 billion, more than enough to buy the entire company at its current $142 billion market cap. Assuming everything else had stayed the same for IBM since 2000, what might the company look like if it hadn't bought back any shares at all?A Pile of Cash?Had IBM forgone its buybacks, one thing it might still have would be the aforementioned massive $155 billion pile of cash. If IBM had used its cash to pay down debt rather than repurchase shares, what might the company's balance sheet look like? IBM's debt is comprised mainly of Global Financing and Non-Global Financing debt. The Global Financing segment provides funding for IBM's external customers, and charges customers a higher interest rate than the interest rates on its own borrowings. This borrowing is done knowing that it will be eventually repaid with interest. The non-Global Financing debt, ""core debt,"" makes up a much smaller portion of IBM's total debt."
IBM: Is Watson Truly Ushering In The New Era Of Cognitive Computing?,Jan.23.16,"Let's start by defining and explaining the AI effect.Briefly, we humans have a tendency, as soon as computers gain a new capability, to dismiss it as mere brute force computation, rather than recognize any similarity to the human thought process. The best example is the reaction to Deep Blue's victory over world chess champion Gary Kasparov. The interpretation is simple: it was simply a matter of brute force computation. End of story: we humans are still unique in possessing the ability to actually think. Here's a link to a Wikipedia article that develops this concept more fully.Back in the early 1970's, as an underwriter, I pushed a mountain of paper to make decisions to cancel or non-renew personal lines insurance policies. Some agents still typed all their policies. When Allstate started using computers to perform the risk selection function, my superiors dismissed it as template underwriting. College educated males were required to do the underwriting, since both computers and females are inflexible.Fast forward to the present. Travelers (NYSE:TRV) was among the first to make heavy use of analytics to support the underwriting and claims functions. Human beings still make the important decisions, but they are supported by access to massive amounts of interpreted data. Travelers has outperformed the industry for many years.I should mention that Renaissance Technologies, according to Wikipedia, has returned over 35% over a 20-year span in its Medallion fund, run mostly for employees. The firm is now run by two computer scientists specializing in computational linguistics, who joined the company from IBM (NYSE:IBM) Research in 1993. The thought is, possibly their use of sophisticated computer algorithms is enabling the outperformance. Of course it's all brute computation, no match for the human reasoning powers employed by the majority of investors."
IBM's Watson: I'm Worried,Apr. 8.16,"I've been thinking a lot about IBM's (NYSE:IBM) Watson Analytics lately - for those unfamiliar this is referring to IBM's BI (business intelligence) platform. But unfortunately, and it really is a shame, I've been thinking about it in all the wrong ways and under all the wrong thought triggers. I'm worried about Watson Analytics and that should bother those who are long IBM; not specifically that I'm worried about Watson Analytics per se (I mean, who am I to cause any widespread concern?), but that Watson Analytics is causing general worry. Here's why.BI is expected to be a significant 1) general market share driver and 2) ancillary product market share driver for each of the ""ecosystem"" players involved. This list of names right now includes Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP (NYSE:SAP), salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), and obviously IBM. And really I should say general ""data/analytics"" is expected to be the big driver of items #1 and #2 above. But at the companies listed - this is ""likely"" most easily done from a mass market appeal perspective via effective marketing and selling of BI platforms. Take a look at Microsoft's five million-plus subscription platform Power BI for an example of exactly how driving a force BI platforms can be for total ecosystem sales and development (and more importantly for those investing in these names for market cap). I recently detailed how Microsoft is effectively using Power BI as the next great retention driver for its broader (and all-important to Microsoft) productivity suite. Guys, BI platform market share and retention matters. It just does."
IBM's Cloud: Jim Comfort On Competitive Advantages - IBM Exclusive Interview (Part 2),Apr.20.16,"IBM Datacenter in TorontoIn Part 1 of my interview with Dr. James Comfort, IBM's (NYSE:IBM) Chief Technology Officer for Cloud, he spoke about how the company was positioning itself in the industry as a leader in hybrid cloud and how that approach was the one that many enterprise customers would be open to. Click here to see Part 1.In this segment, I ask him about IBM Cloud's competitive advantages and how they are responding to the competition's approach to the market.In order to help follow the thread of the conversation, I have interspersed the interview with my own thoughts, opinions and analysis.Shudeep Chandrasekhar:So, moving on to data centers, over the last 12 months, IBM has been aggressively adding data centers - about five additional data centers in the last one year alone. This is quite an aggressive move. How exactly is IBM leveraging that presence? Is it something for the future that you're planning for now, or is there something specific around that?Jim Comfort:We are building out the distributed model because our model allows us to do that and bring the economics into multiple regions. We were convinced early on that regulatory compliance and data privacy and other enterprise factors would gravitate toward a local model. Local might be within the EU or in the Americas or Canada, so our strategy has been to open multiple datacenters in various regimes that have strong regulatory compliance requirements."
Is IBM's CEO Overpaid?,Feb.19.16,"IBM's (NYSE:IBM) shareholders have faced a rough time over the last years, yet this year IBM's CEO Rometty got a multi-million bonuses. I've read a lot of comments stating this was unjustified, including here on Seeking Alpha. In this article I'll try to examine whether her compensation is indeed unjustified.Virginia Rometty, IBM's CEO, got a $4.5 million bonus for 2015, in addition to $1.6 million in base salary. In addition Rometty got $13.3 million in stock awards, those will be paid out in three years (early 2019). Rometty thus gets total compensation of $19.4 million for 2015, which is an eight percent increase over 2014's total compensation of $17.9 million. Rometty's bonus of $4.5 million was below the company's target of $5.0 million for 2015, which means IBM did not pay out the full bonus this year -- it seems Rometty's results were not as good as they would have to be for her to get the full bonus.IBM produced $13.1 billion in free cash flows in 2015 (up 0.7 billion over the prior year), and paid out $19.4 million to its CEO Rometty. Since we can interpret free cash flows as the payments the company's shareholders get (through dividends and share repurchases), we get to a ratio of 675:1 for shareholder payments to CEO compensation.Let's look at this metric for related tech companies, all with a market capitalization of $120 to $150 billion:Company FCF CEO compensation RatioIntel $10.2 billion $11.2 million 910:1Cisco $11.6 billion $16.8 million 690:1Oracle $11.3 billion $64.0 million 177:1Peer group $33.1 billion $92 million 360:1IBM $13.1 billion $19.4 million 675:1After comparing these three peer companies to IBM, we get to the conclusion that Rometty's payments are below the peer group average. For every $675 generated for the company's owners, Rometty gets $1 in annual compensation, whereas the peer group CEOs get one dollar for every $360 generated for the respective company's owners.We can also look at other metrics:Company Revenue CEO compensation RatioOracle $37 billion $64.0 million 580:1Intel $55 billion $11.2 million 4910:1Cisco $50 billion $16.8 million 2980:1Peer group $142 billion $92.0 million 1540:1IBM $82 billion $19.4 million 4230:1IBM has the second lowest revenue to CEO payment ratio, and its CEO payment relative to the company's revenues is less than half of the peer group average.Company Operating income CEO compensation RatioOracle $13.0 billion $64.0 million 203:1Intel $14.0 billion $11.2 million 1250:1Cisco $12.2 billion $16.8 million 726:1Peer Group $39.2 billion $92.0 million 426:1IBM $15.0 billion $19.4 million 773:1When we look at what portion of each company's operating income is paid to the company's CEO, we see that Rometty's compensation is lower than the average peer group compensation. Rometty's compensation (relative to the company's operating income) is the second lowest after Krzanich's (Intel) compensation.One could argue about CEO compensation being too high in general, but relative to the peer group Rometty's compensation is rather low, she is not overpaid at all.Rometty (and any other CEO) has some influence on some metrics of the company they lead, but some numbers are out of a CEO's reach. Let's look at some of them and how Rometty did there:Revenues: In 2015 IBM's revenues declined one percent (when adjusting for currency rates and divestitures), which isn't a good result per se, but which is not too bad either. Keeping (adjusted) revenues relatively flat is something a lot of companies do, the average for all S&P 500 companies saw sales decline as well (-1.6 percent). When we look per share metrics -- which better reflects the effect of a shrinking share count -- we see that (adjusted) revenues per share are up 1.7 percent over the prior year. As an example: The revenues (theoretically) belonging to a 100 share investment in IBM grew from $8170 to $8340 over the last year. This is not a great result, but not bad either, I believe.Earnings: In 2015 IBM's adjusted net income totaled $14.7 billion, which is a twelve percent decline yoy. 2014's results included one time gains from divestitures though, when we adjust for that net income is down five percent over the prior year's quarter. Earnings per share declined three percent yoy, reflecting the effects of a lower share count. I don't think this result is good, even adjusting for currency and one time gains in 2014 IBM's earnings are down. I can live with revenue decreases as long as earnings go up, but seeing earnings decline doesn't cast a positive light on IBM's leadership.Free cash flows: This, I believe, is the most important number for investors. Free cash flows allow for direct payments towards shareholders via dividends, share repurchases and allow a company to buy in additional growth (by using parts of FCF for acquisitions). In 2015 free cash flows grew six percent to $13.1 billion, which, I believe, is a good result. The company's free cash flow to revenue ratio keeps increasing, and with growing cash flows the company is able to keep shareholder returns high -- ample dividend growth and share repurchases are possible as long as IBM manages to grow free cash flows. Free cash flow per share hit $13.33, which is a new all time high for the company (and an eight percent increase yoy) -- a strong result indeed.We can summarize that IBM's management was able to grow revenues per share very slightly (which is a small positive), whilst earnings per share decreased (which is a negative) and free cash flow per share hit a new all time high (which is a huge positive). All in all IBM's performance (regarding these three metrics) was not bad, and I can live with a compensation increase for Rometty.In fact, Rometty's annual compensation growth rate (eight percent) is exactly as high as IBM's free cash flow per share growth rate (eight percent), which reflects the theoretical compensation for the company's owners.There is one metric investors will be very unhappy with for the prior year (and the years before that), which is the performance of their shares. IBM's shares are down about forty percent from the company's all time high around $210, and those who bought back then will be very unsatisfied with their returns. Unfortunately Rometty does not control the price the market is willing to pay for IBM's shares, she only has some power to influence the company's results regarding revenues, earnings, margins, cash flows etc. Blaming Rometty for the almost twenty percent share price decline we have seen over the last year is not justified, since the price of each share is determined by market forces, not the company's CEO.TakeawayIBM's CEO Rometty got an eight percent compensation increase in 2015, but her compensation is rather low relative to the peer group average.IBM did not do bad fundamentally, and since shareholders saw record free cash flows a compensation increase for IBM's CEO seems fair to me.Shareholders are misdirecting their anger when they blame Rometty for her compensation, IBM's CEO is not doing a bad job and deserves what she earns. The company's share price is not under her control, so blaming her for share price declines is unjustified."
IBM: A New Morgan Stanley Recommendation Based On Exceptionally Tenuous Logic,Feb.19.16,"Introduction:Analyst Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley raised her rating on IBM (NYSE:IBM) shares from equal-weight to over-weight. In addition, The Wall Street Journal Heard on the Street Column printed an article suggesting that IBM shares, because of their valuation and negative analyst sentiment, have nowhere to go but up. Curiously, at least from my perspective, the Morgan Stanley price target for the shares is now $140 which is just a bit more than 5% above the current share price and just $5 greater than the old price target.I'm not sure about how readers might feel about changing a recommendation based on a 4% increase in price target, but to some extent, I have to think that the word ""outperform"" ought to suggest more than a 5% move. To be fair, the shares have increased by 5% today before the announcement of the recommendation. On the other hand, the shares had retraced more than 65% of their most recent downward move in the three-day rally that came to an end this afternoon.IBM is not thought of a particularly volatile stock and indeed, its Beta is 0.66. So the fact is that 5-6% moves in a single day or even over three days are more volatile than many observers might anticipate. There is obviously a fair amount of controversy regarding the prospects of the company in the next couple of years. Again, somewhat remarkably I thought, the Morgan Stanley analysis suggests that IBM is to return to top line growth by 2019. Really! To be fair, the analysis does forecast growth in free cash flow of 2% between this year and 2018. Amazing!"
IBM: Don't Wait For A Miracle,Mar.14.16,"As retail investors, we are taught bad habits from the beginning. We are taught to think like analysts. But what do analysts do? They conduct research and assume they are right. Hence, when the market collapses, the blame is not on them. It is on the markets, and they stick with their convictions. Thinking like a typical analyst exposes you to so many biases. The two most important ones detrimental to your account are listed below.Source: Wikimedia CommonsConfirmation BiasConfirmation Bias looks at information to confirm your initial thesis. I am sure when Berkshire's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) annual report came out, many were at ease when Buffett laid out the reasons for his IBM (NYSE:IBM) purchase.Also, technical analysis seems to be the final resort when a stock slides. Technical analysis used in a siloed format will get you destroyed in the market, but no one seems to care. Even Jim Cramer gets all of these market technicians to explain what is going on. Newsflash, the stock does not know if it is hitting an average.I posted a chart of IBM because I am sure someone will look at this chart and talk about a 200-day bounce.Loss AversionYes, the concept of buying more at a lower price - what I call dollar loss averaging - seems to be the go-to route as IBM's stock continues to fall. Institutions have the money to pour into a losing investment. However, us smaller investors only have limited capital. We cannot act like an institution."
IBM's 4%+ Yield: Bad News... Good News... I Can Wait,Jan.25.16,"International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) recently released fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings. The media headlines were filled with negative tidbits from the report. While that's completely understandable, there were positives underneath that are important to the company's shifting business. But Mr. Market's glass half full reaction is opening an opportunity for dividend investors.Growth and incomeIBM's history goes back nearly 100 years. It has traversed good markets and bad, changing shape along the way to keep up with the trends in the technology space. It's impossible to predict which companies can stand the test of time, but IBM has proven it has the chops to do so. In fact, I think the changes it's making today are in its DNA.Which is one of the big reasons why the company passes my most important screen: Would I be happy with my wife owning this company if I were to die. I'm confident IBM will continue to reinvest itself time and time again, as it has in the past. So my wife wouldn't need to worry about it. And, as one of the largest and most profitable technology companies, she shouldn't have to worry about solvency.But that's just one screen. Like many income investors, I have minimum requirements for yield. And until recently, IBM didn't pass muster. Now, with a yield of more than 4%, it does. That, of course, is backed up by a long history of regular dividend increases - another requirement. So not only would I expect my wife to be safe holding IBM, but I'd expect her to get regular ""pay hikes"" along the way."
IBM: Making Money With Watson,May.10.16,"I've written a couple of articles about IBM's (NYSE:IBM) Watson. The company was kind enough to offer me an inside look at the technology at their Watson Experience center in New York City not too long ago and it was a real eye opener for me. Still, while the technology was impressive overall, the real issue is how does the company make money with it? Here's some of what it's working on...Digging deepAs my first two articles went into, Watson is about enabling people to interact with data in a new way. Importantly in a more human way that is augmented by an ability to quickly parse data to find insights that would be hard to do without a digital assist.The core example provided on my tour was about a sick little boy who went to his doctor, wound up in the emergency room, and then got admitted to the hospital because no one could figure out what was wrong with him. It took six days to make the proper diagnosis, and that only came about because a nurse happened to notice a symptom she had seen before. The child is alive today because of a lucky coincidence, in my eyes.IBM recreated that process with Watson helping the doctors along. The child still wound up in the ER, but things changed dramatically from there. That's because Watson, like the nurse, knew about the condition the child had. But, interestingly, it wasn't the first round pick, if you will. Watson offered up other illnesses as more likely based on the information that it had. Probabilities are a core part of what Watson is all about."
IBM's Quantum Leap,May. 4.16,"A funny comic I once read said that if a technology is ""about a decade away,"" it remains '""about a decade away"" indefinitely. If you search your memory, you might find this to be true for a cure for cancer, practical applications of graphene or the elusive quantum computing. Nevertheless, eventually leaps happen. Diseases are cured. Cars drive themselves. Man lands on the moon. The hard part from the outside is to differentiate true progress towards a practical application from what amounts to a university press office hyping up a proof-of-concept paper.This week, IBM (NYSE:IBM) announced the IBM quantum experience. My article is meant to provide perspective on this announcement for IBM investors.Preliminary commentI will be honest with you: As a computer scientist, my focus is on machine learning and cloud computing. I am far from an expert in quantum algorithms, which is currently a very theoretical branch of computer science. I can understand the concepts of quantum algorithm papers but I wouldn't know the first thing about the concrete mechanics of engineering one, so excuse my superficial explanations of the physics.The quantum computing promiseI believe many readers will have a relatively vague idea of quantum physics that might include some conceptions about uncertainty and dead cats. Most will you might also have read about quantum computing here and there as the end to current encryption mechanisms and other seemingly magical promises."
IBM Challenged Intel's Memory Technology,May.24.16,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) has announced that its scientists have demonstrated a high-caliber data-storing method using a relatively new memory technology, known as PCM (phase-change memory). Mainstream media is saying that IBM's memory technology can be a potential threat for Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) 3D XPoint (pronounced crosspoint) technology in the long run.Intel, in association with Micron (NASDAQ:MU), announced in 2015 that it developed 3D XPoint, a breakthrough memory technology, which will become the new memory standard. Intel's XPoint-based Optane SSDs (solid-state drives) are due for release this year. Can IBM's new technology adversely affect Optane sales? In the long run, no.IBM Challenged Intel's 3D XPoint TechnologyIf IBM plans to commercially exploit the PCM memory technology right away, Intel's Optane sales might suffer temporarily. IBM said that its research team has showed how to reliably store 3 bits of data per cell using PCM technology. PCM is a non-volatile RAM, which uses a chalcogenide material to store data. Earlier IBM's scientists as well as scientists from other institutions showed that PCM can store 1 bit of data per cell.Dr. Haris Pozidis, manager of non-volatile memory research at IBM, said:""Reaching 3 bits per cell is a significant milestone because at this density the cost of PCM will be significantly less than DRAM and closer to flash.""In light of Dr. Pozidis' comment, I believe IBM will kick off mass production of cost-effective and highly-durable SSDs in a year or so, challenging Intel's 3D XPoint-based Optane SSDs. With the new era of memory-driven computing ushering in, there are definite use cases for both memory technologies, particularly in areas where either large memory capacity or high-speed storage is an absolute necessity, such as machine learning, genome sequencing and climate modeling, to name a few. In the long run, however, the superior technology will prevail."
IBM's Cloud: Jim Comfort On Cloud Strategy - IBM Exclusive Interview (Part 1),Apr.19.16,"In my continuing pursuit of understanding IBM's (NYSE:IBM) key business verticals of cloud, big data and analytics, I recently had the privilege of interviewing Inhi Cho Suh, General Manager of Collaboration Solutions. I covered several aspects of what we discussed on the call about their predictive analytics business, the adoption of analytics-as-a-service and the growth of Bluemix as a key driver of developer engagement. I've linked that interview article below:IBM Exclusive Interview Series 1: Inhi Cho Suh On The Future Of Analytics As A ServiceLast week, I had the pleasure of interviewing Dr. James H. Comfort, Chief Technology Officer for Cloud at IBM.During the call, we talked through many of IBMs strategies and initiatives for their cloud business, which brought in $10.2 billion in total revenues in 2015.The Q&A transcript below covers much of that discussion and is condensed to its essential components, along with a final analysis by me.The entire interview has been divided into three articles (to be published in sequence), as follows:IBM Cloud growth strategy and the competition from AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)Data center footprint advantage and IBM's messaging to clientsIBM's initiatives with developers - Bluemix, Watson and IBM InterConnect conferences"
Is IBM Telling A (Big) White Lie With Watson?,Feb.17.16,"FUD. It stands for Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt. It's a bluff a company plays when it doesn't have the technology cards to win.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) played the FUD game masterfully in the 1980s, holding the market in abeyance for half a decade while it worked to make Windows work half as well as the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Macintosh had in 1984.FUD only works if you can, in time, deliver the goods. IBM (NYSE:IBM), in talking about a ""cognitive era"" in computing, can't.IBM's FUD is built around Watson, a natural language front-end for cloud systems that it demonstrated a decade ago, and around which it is now trying to re-build the company. Watson translates queries into big data commands, the way Hadoop does with software programs.But to actually work, Watson commands have to become their own language. That's because human languages are fuzzy, unpredictable, and natural language queries are often ill-defined. An executive may ask, ""Tell me what my competitors are doing,"" but a straight answer may not exist. The question has to be broken into pieces, and various queries made of publicly-available information, before anything like an answer can be generated.IBM knows this. IBM itself is turning Watson into something more like a computer language, with a host of ""dev tools"" designed to transform how programmers interact with Watson into a computer language.But if Watson is a language, it's not a natural one. Computers demand precision. Even the best reporters, like Adrian Bridgewater, still have trouble understanding and explaining what this means. But their spidey sense is tingling, and they know, as IBM knows, that Watson is going to be a tool for programmers. It's not what commercials with Bob Dylan claim it is, a way for computers to communicate directly with people, except in the most rudimentary way."
A Closer Look At IBM's Future (Part 1),Aug. 4.16,"In my previous article, I explained why I believe in the future of IBM. Over the last month, the stock price moved from $152 to the current level of $160: a gain of 5.2% against +2.8% for the S&P 500. This strong performance is driven by IBM's strategic turnaround in which the company is selling underperforming assets to focus on its ""strategic imperatives.""After I published my previous article, I was contacted by the ""Corporate Communications and External Relations"" team at IBM, offering me the chance to learn more about the company and its activities. I asked the readers of Seeking Alpha what they would be interested to know and IBM started responding. First of all, I tried to understand the long-term vision of IBM.Second, I tried to understand how IBM intends to position itself vis-à-vis technologies that are likely to shape our futures. In particular, I focused on two technologies that I believe will considerably impact our future: quantum computing and self-driving cars (read this article if you are interested in the technologies that can significantly affect your retirement plans). This is the first part of the information that I have received from the company.Q: What will IBM become in 5/10 years?A: IBM is emerging as a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company. You can look at the investments IBM is making, both organically (such as R&D) and acquisitions (11 already this year) and you'll see that much of our investment activity is focused on cognitive and cloud capabilities. The company believes big data, cognitive systems and cloud computing will influence and transform the way companies do business."
What's The Value Of IBM's 'Strategic Imperatives' Segment?,Nov.10.16,"With a $147 billion market cap and price/revenue ratio of just 1.84, the lowest among tech giants, it seems investors are not buying IBM's (NYSE:IBM) story of growth transition. I don't see a reason for this - after all numbers talk.IBM's third-quarter cloud revenue was $3.4 billion, higher than the $3.2 billion figure AWS recorded. However, analysts and investors are rewarding cloud sectors for companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) with high multiples while neglecting IBM's cloud, punishing it with utility-like multiples.I believe that ""IBM Facing Revenue Decline"" headline is pushing investors to focus on the empty side of the glass while missing the valuable growth part of the company.In this article, I will try to get an approximate valuation of IBM's ""Strategic Imperatives"" segment by valuing each segment as a standalone company. But first, I will give a quick justification for why the stock is mispriced by investors.Why IBM stock is mispricedAll those following IBM know the main driver of its stock price fall - decreasing revenue. Although revenues managed to stabilize in the last four quarters, accompanied with the company shifting its focus into promising sectors, multiples (like low PE ratio) show investors are valuing IBM as a no-growth stock.This shows investors' skepticism about the transition, postponing any move into the stock until the sky is clear. Personally, I believe in IBM's ability to transform itself. After all, we are talking about a tech company that was founded more than 100 years ago, and managed historically to follow tech frenzies effectively.However, investing in a company facing transformation is a risky bet. Especially when the sector it is transforming into is facing intense competition from players with deep pockets. In case IBM failed in its growth strategy, its stock can be ""extremely"" damaged, since its valuation will be based entirely on revenue declining sectors."
IBM's Watson Has Already Failed,Sep. 6.16,"As a reader of Seeking Alpha, I've seen several posts about IBM's (NYSE:IBM) Watson Artificial Intelligence technology and how Watson is an important differentiator that will drive IBM's growth in coming years. You can read such posts here, here and here. Unfortunately for IBM, these SA writer conclusions appear to me to be precisely wrong. I fear Watson is already a major failure for Big Blue.First, let's set the scene. I found a very useful Watson timeline showing the technology began in 2008, but its Jeopardy win on TV didn't come until 2011. At that point, IBM announced that it would turn Watson into both a product and a service within two years. And by 2013, Watson-related news stories were saying IBM was already targeting healthcare and customer service with many other segments to follow as Watson morphed from a supercomputer application to the IBM cloud.IBM notably announced a $1 billion investment in Watson in 2013 as well as a $100 million fund to promote third-party Watson development. Given that these announcements were five years after the first Watson news, three years after the Jeopardy win, and took place at the tony East Village address IBM CEO Ginni Rometty said was Watson's new headquarters, I think we can date Watson's commercial debut from that time.It is now three years later still. Watson has been around in some form for eight years, and the creation of IBM's Watson business unit was three years ago. So is Watson a success?It's very difficult to tell from IBM's reported financials whether Watson is a success or not. As I have already reported, the way IBM segments its revenue makes it difficult to see whether the company's so-called strategic initiatives are making money. This is especially the case for Watson, whose results are not only mixed up with revenue decidedly not from what IBM calls Cognitive Computing: IBM also splits Watson revenue across two different segments. So while IBM continues to talk a good game for Watson, it isn't at all clear whether Watson is delivering much in the way of sales."
A Closer Look At IBM's Future (Part 2) - IBM Watson,Sep. 2.16,"This article is part of a series of interviews with IBM. In my first article, I praised the company's turnaround. After I published that article, I was contacted by the ""Corporate Communications and External Relations"" team at IBM, who offered me the chance to learn more about the company and its activities. I asked readers of Seeking Alpha what they would be interested to know, and IBM started responding.In the first part of my interview, I tried to understand the long-term vision of the firm, how IBM intends to position itself vis-à-vis technologies that are likely to shape our futures. In particular, I focused on two technologies: quantum computing and self-driving cars.Over the course of two articles, I will elaborate on Watson, IBM's cognitive system. In today's article, I start with the company's corporate team (thank you, Melissa) answering my questions. I then had the chance to dig deeper and have a conversation with Rob High, IBM Fellow and chief technology officer of Watson. Rob has been very kind and took the time to guide me through Watson and its infrastructure. Follow my next articles if you are interested in reading more about Watson and the interview with Rob.On the IBM website, Watson is defined as ""a technology platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to reveal insights from large amounts of unstructured data."" Being a researcher myself, I was particularly curious about how Watson exactly works. When I conduct my own empirical research, I input a series of data into my statistical program and then run a regression to see how a certain variable x impacts a variable y. The statistical program simply looks at the correlation between the two and tells me how they are related to each other. For example, if I tell the computer that when I study five hours I get 50% correct answers, and when I study six hours I get 60%, the computer will be able to predict the % of correct answers for any level of study time (it is never as simple as that, but you get the gist)."
IBM And SoftLayer: Is A $3 Billion Write-Off Looming?,Nov.23.16,"(Editors' note: As raised in a dispute, IBM only allocated $1.3B in goodwill to SoftLayer at time of acquisition; the author's $3B figure refers to purported carrying value for SoftLayer as a whole, after post-acquisition investment).Ten years ago, Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) began offering cloud services, and soon thereafter, the company unabashedly proclaimed, ""In the fullness of time… computing is moving to the cloud.""Amazon's ""everything-to-the-cloud"" enthusiasm caught a lot of people by surprise, and it was met with plenty of skepticism. Not surprisingly, it was heresy to the likes of IBM (NYSE:IBM), seller of expensive hardware such as its zSeries mainframes.After all, IBM had turf to protect. Cloud data centers are not built around IBM technology, so if everything moved to the cloud - what would IBM sell?Ten years later, it's clear: Amazon appears to have been right. Pretty much everything is moving to the cloud. The cloud is cheaper, faster, more secure1, and, in our opinion, there's really no solid argument for staying with the inefficient and expensive hardware and software of the on-premise computing past.The problem for IBM: It got a late start on the public cloud.Look at IBM annual reports in 2011 and 2012 and you'll see CEO Ginni Rometty casually dismiss cloud, barely mentioning the word in each of her first two letters. The planning and priority of IBM management back then, if you'll recall, revolved around a $20 earnings per share ""road map,"" a much ballyhooed 2015 earnings goal.The realization finally came in 2013, seven years after Amazon launched its cloud business that, indeed, cloud computing is the future - and that future is already here. In our view, the company then made a hurried buy of SoftLayer in mid-2013 to get in on some sweet cloud infrastructure action. They shelled out $2 billion, then went in hard with an investment of another billion dollar, bringing their total to a cool $3 billion."
A Glimmer Of Hope For IBM,Oct.31.16,"If you have read my other Seeking Alpha posts on IBM (NYSE:IBM) you'll know I have serious doubts about current management, which seems to be gliding the company toward oblivion. Sales are dropping, the company is shrinking, and the stories being told about new product categories like Cloud Computing and Watson (artificial intelligence) replacing lost revenue just aren't coming true. Yet I have to admit that IBM has made a few good hires lately.IBM Names First-Ever Chief Marketing Officer - IBM's first chief marketing officer is Michelle Peluso, the former chief executive of flash-sale site Gilt, now part of the Hudson Bay Company. The company formerly had senior leaders of its marketing efforts, but the CMO title is new. Peluso will report to Jon Iwata, IBM's senior vice president for marketing and communications.IBM's chief digital officer Bob Lord says the company is changing its ""mindset"" so it can appeal to startups and developers - When Bob Lord announced he was leaving AOL in November last year, most people knew he was going to end up landing a big new role - not least because he told The Wall Street Journal he wanted to run a public company or a company about to IPO. Well, Lord is now at IBM, in the newly-created chief digital officer role. Lord hasn't quite replaced Ginni Rometty to run the company, but he has been charged with transforming Big Blue into a much slicker operation that he hopes will appeal as much to Silicon Valley techies as its traditional enterprise customers.IBM hires veteran Intel executive Rani Borkar - IBM has hired former Intel Vice President Rani Borkar to help lead a chip architecture initiative called OpenPOWER. Borkar spent 27 years at Intel, leaving last year as one of the company's top executives in charge of architecture for key classes of chips used in PCs and data centers. She also serves on Oregon State University's board of trustees."
Microsoft Vs. IBM: Here's Which Dividend Growth Powerhouse You Should Buy Right Now,Oct.27.16,"Both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) are well loved dividend growth blue chips, and for good reason. IBM has been paying a dividend every quarter for 100 years, while Microsoft has grown its payout by 13% CAGR since it started paying dividends in 2003.MSFT Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts"
IBM Is Headed Toward $200 A Share,Jul.11.16,"We sold IBM (NYSE:IBM) and a few other equities a number of few weeks back as I wanted to plough more capital into precious metals for the elevation portfolio. This trade has worked out very well but I still believe stocks are a good place to be at present as the market clearly looks like it is being protected. Just look at the V shaped rally the market underwent a few days after the Brexit vote. The market (NYSEARCA:SPY) is up almost 5% since we bottomed on the 27th of June and IBM has followed suit. What is relevant here is that I believe we printed an intermediate cycle low in equity markets on the 27th. What does this mean? Well what this means is that because we ran under the previous daily cycle low and sentiment hit an extreme, in all probability we are in the initial innings of an intermediate cycle which means higher prices are ahead of us.The S&P 500 and the Dow look certain to break out to new highs any day now. The Nasdaq will undoutedly follow. IBM has easily outperformed equity markets this year and I believe this trend will continue. Why?Well even after its 12%-plus rally this year, IBM still appeals to me as a value play. Its earnings and sales multiple of 11.7 and 1.9 respectively are still below its historic averages and its price to cash flow ratio is well under 10 (something I look for in value plays). Furthermore dividend growth has been robust in recent years and the company raised again to $1.4 per quarter back in May. Yes debt has increased at the company especially since 2012 which has lifted the debt to equity ratio to 2.7 but the company brought in $13.43 billion in free cash flow last year. Many bears focus on rising debt and decreasing revenues and never research the good things that are happening under the hood at this company.Many bearish analysts consistently focus on the 14 straight quarters of reducing revenue but fail to see how fast the company's Strategic Imperatives are growing. Furthermore gross margins are well up on 2011 when the company almost brought in $107 billion in revenues. Suffice to say that there was more than $25 billion between the company's top line in 2011 and 2016 but the bottom line only reported $10 billion of difference. There's even a smaller percentage difference between free cash flow levels in the above mentioned years. Are we to continually watch revenue counts or are profits and margins more important? I focus on the latter which is why the payout ratio is holding firm below 40%.I have stated before that the dollar is about to enter a multi-year bear market and IBM is well positioned to take advantage as it derives more than half of its sales from international operations. As the chart shows below, we did technical damage to the dollar index when we pierced right through the 94 level. I see us rallying to max the 98 level before we roll over once more.."
IBM Vs. Microsoft: The Best Way To Profit From Blockchain,Aug. 5.16,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) launched its Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform on Bluemix earlier this year in February. The service allows developers to create blockchain applications on the IBM Cloud. Recently the company announced a cloud service in a secure environment for blockchain networks. In addition to IBM, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also launched its BaaS platform on Azure in November last year.Both IBM and Microsoft have jumped on the blockchain bandwagon by offering BaaS on their respective cloud network. Blockchain is far from mainstream, and it will take time for a widely acceptable industry standard to emerge. Investors, who are interested to profit from the nascent blockchain technology, can invest in either IBM or Microsoft (or both). However, I believe that IBM's simple yet robust blockchain initiative has made the company ideal for profiting from the blockchain revolution.How Blockchain Can Revolutionize Business?Blockchain, the underlying technology of Bitcoin, is a peer-to-peer technology that can permanently record transactions on a distributed ledger. A transaction or a set of transactions constitutes a block, which is placed in the blockchain in a linear and chronological order. Once the transaction is over, the block is complete and a new block is ready to be created. In order to remain connected with the previous block, the new block contains a hash of the previous block. The ledger is called distributed because it resides across a network of servers instead of a single server with multiple replicas. The recorded transactions aren't erasable, and for modifying a particular transaction another compensating transaction is required."
Will IBM Stop Raising Its Dividend?,Aug. 3.16,"We are on a mission to build the ultimate yield portfolio, follow us for regular updates on classic yield names like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), as well as consistent high yield equities you've likely never heard of. This is a one-stop shop for income investors looking to protect their dividend income streams from dreaded yield reductions, and discover new gems for their income portfolios.Use of Cash: The use of cash test provides a visual overview of the various cash uses that a company has been allocating cash towards. It shows the relative size of the cash uses versus the outstanding cash balance available to the company. It is a quick and simple way to view how the company has used its cash over the past 10 years, and is indicative of what the company may do in the next 10 years with its cash reserves. We examine dividend payments to all shareholders (including payments to preferred dividend holders) as well as net repurchases which includes equity issued via stock option plans, etc… as well as interest payments on debt; this offers a more wholesome view of how the company allocates capital."
IBM: The Power Of 10 Shares A Year,Dec. 5.16,"Everyone knows intuitively that the earlier you start investing the better. We've all seen the ""magic"" examples of a young 20-year old compounding a small amount of funds over a 40- or 50-year investing lifetime. Those are great illustrations. However, they can be a bit abstract.With that in mind, I continue to look at what results you can pile up during even intermediate time frames. Let's take a look at IBM (NYSE:IBM) - a company that has taken a ton of flak for slow growth during a good part of this decade - to get a better feel for what I mean.The last time IBM had a ""frozen"" dividend was from the third quarter of 1993 through the first quarter of 1996. Thereafter, the company has been increasing its dividend by a solid and consistent rate. There were two stock splits leading up to the dot.com bubble - one in 1997 and another in 1999.I'm not going to ""cherry pick"" this example - let's start with a particularly poor time to start thinking about an investment in IBM. At the end of 1999, shares of IBM were trading around $108. The company was earning $3.70 or so per share and paying out $0.47 per share in cash dividends. Those numbers equate to a starting yield of 0.44% and a valuation of 29 times earnings.Given that the yield is now north of 3% and the earnings multiple is down to 11 or 12 times profits, you can guess that an investment from that point of 1999 has not performed particularly well (something like a 3% or 4% annual rate). And this single piece of information is the type of thing that the media likes to fixate on: IBM from 1999 to today was a subpar investment.Yet that type of thinking ignores reality (and indeed, ignores the goals of many investors). We don't just invest once and sit on our hands; instead we invest regularly and over a great deal of time. For this example, I wanted to focus on how seemingly small investments can grow to sizable cash flows."
Can IBM Win The Storage War Against Dell-EMC?,Aug.29.16,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) has launched its new Storwize all-flash storage portfolio targeted at enterprises that run cloud or cognitive applications and workloads. The company also announced its ""Flash In"" storage migration program to help enterprises migrate to its all-flash storage platform from the platform of privately held Dell and EMC (NYSE:EMC), the companies that are going to merge this fall. As a result of this mega merger, Dell will be able to focus on the enterprise storage marketplace, an area where EMC enjoys the leadership position.IBM is playing an opportunistic game here. Many people including storage customers are anticipating that a smooth transition toward a unified company isn't something Dell and EMC will experience post merger. IBM's plan is to grab a part of the market share of Dell-EMC via its ""Flash In"" migration program. I believe this is a rare opportunity for IBM to boost its storage market share and Big Blue is heading in the right direction by targeting cloud or cognitive computing customers.Changing Storage Industry Dynamics: IBM's OpportunityDynamics in the storage industry is changing fast, creating revenue growth opportunities for big storage vendors. Let's first focus on how the storage industry dynamics are changing.Flash storage and hybrid devices are fast replacing spinning disks in datacenters.The two primary determinants of purchasing storage devices of yesteryear, speed and scalability, no longer solely influence purchasing decisions.The ability of a storage system to allow users to apply real-time analytics at speed and scale is fast becoming the third decisive factor.Role of software is assuming greater importance in the functioning of modern storage devices."
"IBM's Deborah DiSanzo, GM Watson Health, On IBM's Healthcare Initiatives",Jun.28.16,"About nine months ago, IBM (NYSE:IBM) made a very key strategic acquisition. No, it was not Merge Healthcare Inc. or even the more recent Truven Health Analytics. It was Deborah DiSanzo, General Manager for IBM Watson Health.Watson Health stands out among CEO Ginny Rometty's several strategic imperatives because it is changing and facilitating healthcare systems not only in developed countries but in emerging markets as well, on a massive scale.The urgent need for better, more transparent and more efficient healthcare systems around the world - even in the United States - puts Watson Health in an enviable position. And Deborah DiSanzo has been hand-picked by Rometty to drive IBM's vision forward in the healthcare analytics space.With that, I introduce to you IBM's General Manager for Watson Health, and former CEO of Philips Healthcare, Deborah DiSanzo:Shudeep Chandrasekhar: Probably the first thing I would like to know is: Why Healthcare IT as a first choice for Watson, I mean you know there are larger pots within manufacturing and natural resources for example which I believe is estimated at a half a billion dollar industry - the IT part alone - so why specifically healthcare?"

At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Today’s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.Now, I’ll turn the meeting over to Miss Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma’am, you may begin.Patricia MurphyThank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President Investor Relations for IBM. I’m here today with Martin Schroeter, IBM’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I’d like to welcome you to our second quarter earnings presentation. The prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.I’ll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the company’s filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM website, or from us in Investor Relations.Our presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to their related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You’ll find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.So with that, I’ll turn the call to Martin Schroeter.Martin SchroeterThanks, Patricia. In the second quarter, we generated $20.2 billion in revenue, $3.5 billion in pre-tax income and $2.95 of operating earnings per share.Ninety days ago, we told you what we expected for the second quarter. We said we’d continue to see strength in the strategic imperatives and we delivered 12% revenue growth led by cloud. We said we’d continue to build as-a-service capabilities. Our cloud-as-a-service revenue was up 50% and we exited the quarter with an annual run rate of $6.7 billion in our cloud-as-a-service businesses. That’s up from $5.4 billion last quarter. Certainly we have a benefit from the acquisitions recently closed but we has solid organic growth as well.We said we’d continue a high level of investment as we move into new areas and build new markets, and we did that both organically and through acquisitions. And we said that, given seasonality and actions we took in the first quarter, we’d grow our pre-tax income by about $2 billion quarter to quarter, and we grew a bit more than that. In total, we got done what we set out to do and we saw some improvements in trajectory relative to long-term trends, though, as always, the rate and pace varied by business unit and geography.Let me touch quickly on some of the drivers for the quarter. As I said, we continued to deliver double-digit revenue growth in our strategic imperatives. Over the last 12 months, strategic imperatives delivered $31 billion in revenue, and now represent 38% of IBM. Growth was led by cloud, where our revenue was up 30% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, and over $11.5 billion over the last year so good progress in cloud. Looking at revenue from a segment perspective, the strongest growth came from cognitive solutions led by our analytics and cognitive capabilities and security."
IBM's Turnaround Shows Little Promise,Jul.22.16,"We can argue about whether IBM's (NYSE:IBM) earnings announced this week are better or worse, but for those investors who have bought and held here is what's actually happening at IBM and the likely end game that will result. It is not pretty.IBM has focused its efforts mostly on the biggest companies in the world. They are the ones that can pay IBM's high prices. The other 90 percent of the IT market is largely ignored by IBM though it accounts for 10x more in total IT spending. Amazon and Microsoft are catering to these firms and because of the size of this market they are enjoying enormous economies of scale. Amazon and Microsoft have built huge ecosystems around their services. So it will be easier for Amazon and Microsoft to go after IBM's big customers than it will be for IBM to play in the bigger market.There's nothing IBM can do at this point to gain a respectable share of the cloud or any CAMSS (cloud, analytics, mobile, social, security) market, which is why current earnings show at best flat growth. They are too late, too far behind, and too investment averse to catch up. IBM's best hope is to give the illusion they are relevant and hope that will buy the time they need to find new business opportunities.Let's be clear: IBM has irreparably damaged their core businesses. Many writers covering this company fail to understand the depth of damage already inflicted. IBM's corporate culture is too lethargic, there is no empowerment or delegation of authority, the future businesses cannot generate the business needed to sustain the company in its present form. This is all because current leadership is horribly out of touch with the times and the state of technology."
Is IBM Buying Back Shares With Funds That Should Have Been Devoted To R&D?,Dec.22.16,"Here's what got me going. It's taken from an article originating on InvestorPlace and published by Kiplinger.As Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha explained in a recent research report, International Business Machines has spent a sizable fortune on buybacks of IBM stock in recent years, but that has led to led to ""an underinvestment in R&D.""For perspective, the number of shares outstanding has fallen from 1.115 billion in 2012 to 957 million as of the most recently reported quarter. At the same time, the company's research and development expense was $4.4 billion for the past four quarters, versus a total R&D expenditure of $6.3 billion in 2012.This certainly reads like a damning indictment of IBM's management. However, an examination of the facts demonstrates that the criticism is invalid.Taking a Closer LookIBM has a set policy of spending 6% of revenue on R&D. From the most recent 10-K:IBM annually invests approximately 6 percent of total revenue for R&D, focusing on high-growth, high-value opportunities.What the critics elect to ignore is that R&D has remained consistent at approximately 6% of revenue. IBM divested its Microelectronics (Chip) business since it lacked appropriate scale to compete with the likes of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and TSMC (NYSE:TSM).

Is There Another Bribery Case Brewing In IBM Poland?,Nov.30.16,"At first, the gifts seemed innocent enough: a free dinner and a private helicopter tour over the Grand Canyon. By the end of it, though, the Polish official was standing in a Warsaw parking lot, accepting $100,000 in bags of cash, given to him in exchange for multi-million-dollar government contracts.You might be thinking that this government employee was being paid off by the mafia or some shadowy military contractor, but think again: According to the SEC and Polish prosecutors, the official was allegedly bribed by white-collar executives within Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), the American blue chip technology firms.In 2014, the SEC charged HP with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in Poland. At the time, the agency explained HP executives ""provided gifts and cash bribes worth more than $600,000 to a Polish government official to obtain contracts with the national police agency.""source: SEC - hereBut after four years, in our view, regulators have taken no significant action on IBM to dissuade this type of behavior. For investors, bribery allegations against a company are incredibly important. It's a signal that the company might have an inferior product and it's struggling to compete in the marketplace.Worse, it may also mean that the company has weak internal controls in place - which should really send shivers down your spine. Let me explain.Corporate Quid-Pro-QuoIt all began in the fall of 2006 when Andrejz Machnacz, the Polish official identified by the investigative news site ProPublica, traveled to a conference in San Francisco. Machnacz held an important role within the Polish government: He controlled billions of dollars in government IT contracts and he apparently wasn't all that interested in playing by the rules."
IBM: What More Does The Market Want?,Oct.19.16,"IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM) reported earnings on October 17th. The stock price promptly fell 3%. But here's the thing - the earnings report was actually pretty good. If good news is bad news, what is it that investors are looking for?A solid beatAnalysts watching IBM were looking for the company to bring in $19 billion in revenues and to report adjusted earnings of $3.23 a share in the third quarter. The over 100-year old computer giant beat on both accounts, reporting $19.2 billion on the top line and $3.29 in adjusted earnings per share. And investors were clearly displeased with the stock falling 3% while the broader market advanced.The truth is, the underlying numbers have been pretty good at IBM. For example, revenues in the so-called strategic imperatives have advanced 16% so far this year. These are the businesses on which IBM is focusing for the future, including cloud, analytics, mobility and security. It's exactly where you want to see double-digit growth. And the new ""hot"" sector, cloud computing, has put up astounding numbers, growing roughly 65% so far this year. Overall, about 40% of the company's revenues are now derived from this collection of businesses.But this wasn't enough to keep investors happy. To be fair, IBM shares are up nearly 10% so far this year even after a recent pullback. That's roughly twice the market's around 5% gain. So, perhaps the stock decline on decent earnings has more to do with the above market gain than anything else. Still, this appears to be a ""good news is bad news"" situation.Slow turnThe fact is, IBM remains a company in transition. And it will continue to be a company in transition for a while longer. Essentially, it is working to reposition itself for a future that is very different from the past. If IBM were a $1 billion market cap company that's been around for a decade or less, you'd expect such a shift to be quick - like turning a small sailboat. But this is a $140 billion market cap company that has been around for 100 years. Making changes at a company as big as IBM is like turning a giant cruise ship capable of holding thousands of people."
IBM Is Set For The Next 10 Years,Dec. 7.16,"IBM's (NYSE:IBM) dividend yield is 3.4% and the IT behemoth looks ready to boost its payout in 2017. The company has been reinventing itself for the last few years by means of acquisitions and strategic partnerships. Still, despite spending billions on acquisitions, IBM is a cash flow engine. It's like the company is printing money in the back room. The money-making engine is expected to generate $12 billion in free cash flow for 2016.The company's goal is growth through acquisitions, as IBM positions itself as the leader in cloud computing and cognitive computing. The third-quarter report of 2016 marked IBM's eighteenth uninterrupted quarter without revenue growth. At the same time, the company has maintained its track record of payouts for one-hundred years, increasing the payouts over the last twenty-one years.In 2016, IBM paid out 44.6% of its free cash flow, $5.35 billion. Right now, IBM's quarterly dividend sits at $1.40. In 2006, IBM's quarterly dividend was $0.30. You can see that the increase over the last ten years has been significant. The fact that IBM ranks dividends high on its priority list was emphasized by CFO Martin Schroeter, when he stated, ""We will absolutely continue to grow the dividend, and then to the extent that we have excess capital to return, we will return it. And over the long term, that number from a share repurchase would be a 2% to 3% reduction.""In other words, IBM will continue to spend billions on buybacks every year.Now, what makes me think IBM is ready to begin revenue growth? First, according to Schroeter, in 2017, IBM will be reducing what Schroeter called ""remixing skills."" Second, IBM's acquisition of Sanovi Technologies confirms IBM's dominance in the hybrid cloud. Third, in September 2016, IBM launched its AI deep learning server, the only server that utilizes Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) NVLink technology. Fourth, on December 6, IBM launched a new cloud service called Bluemix Continuous Delivery, a tool for DevOps integration. Fifth, IBM Watson Health has hooked up with Siemens Radiology and In Vitro Diagnostics to aid physicians in making faster and more precise diagnoses."
"Forecast - Cloudy: IBM, Watson And The Quantum Experience",Jun. 9.16,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) is a company in transition. On the one hand, there are reorganizations and layoffs as the blue giant is transforming itself into a cloud-services company. On the other hand, there are flagship research projects such as Watson or the Quantum Experience as a foreshadowing of things to come in the next few years. I recently had the opportunity to ask IBM some questions about these projects and other things on my mind. This article contains said questions and IBM's answers.Since my questions cover multiple research and product divisions at IBM, I did not interview a single person but rather had my questions forwarded to the relevant people. Readers are welcome to comment with more questions.Q: Let's begin by talking about IBM's cloud strategy. IBM has a large number of cloud services from the Watson cloud to SoftLayer, IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. Where do you see IBM's specific strengths?A: As you can imagine, we have a lot to say regarding cloud. The first phase of cloud was characterized by migration of IT to the cloud. This phase is still happening, with companies at varying stages on the migration path. IBM has participated fully in this phase of cloud and has built a $10.8 billion cloud business by understanding how to help clients take their existing IT infrastructure and move it into the cloud. The next phase of cloud will be about new innovation and competitive advantage. IBM works with the world's most recognized brands on cloud transformation projects. Examples include Marriott International, Shop Direct, US Army, Lufthansa, AIG, WhatsApp, Fitbit, Gamestop and Westpac and industry solutions such as Coca Cola, Halliburton, Kimberly Clark, Siemens, Ford, 1-800-Flowers or Lions Gate."
IBM Solidified Its Business Analytics Ecosystem,Sep.29.16,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) has launched a new Watson initiative, called ""Project DataWorks."" For growing revenues and profitability, modern businesses depend on extracting insights from data, which is an extremely complex job. Project DataWorks is a comprehensive solution aiming to eliminate the complexities.Project DataWorks is available on IBM's cloud platform Bluemix. I believe this new offering will help IBM significantly grow its business analytics revenue, which was $17.9 billion in 2015.Project DataWorks: Competitive Advantage Against MicrosoftProject DataWorks is actually a big data analytics platform which primarily consists of two most sought-after software suites of today, which are IBM Watson and Apache Spark. The platform offers several advantages to data-driven professionals, such as a collaborative working environment, sharing common datasets and models, and automation of data asset deployment using IBM Watson and Apache Spark. What made IBM create such a platform? Well, this is a two-part story.Project DataWorks is a self-service platform. Gartner has high expectations about the evolution of self-service platforms. It said:By 2018, most business users and analysts in organizations will have access to self-service tools to prepare data for analysis as part of the shift to deploying modern BI platforms.By 2018, most stand-alone self-service data preparation offerings will either have expanded into end-to-end analytical platforms or been integrated as features of existing analytics platforms.By 2018, smart, governed, Hadoop-based, search-based and visual-based data discovery will converge in a single form of next-generation data discovery that will include self-service data preparation and natural-language generation."
IBM Can Reemerge As A Corporate Computing Powerhouse,Nov. 3.16,"Let's face it. When you think about tech and computing powerhouses, the name IBM (NYSE:IBM) hasn't come to mind since the 1990s. In fact, aside from the generic ""consulting"" response, the average investor (or even general bloke, for that matter) has no idea what IBM even does and that's being reflected in the stock's price. Shares of IBM haven't done well for investors over the last few years. Revenues and earnings are consistently horrific (at least on the surface) and shares are trading significantly lower than they did in 2012, 2013, 2014 and most of 2015. The stock peaked at around $195 in 2013 and was in free fall until the beginning of 2016. They've since increased roughly 15.6%; However, your typical investor still doesn't know exactly what to make of IBM.You know IBM is in the cloud business. You know IBM is in the AI business. You know IBM is in the consulting business; But, what don't you know about IBM? Does IBM offer opportunities for future growth and, if so, in what segment? Let's take a look at some of the compelling reasons those who are long IBM haven't sold off their positions.IBM Got Famous by Building ComputersIn the 1990's, IBM was the leading manufacturer of PCs in the U.S.. IBM successfully predicted a decline in PC sales and sold off its personal computer business in 2004 to Lenovo. Of course, the move facilitated a huge decline in revenue at the time but that revenue was already beginning to offer such low margins that one could have argued the company was better off sticking the cash elsewhere. The company retained its 32-bit server architecture business for another decade again selling to Lenovo in 2014 which wasn't a surprise at the time given the fact that IBM wasn't producing any of the hardware itself. They were simply assembling servers and shipping them out. Again, another decrease in low margin revenue which likewise could have been seen as a necessary move. By then, 32-bit architecture wasn't going anywhere anyway."
How IBM Is Silently Becoming An Autonomous Vehicle Leader,Apr.21.17,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) declared its first quarter 2017 results few days ago, after which the company's shares witnessed unexpected sell-off. According to Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein, ""IBM's results were just not good."" IBM delivered over $18 billion in revenue and operating EPS of $2.38, which is up YoY. I don't believe the result is bad actually. Granted, YoY revenue declined for the 20th consecutive quarter, but long-term investors and the analyst community should remember that IBM's business model is futuristic. It is actually an artificial intelligence (AI) company.I strongly believe the sell-off is nothing more than a routine correction, which offers an excellent opportunity to buy the stock at a cheaper price. Post Watson, IBM's next growth driver will be its initiative in autonomous vehicles. Big Blue's approach for autonomous vehicles is very different and versatile compared to that of today's leaders in the industry, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Its recent announcement of winning an artificial intelligence patent for autonomous vehicles has huge potential to make it the leader in the industry. Despite that, investors and analysts don't consider IBM a significant player in the autonomous vehicles industry. In this article I will analyze how the patent could change the whole story of autonomous vehicles in IBM's favor.IBM: The Patent Is A Significant MilestoneWinning the patent is an encouraging development from investors' point of view since it can help IBM begin earning revenues sooner than earlier expected by industry observers. Fully autonomous vehicles won't arrive on the roads before a decade or so. However, semi-autonomous vehicles will be a reality within 2020."
IBM Continues To Melt Away,Apr.20.17,"Image creditIBM (NYSE:IBM) has struggled for years at this point to make itself relevant again. The once-mighty tech giant has become a dinosaur stuck in primordial ooze that cannot seem to get out of its own way. The playbook in the past was for extremely well paid executives to buy back loads of stock and hope for the best but that strategy proved - unsurprisingly - to be a loser. To its credit, IBM is trying these days with its strategic imperatives but as we saw yet again in Q1, it just isn't enough.IBM's problems start and end with revenue, which has now fallen Y/Y for 20 consecutive quarters. Just let that sink in - it has been five years since IBM posted a quarter where revenue actually moved above flat over the prior year. That's absolutely astounding and it is the principal reason why the shares are stuck where they are and indeed, why I've been so very bearish on IBM in the past.The problem also is not just that revenue in total is down, it is that IBM has no real hope of fixing it anytime soon. Its biggest segment - Technology Services and Cloud Platforms - was down 2.5% and Systems continues to be absolutely dreadful with another mid-teens decline. In fact, Cognitive Solutions was the only segment with a revenue gain and it was a token one at +2.1%. Given the segment's size, that is far too small for IBM to get close to flat revenue and the dubious streak continues."
"The IBM Story, In 5 Easy Charts",Apr.20.17,"On Tuesday, after the close, IBM (NYSE:IBM) posted its first-quarter results. They were... not great. Though per-share profits of $2.38 were better than the expected $2.35, revenue missed estimates and the company logged a stunning 20th straight quarter of sinking year-over-year sales.Clearly, the paradigm shift IBM is working on - the one that makes it more of a cloud player and less of a system-sales company - isn't getting enough traction. Unfortunately, that's nothing new for investors.Also not new for IBM shareholders was that the conference call dishes out so many microscopic details that it's impossible to assemble them into a meaningful bigger picture (Five different corporate segments, each with a ""strategic imperatives"" and ""cloud"" sub-segment? Really?).Then again, that varied segmentation underscores the scope of the shift Big Blue is cultivating. The new focal points look so different than the old focal points, it's pointless to lump them together as one.With that as the backdrop, and knowing that a picture really is worth a thousand words, here's a closer look at five charts that tell the IBM story in a way that no amount of words can. If you're looking to reboot your opinion-forming of International Business Machines and want to start at a baseline of zero, keep reading.Technology Services and Cloud is the Breadwinner... Sort OfLast year, IBM regrouped its business lines into Global Business Services, Cognitive Solutions, Technology Services and Cloud, and Systems. It also continues to operate its Global Financing arm as a separate division, though its contribution to the revenue mix is a minor one.The chart of each of these segments' revenue is telling, and not in a good way. One would hope for at least one crystal clear growth leader, even knowing some if not most of these lines would be losing ground. There's no key growth driver. Do note, however, that its Systems business - mostly its legacy systems hardware and operating systems - continues to deteriorate. The company's conference call slides accurately explained this is a reflection of a product cycle in decline."
IBM: One Question For Mr. Buffett,Apr.24.17,"Shareholder Meeting 2016Although I do not plan to attend our Berkshire (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) shareholder annual meeting this year, if I did and given the opportunity, I would ask Warren Buffett about IBM (NYSE:IBM), a company that has failed to live up to earnings and revenue commitments made to shareholders five years ago.Early 2012On January 1, 2012, IBM's Ginni Rometty was appointed President and CEO of IBM.Less than eight weeks later, Berkshire Hathaway released Warren Buffett's 2011 Letter to Shareholders. In the letter, he described in some detail what he hoped to see from IBM over the next five years.Put yourself in Rometty's shoes.Weeks into one of the biggest corporate jobs in the world you read Buffett's letter which lays out in remarkable detail his expectations for your company over the next five years.What do you do?Glance at it and then throw it away?Read it and tuck it away in a folder that you plan to open back up on December 31, 2016?Or do you circulate it to every member of your senior management team and ask the CFO to report back to you quarterly on IBM's progress against your biggest shareholder's expectations?Wild guess: Buffett's letter was not trashed.Buffett on IBM in 2011 LetterHere is what Buffett wrote in his 2011 Letter. Certain words and figures are in bold for emphasis.Today, IBM has 1.16 billion shares outstanding, of which we own about 63.9 million or 5.5%. Naturally, what happens to the company's earnings over the next five years is of enormous importance to us. Beyond that, the company will likely spend $50 billion or so in those years to repurchase shares. Our quiz for the day: What should a long-term shareholder, such as Berkshire, cheer for during that period?I won't keep you in suspense. We should wish for IBM's stock price to languish throughout the five years.Let's do the math. If IBM's stock price averages, say, $200 during the period, the company will acquire 250 million shares for its $50 billion. There would consequently be 910 million shares outstanding and we would own about 7% of the company. If the stock conversely sells for an average of $300 during the five-year period, IBM will acquire only 167 million shares. That would leave about 990 million shares outstanding after five years, of which we would own 6.5%.If IBM were to earn, say, $20 billion in the fifth year, our share of those earnings would be a full $100 million greater under the ""disappointing"" scenario of a lower stock price than they would have been at the higher price. At some later point our shares would be worth perhaps $1 1⁄2 billion more than if the ""high-price"" repurchase scenario had taken place."""
IBM: This Dog Of The Dow Is About To Return To Growth,Apr. 3.17,"Despite five consecutive years of declining sales, I recommend buying IBM (NYSE:IBM) based on its cheap valuation, their ability to increase what's already a lucrative dividend yield (3.22%), and a return to earnings growth. IBM's ""strategic imperatives"" involving analytics, cloud, mobile, social and security finally appear to be reaching a turning point. According to IBM's 2016 annual report:Our strategic imperatives have reached critical mass. At $33 billion, they now contribute 41 percent of IBM's revenue. With double-digit growth, we're on pace to achieve our goal of growing these businesses to $40 billion by 2018.""This is transforming IBM's business as they continue to move away from their legacy hardware, software and service businesses and is expected to allow them to return to annual EPS growth, which hasn't occurred since 2014.Past PerformanceAs evident in the table below, IBM has not exactly been firing on all cylinders the past couple of years. Revenue has declined 25% from all-time highs back in 2011, which has also put pressure on earnings."
Here's What To Learn From Warren Buffett's IBM 'Mistake',May.16.17,"Nobody is infallible. Not even Warren Buffett. He is an extraordinary investor who happily admits to making mistakes and predicts this to continue as long as he lives. This article is not about crucifying him (for something that might not be a mistake at all) but to draw valuable conclusions from his latest comments on Berkshire's IBM (NYSE:IBM) investment.Could be a mistakeIn 2016 Buffett said his IBM investment ""could be a mistake."" He has become much more articulate about his position lately:""I don't value IBM the same way that I did six years ago when I started buying, I've revalued it somewhat downward ... When it got above $180 we actually sold a reasonable amount of stock.""To understand what has changed we must have a quick look at how Buffett invests.It's all about those wide-moat companiesWarren Buffett is constantly looking for firms that have a competitive advantage, allowing them to earn a consistently high return on invested capital. This advantage (the moat around the castle) must be sustainable so as to prevent competitors from invading the company's market and pushing down profitability as a result.Investing the Warren Buffett way requires a tremendous amount of industry knowledge and expertise in business analysis. This cannot be achieved without total devotion to lifelong learning.""I read and read and read. I probably read five to six hours a day."" Warren BuffettHere's the problem (for most of us)Capitalism is all about reversion to the mean. If a company is earning extra-high returns on invested capital, others will be attracted to its field. As soon as the newcomers put some money to work in that lucrative-looking market they can spoil the party by creating an oversupply. (And many other ways.) As competition intensifies rates of return tend to sink."
IBM: A Turning Or Sinking Ship?,Mar.15.17,"Analyst opinions on what investors can expect from IBM (NYSE:IBM) in the near future range from surprisingly-bearish to fervently-bullish. Consider the following two analyst targets, as reported on Seeking Alpha:On March 7, 2017, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White raised his target on IBM from $186 to $215, citing IBM's new partnership with Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and their investments in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.On March 8, 2017, Jefferies analyst James Kisner reiterated an underperform rating on IBM, with a price target of $125, citing a lack of fundamentals despite investments in breakthrough areas including AI, blockchain, and quantum computing,With such a large range in targets, long investors in IBM may be left ""scratching their heads."" For these investors, does IBM still make sense as a core portfolio holding in 2017 and beyond?A Look At The DataWhile this analysis includes qualitative elements, I constructed a table of key financial data from IBM's annual reports for fiscal year (""FY"") 2007 through fiscal year 2016 to provide a quantitative component to the analysis as well.All table data in $millions except for Shares Outstanding, Stock Price per Common Share, and Employee Count. All reasonable attempts were made to record data accurately and correctly.The grey areas in the table represent fiscal years with Samuel Palmisano serving as CEO and the blue areas represent fiscal years with Virginia Rometty serving as CEO. All subsequent charts in this article reference data from this table."
Red Flags For IBM,May.22.17,"Shares of IBM (NYSE:IBM) may sound like a good value play. The company has a long track record of annual dividend increases. The dividend yield is high, the price to earnings is low, and the free cash flow per share is high. It may sound like it fits perfectly to the value investment strategy. No wonder Warren Buffett took a big bet on IBM in 2011. It was the perfect case according to his value investment style. However, the business has deteriorated sharply since his investment decision. There are many red flags that stand out. Particularly, my concerns point to following issues:Decline in revenue over multiple quartersRevenue growth driven by acquisitionsDecline in the sustainable cash flowTax management to manage the bottom lineDecrease in dividend payment abilityLevered balance sheetPerhaps that was the reason why Warren Buffett reduced his stake and why Moody's downgraded the stock by one notch. All of these make the long investment argument for IBM much weaker than it was in 2011. Let me please back-up the red flags with supporting evidence.Revenue DeclineIBM's revenue has been declining for the 20th consecutive quarter in a row. Moreover, the company recorded revenue of $91bn in the year 2006, and 10 years later, the revenue is $79.9bn. This is a decline of $11bn. Perhaps that was deliberate. The company announced a shift in the strategy towards higher-value segment years ago. And while it is short of $11bn, the profitability is only $1bn lower as measured by EBIT. One billion may look not that dramatic as a standalone number, but it will make more sense when I touch the ability to pay dividends later."
"IBM Raises Dividend, Warren Buffett Celebrates",Apr.25.17,"Last week, shares of IBM (NYSE:IBM) tumbled after the company announced its first quarter earnings, highlighted by a sizable revenue miss. With shares pulling back, the annual dividend rose nicely, and on Tuesday, the company announced its 22nd consecutive annual dividend increase. IBM continues to be an income investor's dream, and the Oracle of Omaha is definitely smiling this morning.The company's board announced a 10 cent per share increase to $1.50 per quarter, or $6.00 a year. This dime per share raise equals last year's increase, although the percentage increase is obviously lower since you are working off a higher base amount. As you can see in the chart below, IBM's dividend has now doubled since 2011. Figures in the chart below represent the amount the dividend was raised to that year, so $1.50 for this year as an example.(Source: IBM financial information page)The company's large share repurchase plan has a lot to do with these dividend increases, as IBM has reduced its share count nicely in recent years. However, the company has also increased its total dividend payouts rather comfortably, topping $5 billion in 2016 as seen on its cash flow statement (page 87).Later this year, I would expect an update from the company on that buyback plan. The company had about $3.8 billion remaining on the current plan according to information detailed in the latest earnings release, and IBM has averaged about $4 billion in share repurchases the last two years. While I don't know if the current plan will be completely finished this year, many companies like to announce buyback raises a quarter or two before they've completed their current authorization amounts."
IBM: How Smart Is Watson?,Feb.10.17,"The Future of IBMIn 2011, IBM Watson debuted on the TV show Jeopardy and impressed millions in a spectacle where the artificial intelligence defeated 2 of jeopardy's all time great champions. While Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft have been developing their AI to handle daily tasks such as shopping, calling an Uber, or playing music, IBM (NYSE: IBM) has been pushing Watson into tackling real world problems such as cancer diagnosis/treatment, traffic accident prevention, and tax reporting.IBM Watson, like the rest of its AI colleagues, is a product of machine learning, natural language processing, and statistical analysis. The difference lies in the types of data IBM is feeding Watson. Watson is being taught intellectual knowledge in the form of research papers, large industrial data reports, and other scholarly publishings. In 2015, CEO Virginia Rometty informed investors that IBM expects Watson to generate approximately $10 billion in revenue by 2024. Currently, Watson's platform extends to the fields of commerce, education, financial services, health, internet of things, marketing, supply chain management, and more.Source: Watson2016Watson in Recent ActionIn December 2016, automaker BMW (ETR:BMW) announced that they would use the Watson AI technology to create ""intelligent assistant functions"" for the company's i8 hybrid sports cars. These functions refer to conversing with the automobile's AI to get news on efficient routing, traffic, and weather. More importantly, these AI-powered automobiles will communicate with each other through radio transmission to cut down on accidents. The U.S. transportation department has voiced their proposal to implement vehicle to vehicle communication that can save countless lives. With US traffic fatalities rising 8% y/y in the first nine months of 2016, this proposal will certainly garner more attention."
IBM Q1 2017: An Interesting Note,Apr.26.17,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) took a big hit after the announcement of 2017 Q1 earnings. The heavy news was that it now has completed a full five years of continued year-over-year revenue declines. Many investors have had enough, and IBM's price dropped $9 the day after the announcement.The good news was that EPS was up at $2.38, beating both last year's figure and analysts' estimate by three cents.But the bad news prevailed. Investors were unhappy with the top line as revenue continued to drop in same quarter comparisons. At $18.16 billion, it fell 2.8%. Even worse, many analysts were more worried about a tumble in gross margins that fell to 42.8% from year ago at 46.5%.According to a Barron's article, David Grossman of Stifel Nicolaus wrote:While the y/y gross margin compares have been negative, the trend worsened, which was perhaps the most significant negative in the quarter.An overlooked strategic pointThere are a lot of details in the financial report to be noted and their respective import debated, but I have found one interesting set of data regarding the Strategic Imperatives program. This is precisely where IBM is setting its sights for the future.IBM's ""Strategic Imperatives"" are newer technologies in which the company is investing heavily. In fact, CEO Ginni Rometty's whole plan is to reinvent the 100-year-old company into a new company with these initiatives. Unfortunately, for the investor, they do not coincide precisely with the existing business segments. Rather, they overlap them. So, specific data does not appear in the filings' data sets, only in the comments there, and in other statements by officers, as in the earnings call.The initiative comprises:Cloud offerings,Watson and analytics,Security,Social, andMobile TechnologiesIBM is trying to ramp these up as its more traditional services have become outmoded. The question is, how quickly will the ramp-up replace the customer led ramp-down of the traditional offerings?"
IBM: Dividend Growth Set To Slow,Apr. 9.17,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) has increased its dividend annually since 1996. Since 2004, during the Sam Palmisano tenure through today with Ginni Rometty, investors in IBM have enjoyed not only consistent annual dividend increases, but also a significant increase each year.As the paragraphs below will show, IBM's rate of dividend increases may have to slow down in the future. Investors long IBM may need to reconsider their position if IBM begins to slow its rate of dividend increases.IBM's Dividend HistoryFollowing a few years of stagnant and reduced dividends, IBM has consistently increased its annual distribution since 1996. The table below shows annual dividends paid for each year adjusted for stock splits as well as the percentage increase versus prior year.IBM Dividend HistoryYear Amount Paid % Increase Year Amount Paid % Increase2016 $5.50 10.00% 2005 $0.78 11.43%2015 $5.00 17.65% 2004 $0.70 11.11%2014 $4.25 14.86% 2003 $0.63 6.78%2013 $3.70 12.12% 2002 $0.59 7.27%2012 $3.30 13.79% 2001 $0.55 7.84%2011 $2.90 16.00% 2000 $0.51 8.51%2010 $2.50 16.28% 1999 $0.47 9.30%2009 $2.15 13.16% 1998 $0.43 10.97%2008 $1.90 26.67% 1997 $0.3875 19.23%2007 $1.50 36.36% 1996 $0.32530.00%2006 $1.10 41.03%(source)As shown above, IBM has proven itself to be a consistent dividend payer, and its annual increases have not been stingy.

IBM: Becoming Tempting With Progress Being Made And Cash Flow Still Being Produced,Mar.28.17,"International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has interested me for some time. Nonetheless, this has never led to me actually make a move and buy into the company. Many others seem to have done a similar thing. Honestly, I think many rarely got far beyond their obvious top and bottom line figures which have seen a clear trend over the last half-decade: down. Indeed, both operating income and revenue were over 15% lower than that seen by the company a decade ago:Nor are analysts particularly expecting this to change any time in the immediate future even if stabilization is likely.Throw in a very noticeable rise in its debt levels leading to a hefty debt-to-equity ratio rise and there are, perhaps, plenty of reasons why investors may feel right in reacting a little coolly to IBM's shares in recent years:"
A Look Back At Warren Buffett's 5-Year IBM Prediction,Mar.24.17,"In Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) 2011 annual shareholder letter, Warren Buffet put out some thoughts on share repurchases. The first portion related to Berkshire's own share repurchase policy, with a specific emphasis on when this sort of activity may or may not make sense. The second portion laid out a hypothetical five-year illustration using Berkshire's then newly acquired partial stake in IBM (NYSE:IBM) as an example.Although it should be underscored that this was merely a theoretical exercise, it can still be useful to see what's happened in the last five years. I'll start from the beginning of the illustration and work through the demonstration as we go. Buffett begins:This discussion of repurchases offers me the chance to address the irrational reaction of many investors to changes in stock prices. When Berkshire buys stock in a company that is repurchasing shares, we hope for two events: First, we have the normal hope that earnings of the business will increase at a good clip for a long time to come; and second, we also hope that the stock underperforms in the market for a long time as well. A corollary to this second point: ""Talking our book"" about a stock we own -- were that to be effective -- would actually be harmful to Berkshire, not helpful as commentators customarily assume.This strikes true to the long-term investor mindset. If you're a trader looking for a quick buck, the last thing that you'd hope for is a declining, stagnant or even market trailing stock price. On the other hand, as we're about to see, this is the exact thing that the long-term owner ought to be rooting for. There's an immediate disconnect between trader and investor when you're talking about what's most beneficial on the share repurchase front."
IBM: Warren Buffett Is Holding On Despite The 5% Decline (And You Should Too),Apr.23.17,"Written by Bob Ciura for Sure Dividend on April 22nd, 2017.Shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) fell 5% on Wednesday, April 19, after the company posted a disappointing first-quarter earnings report. Legendary investor Warren Buffett took a big hit from IBM’s decline. His investment conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) is IBM’s largest shareholder. At the end of 2016, Berkshire held 81.2 million shares of IBM, good for 8.5% of the company’s share count. Berkshire’s investment is worth approximately $13 billion. IBM is one of Buffett’s highest yielding holdings. After the 5% decline, Berkshire’s investment in IBM lost roughly $800 million in value.IBM is a high-quality dividend stock. It is a Dividend Achiever, a group of 265 stocks with 10+ years of consecutive dividend increases. With four more years of dividend increases, IBM will join the ranks of the Dividend Aristocrats, a group of companies in the S&P 500 that have raised dividends for 25+ years.Despite the one-day drubbing, Buffett likely has no intention to sell IBM—and neither should you.Business OverviewIBM’s recent stock price decline stems from its first-quarter report. IBM reported adjusted earnings-per-share of $2.38, on $18.16 billion of revenue. Adjusted earnings-per-share beat expectations of $2.35, but revenue fell short by about $230 million.On a year-over-year basis, first quarter revenue declined 3%, while adjusted earnings-per-share increased 1%. Cost discipline helped the company exceed earnings-per-share estimates. But investors seem to be focused on IBM’s revenue. Not only did it miss estimates, this past quarter represented the 20th in a row of declining revenue for the company.IBM’s turnaround is fueled by growth in what the company calls its “strategic imperatives.” These include big data, security, mobile, analytics, and the cloud.IBM believes there is a huge market opportunity across these areas."
IBM Continues Its Downward Growth Trajectory As Warren Buffett Trims His Position,May. 7.17,"PurposeIn a 2014 article, I cautioned investors that despite a big selloff in International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) shares and a cheap valuation, its new strategic growth direction faced stiff competition, and that it would take time to see if the initiative could turn the behemoth of a ship towards smoother waters. On Thursday, Warren Buffett announced he had cut his stake in IBM by a third, citing stiff competition as a major reason. In this article, I will take a fresh look at IBM to see how it has performed since 2014 and offer new guidance for investors.BackgroundIn my October 28, 2014, article on SA, I questioned whether IBM was a value stock or was simply dead money. At that time, IBM had just released some very disappointing Q3 results and announced a fresh round of layoffs. However, CEO Ginni Rometty was quite optimistic about IBM's future, as the company was said to be modernizing its services offerings to be areas of strategic growth, with cloud services, analytics, mobile, and security revenues showing strong double-digit growth. Although the new directions for IBM appeared promising at the time, I questioned whether the company was up to turning the ship strategically in this new direction, stating that:"
The Lessons From Buffett's Investment In IBM,May.15.17,"Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) recently disclosed that it sold about 1/3 of its stake in International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). In addition, Buffett admitted that he was wrong in his thesis for the stock. And while the Oracle of Omaha always learns his lessons from his investing experiences, investors should make sure that they too learn some key points from this case. In this article, I will analyze what lessons investors should learn from this case in order to avoid similar mistakes.First of all, it is important to understand the magnitude of the error of Buffett and the reason for his poor investment decision. Buffett initiated a stake in IBM in Q3-2011 at an average entry point around $170. IBM has lost 12% since then while S&P (NYSEARCA:SPY) has essentially doubled, the stock has dramatically underperformed the market since Buffett purchased it. This is impressive, particularly given the exceptional record the company had exhibited before Buffett purchased its shares.Buffett had always abstained from tech stocks because he did not understand them well and because competition was always fierce in that sector, as the most brilliant minds of this world competed with each other to deliver the next big thing. Therefore, it was surprising that Buffett bought a large stake in IBM. However, he broke his rules thanks to the exceptionally consistent growth of the company and its seemingly cheap valuation. To be sure, when Buffett bought IBM, the stock was trading at a markedly low P/E ratio, around 10. Even better, the company was executing aggressive share repurchases, which seemed to be very efficient thanks to the cheap valuation of the stock. To make a long story short, the excellent record of IBM, its remarkably low P/E ratio and its aggressive share buybacks, all of which were constituents for investing success according to the experience of Buffett, led him purchase the stock even though he did not understand its business very well."
Look Who Is Selling IBM Shares Now!,May.15.17,"The company has completely reinvented itself more than once over its stories history and is in the middle of its latest attempt to transform from a moth to a beautiful butterfly. So far investors have continued to retain the belief that the company can pull it off again. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been losing revenue year after year for some time now. Management has been repositioning the company to develop its businesses with greater growth potential. So far the verdict is still out on how the latest remaking of IBM will turn out.Insiders sellingOver the last twelve months insiders have been net sellers of IBM shares. Over that time there have been 11 insider buys and 43 sales of company stock. The net number of shares sold was only 67,219 shares (127,496 less 60,277). Over the past three months there has been only one transaction reported by an insider, an executive sold about half of his options recently exercised (2,866 shares), probably to pay for the remaining shares from the options execution. This means that his net position in shares will have increased.Looking at the rest of the numbers it would be reasonable to suspect that this is the likely reality of most of the insider trades. But the lack of additional purchases does seem to cause us concern that the commitment of management and the board is not overwhelmingly positive at this point.Verdict: inconclusive.Warren BuffettBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) has long been the largest single IBM shareholder and Mr. Buffett has long touted his praise for IBM. Over the first two quarters of 2017 Berkshire has sold 31 million of its original 81 million share position in IBM. When asked why the company had sold more than a third of its shares a spokesperson answered:"
GE: Another IBM,Apr.21.17,"GE as another IBMSometimes things come around with just the name changing.For example, here is the lead company-specific article on Yahoo! Finance (YHOO) Friday afternoon:General Electric shares fall 1% after earnings beat Street's expectationsAs if those earnings were not the fake non-GAAP numbers, and as if anyone should care whether by late April, the Street had finally figured out how to make sure its consensus estimate was beatable.But that's the level of thinking we get today from the financial media, lapdogs if ever there was such a thing.(This is a CNBC article and video, but the video link on CNBC.com had problems, so I had to link to Yahoo! Finance).The interviewee began the video saying something like, ""poor Jeff Immelt, this is a transition he's been working his whole career.""Sorry to argue with that gentleman, but look what Steve Jobs did with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 2.0 in just a few years after returning in the late '90s. Look at the nice turnaround in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) - still maybe an overvalued stock but clearly operating better these days - when Steve Ballmer was finally shown the door. Look at the turnaround at Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) when Mr. Schultz had to return as CEO. And so on. How many years has it taken Jeff Immelt to take GE (NYSE:GE)... where?Why this is reminiscent of IBM (NYSE:IBM) was summed up in the title of my first IBM article for Seeking Alpha in July 2013 after its Q2 earnings report, followed by my concluding two sentences:IBM And The Media Attempt To Obscure Its Declining Business Results...It now is a troubled company that feels forced to resort to obfuscating its results rather than presenting them clearly.It is unclear that with these difficulties, IBM will do any better for investors than a Treasury security. It would appear that better and less-complicated risk-reward opportunities can be found elsewhere in the investment universe."

IBM Is Still A Great Long-Term Buy,Mar.16.17,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) has seen its revenues come down considerably over the past few years. This dragged net income down with it. Investors saw this as a warning sign, resulting in a disappointing share price performance for IBM's stock between 2012 and 2016. Despite a good appreciation of IBM's shares in the most recent year, there are still a lot of investors that are pessimistic about IBM's future. For the most part this is due to management's inability to return to revenue growth. I believe however that IBM is still a great value stock which long term investors can get excited about, as it has been for years.Worrying trendThe most discussed trend that worries investors is the company's revenue trend. Revenue reached $106.92 bln in 2012 after which IBM has seen nothing but revenue declines yoy, causing pressure on net income. In total revenue has declined by a quarter between 2012 and the most recent fiscal year.When you look at just the chart there is no sign of any sort of progress in the company's performance. Therefore it is understandable that the number of pessimists is so large. Management has to do something to spur growth in both its top and bottom line. And although if at first glance it might not look like management is succeeding, progress is being made by its strategic imperatives.Strategic ImperativesOne of IBM's promising segments is that of the cloud, which is part of its strategic imperatives. Over the most recent fiscal quarter, IBM saw cloud revenue grow by 33% yoy to $4.2 bln. For the full fiscal year IBM managed to generate cloud revenue worth $13.7 bln. In total strategic imperatives were good for $33 bln worth of revenue over the fiscal year, a 14% yoy growth. One concern investors have with the focus on the strategic imperatives is that the growth is slowing down. But this is only percentage wise. For the past two years revenue has grown by $4 bln, which actually means growth is consistent. Management had stated previously that their goal is to grow their strategic imperatives to $40 bln by 2018 and still believes that they will be able to achieve this."
IBM: The Bar Is Set Too Low,Apr. 6.17,"As I started preparing for IBM's (NYSE:IBM) 1Q17 earnings report, expected to come out April 18th, I came to an interesting realization. It seems to me like the Street is pricing the stock too conservatively, given what I believe the company is able to produce, particularly in the longer term.Credit: Tu Windows MundoThis is not to say that IBM is likely to soon drive aggressive top-line growth or to drastically improve bottom-line results. I believe, however, that the bar is set too low for the tech blue chip, and that the stock is priced for unimpressive performance at best.Last quarter, the company conservatively introduced FY17 guidance of at least $13.80 in non-GAAP EPS, which would represent a modest 1.5% YOY earnings improvement at the minimum expected level. The Street, curiously, increased its own estimate but only slightly, to $13.79 for FY17, below management's low end of the guidance.More telling, however, is the Street's five-year EPS growth forecast of only 4.3%. I find this estimate very conservative, as IBM (1) continues to increase its revenue mix shift toward faster-growth strategic initiatives and (2) should see margins stabilize, following a period of heavier investments in the build up of the ""as-a-Service"" platform, plus cognitive and cloud in 2015 and 2016.Looking farther into the futureEarlier in March, IBM's management delivered its investor briefing and shared its expectations for the long term. The chart below summarizes the key message regarding revenue and pretax income growth by segment."
IBM: Still A Buy?,Jan.13.17,"We have been shareholders of IBM (NYSE:IBM) since February 2016 and were lucky enough to start our position at $122 per share. Then, in July 2016, we wrote a bullish article on IBM and increased our position. Back in July we wrote:IBM has fallen from a peak of $215 in 2013 to its current level of $152. I believe the negative sentiment is shifting, and that, at current prices, this stock is an interesting investment"".After that article, we had the opportunity to conduct interviews with IBM executives. In the first part of our interview, we tried to understand the long-term vision of the firm. We then elaborated on Watson, IBM's cognitive system (you can find our discussion here). We then had the chance to dig deeper and have a conversation with Rob High, IBM Watson's CTO, and tried to shed some light on Watson's business model. In our last articles, we interviewed Don Boulia VP of IBM's Cloud and explored IBM blockchain initiatives. After all this research, we remain positive that IBM is a good investment. We are still shareholders, and we are considering increasing our position, especially if the stock experiences some weakness during the earnings' season.Since 2013, IBM's share price has been hammered by negative sentiment. It has fallen as low as $120, though today, it's at $168. We believe, however, that the negative sentiment is diminishing and that, at current prices, this stock is a good investment. Although the core business of IBM isn't doing so well, its new ""strategic imperatives"" are rapidly growing and will soon represent the majority of the company's sales."
The $340 Million Question IBM Needs To Answer On Its Fourth Quarter Earnings Call,Jan.11.17,"In previous columns, I've stated repeatedly that I believe there are serious accounting red flags at IBM (NYSE:IBM).To catch you up briefly, I've detailed how, in my view, IBM has overspent on acquisitions, repeatedly found itself entangled in bribery and accounting scandals both domestically and overseas, and rewarded its executives for subpar performance. (Executives who, I believe, also are overstating the prowess of their cloud business.)Now, before I became an investor and the founder of Worm Capital, I was - and still am - a forensic accountant. And if I were auditing IBM's books today, it's my belief that there's something very fishy going on. Specifically, it has to do with a claim in IBM's Q3 2016 financials that the company suddenly struck a deal to bring in $340 million - quarterly - by licensing their software IP to three unnamed entities.That's a $1.4 billion annual run rate.Now, if I told you someone bought a house for $100,000, that wouldn't be too surprising, right?But if I told you someone was going to rent a house for $100,000 for 90 days - that would raise some eyebrows. You'd probably be curious about who could afford such rent, and what kind of house would be worth renting (not owning!) for $100,000 per quarter.And yet, none of that has happened with this absolutely massive deal at IBM. The company has not named the three entities that are supposedly renting their software for this enormous sum, nor they have they disclosed the actual technology being licensed. This is a big deal, and it raises a number of very specific (and potentially uncomfortable) accounting questions for an auditor, which I will outline below."
IBM: Nearing Dividend Aristocrat Status,Apr.13.17,"Using dividend and value investing guidelines as a filter, I have found International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) to be a slightly overvalued stock that has strong appeal to income investors.IBM's profitability metrics are strong with consistently stellar ROE and ROIC - ranging 69-100% and 21-32.5%, respectively - over the past six years with strong numbers spanning the decades before that. While revenue and earnings have been declining due to the company's strategic shift, there is a good reason to believe that the business will begin to enjoy growth in the near future as the company has been delivering on its key objectives. This sentiment was echoed by CEO Virginia Rometty in the company's most recent annual report:""Understanding IBM at the start of 2017 requires a longer view … We got out of commoditizing businesses-trimming $8 billion from our top line … We redoubled our efforts to reinvent our core hardware, software and services franchises, while investing to create new ones-in cloud, data, cognitive, security and the other businesses that comprise our strategic imperatives … While our transformation continues, a strong foundation is now in place. Our strategic imperatives have reached critical mass. At $33 billion, they now contribute 41 percent of IBM's revenue. With double-digit growth, we're on pace to achieve our goal of growing these businesses to $40 billion by 2018. Most importantly, within these businesses, we have built unique and powerful platforms with Watson and the IBM Cloud.""The company is reasonably financed with a current ratio of 1.21 and has drastically reduced the share count from 1.457 million to 959 million over the past decade, helping to support its rising dividend payout and soften the blow from declining earnings."
Stock Exchange: Time To Buy The Dip In IBM?,May.19.17,"Each week we highlight the results from different technical trading methods. We also provide contrast from a fundamental analyst. It is always interesting when we find a pick where multiple methods agree. This week, two different approaches choose IBM.ReviewOur last Stock Exchange featured multiple stock ideas from our group. That is normal with widely varying methods. The group consensus on NVDA two weeks ago was a rare situation.The lack of consensus is not a negative market sign; it is business as usual. Attractive trades normally vary according to your approach.Let’s turn to this week’s ideas.This Week— Time to Buy the Dip in IBM?International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) has attracted a lot of recent interest. The recent earnings report was a “beat” but a miss on revenue. Analyst downgrades followed. A couple of weeks later, there was news that Warren Buffett, a major stockholder, had sold about 20% of his position. This took the stock down further. Many complain that the company earnings do not come from organic growth, but result only from “financial engineering.” Others question the business model.This provides an interesting backdrop for Holmes, who is buying the dip.Holmes: IBM’s two-and-a-half-month slide has brought it down to a very attractive price. We’re currently trading around pre-November levels, a remarkable bargain. Let’s check the chart:Jeff: In today’s introduction I explained the background of the recent losses. Revenue. Financial engineering. Mr. Buffett sold 20% of his stake."
How And Why IBM Can Challenge Microsoft Office And Adobe Creative Cloud,May.26.17,"The full potential of International Business Machines (IBM) in the $148 billion cloud computing market can be achieved if it targets Microsoft’s (MSFT) leadership in Enterprise SaaS (Software-as-a-Service). The Enterprise Collaboration market is predicted to grow from $26 billion last year to $49 billion by 2021.Productivity and collaboration apps like Microsoft Office 365 and Google’s (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) G Suite dominated last year’s list of most used cloud apps and SaaS offerings. IBM’s tepid collaboration effort is still limited to providing “social networks.” The IBM Verse email client is not going to help IBM become relevant in enterprise collaboration anytime soon. Corporate employees need groupware productivity programs that will let them create documents, not just exchange email messages.In the enterprise SaaS industry, IBM only leads in the System Infrastructure niche. On the other hand, the more diversified portfolio (Skype, Dynamics, and Office 365) of Microsoft made it a leader in CRM, Collaboration, and Other Enterprise Applications."
How Secure Is IBM?,Oct.27.17,"IntroductionAccording to Statista, the enterprise security market is going to reach $71B by 2020, almost double the levels achieved in 2015.(Source: Statista; Revenue from the enterprise security market worldwide from 2013 to 2020, in $B)Therefore, this space can offer interesting growth opportunities. Earlier this month we wrote about Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO), arguing that its move into the security market should be met with some caution. We then wrote about Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT), a provider of cybersecurity solutions for enterprises, service providers, and government organizations worldwide.Today we focus on IBM (NYSE:IBM) security. This section has been prepared with the assistance of our contacts within the company.Market PotentialIn our Cisco article, we noted that much of the potential for growth in this segment comes from a global uptick in awareness of the importance of cybersecurity. As our personal and financial data continues its relentless march online, many firms have been publicly found out for a want of protection over these key assets.(Source: Network World)Cisco itself released an annual cybersecurity report this year, which noted that 29% of organisations that faced an online security breach lost revenue, with 38% of those losses accounting for more than 20% of those companies' revenue. A quarter of businesses facing breaches cited lost business opportunities, with 42% of them losing more than 20%. Aside from the obvious detrimental effects on operational and finance systems, brand reputation and customer retention can take a lengthy period to recover. Businesses are becoming more aware of this risk every day."
IBM: Selling Impetus For Warren Buffett,Oct.22.17,"Buffett Is Not A Buy-and-Hold Forever InvestorContrary to popular belief, Warren Buffett is not a buy-and-hold-forever investor. Perhaps the most ardent subscriber of the “never-sell” investing strategy or policy is that of our very own community participant Buyandhold 2012. He is an advocate of buying stocks judiciously and then forgetting about selling them thereafter. He has reiterated this point almost ad infinitum in the comments section (take a look here and there) of numerous articles in Seeking Alpha, particularly those related to blue-chip stocks like Unilever (UL)(UN) and McDonald's (MCD).On the other hand, investing legend Warren Buffett has made it clear that Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A)(BRK.B) never committed to not sell any of its tradable holdings. Note that he made a distinction between listed securities and those the company controlled entirely. In his latest shareholder letter, he stated (emphasis mine):Sometimes the comments of shareholders or media imply that we will own certain stocks “forever.” It is true that we own some stocks that I have no intention of selling for as far as the eye can see (and we’re talking 20/20 vision). But we have made no commitment that Berkshire will hold any of its marketable securities forever.Confusion about this point may have resulted from a too-casual reading of Economic Principle 11 on pages 110 - 111, which has been included in our annual reports since 1983. That principle covers controlled businesses, not marketable securities. This year I’ve added a final sentence to #11 to ensure that our owners understand that we regard any marketable security as available for sale, however unlikely such a sale now seems."
Uncertain Future For IBM If It Does Not Solve A Critical Issue,Oct.24.17,"IBM (IBM) has struggled for quite a few years with a dangerous downturn in revenue associated with a decline in earnings. In my opinion, the company will have to do much more to overcome the market demands. It must become a company with sustained growth - even somehow reduced to no more than 2% or 3% - allowing investors and shareholders to see added value and a real potential from a long-term perspective.We are aware of the problems the company faces and the strong need for the ongoing turnaround to be successful. After 22 quarters of continued revenue decline, the Q3 report came with an almost symbolic decrease of 0.4%. For a company of this size, the effort was necessarily formidable and I believe there are reasons for a cautious optimism. In fact, the new strategy of the company seems to indicate that the return of sales growth may be near.In spite of the problems, for shareholders there has always been a strong appeal: its dividend yield around 3.5%, which is remarkably high for an IT company. The dividend has been proudly paid systematically since 1913, and even with annual increases in the last two decades. In fundamental terms the decline in the number of shares outstanding has been pleasing to shareholders as a way to raise EPS. We may even say that this is done too insistently because in this way its free cash flow is largely spent on dividends and buying back shares. Few funds remain for real expenditures on endogenous development and timely and essential acquisitions of companies.In Q3 2017, IBM's strategic imperatives (cloud, analytics, security and mobile technologies) represented 45% of IBM revenue reaching $8.8B, and showing 10% growth year-over-year. Its traditional IT business reached $10.4B of revenue, a decrease of 9% over the same quarter of the previous year. It important to say that strategic imperatives are growing steadily but at a growth rate of no more than 10% in the last 12 months."
IBM Finally Has A Tailwind,Aug.29.17,"Photo creditIt is no secret that over the past few years, I’ve been pretty bearish on IBM (IBM). The company’s complete lack of strategy to deal with its legacy business has been a huge turn off and while it does have its strategic initiatives to drive some growth, the legacy business remains unequivocally terrible. However, the weakness in the US dollar (UUP) has given IBM a mighty fine tailwind it sorely needs and below, I’ll quantify what that means for the stock.We’ll begin with a look at the dollar as represented by the widely traded ETP. This is a weekly look at the dollar for the past two years and as you can see, the action in 2017 has been very one-sided and favors multinationals like IBM in a big way.The dollar has fallen just about in a straight line in 2017 with UUP coming from almost $27 as the year turned over to under $24 now, a huge move for the dollar in that period of time. As the dollar has weakened it has helped to reverse some damage done to multinationals like IBM that get a significant portion of their revenue from outside the US. And given the price action I see here, it looks like the dollar wants to go lower. The momentum indicators are very weak and while we may get an oversold bounce – maybe – the trend looks terrible for longs and there is support at current levels that needs to hold. If it doesn’t, look out below."
IBM: Blockchain Play?,Oct.17.17,"Warren Buffett sold about a third of his Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) stake in IBM (IBM) earlier this year. The stock is down 4% in the last three months as it continues to work on a transition toward higher margin software-focused businesses - such as cloud computing.The plan is to get aggressive and unload the low-margin hardware business, which it started doing in 2014. However, even with this, margins have been shrinking at IBM. But it has been investing in research and development since then, and its showing some signs of bearing fruit, with a market lead position in cloud and blockchain technology.The cloud remains the center of the software pivot, but the blockchain is the new high growth story. The think tank that led the personal PC revolution in the 80s, embraced the internet early in the 90s, and transitioned from the old PC architecture to the cloud in the early 2000s is reinventing computing again. IBM is emerging as the leader in the biggest technology development in enterprise computing since the internet, the blockchain. Companies expect the transparent and tamper-proof digital ledger to impact costs, security and risks by as much as 70-90%, reports IBM.Investing in the Future of Enterprise ComputingThese accomplishments highlight IBM's proven ability to maintain a sustainable competitive advantage. Reinventing industries, though, has taken IBM on a few earnings rollercoasters. Beyond earnings, economic value added (EVA) has sometimes been a more accurate gauge of how IBM's underlying business is performing."
IBM - Laying The Groundwork For Blockchain Domination,Nov.28.17,"There are a handful of technology companies that we will one day be able to look back on that changed the world. IBM (NYSE:IBM) is certainly one of those companies.While they have struggled for growth through 2017, Big Blue is preparing to ride the wave of blockchain through 2018. IBM is a leader in AI, processors, and deep learning and I believe the company is planning to an industry leader in blockchain. Leveraging public ledgers, cloud servers, and their ability to scale, IBM is positioned to grow along with the blockchain market. Let's look into how IBM is taking the helm in blockchain.IBM Proposal To Use Blockchain To Manage Supply Chain in British ColombiaNot something I'd ever expect to be reading and writing about but as times change, Big Blue is here leading the pack through innovation. As many may know, Canada is in the process of legalizing marijuana which should be completed in July of 2018. Ottawa is planning to leave regulation and sale of medical marijuana in the hands of the Canadian provinces. British Columbia asked for insight on the marijuana market which IBM was quick to offer a regulatory filing suggesting the use of blockchain for the legal marijuana market. In the filing, IBM said,IBM suggests Blockchain is an ideal mechanism in which BC can transparently capture the history of cannabis through the entire supply chain, ultimately ensuring consumer safety while exerting regulatory control – from seed to sale.Blockchain was traditionally built as a public shared transaction ledger to keep track of payments within the network. IBM is hard at work repurposing this into something that can be used to facilitate business in BC while leveraging IBM technology. Since blockchain ledgers are updated in real time, a new level of transparency and control could be brought to the hands of regulators. Some key benefits being:"
"IBM: Never Mind The Cloud, Here Is What Should Excite Investors",Sep.24.17,"When I last covered International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), I made the argument that while the company is inherently riskier than competitors such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM could have significantly more upside as a result of growth in its cloud business, along with an attractive valuation.In price terms, IBM stock has continued its decline since my last article:In hindsight, my forecasts that IBM would grow simply by virtue of growth in its cloud business, along with an attractive valuation, may have been erroneous. The cloud has become a highly competitive space in the technology space, and as it becomes increasingly commoditised, margins are likely to shrink over time. Therefore, growth in IBM’s cloud business alone will not necessarily be sufficient to propel the company’s growth long term.Blockchain As A Game ChangerHowever, there is one potential key differentiator which could see a turning point for IBM: blockchain.The company is currently recognised as the leader in this technology, with 40% of tech executives citing IBM as the top dog in this field, compared to half that number citing Microsoft as such.Blockchain works by means of allowing a decentralised network which allows the information on the blockchain to be shared and continually reconciled.Blockchain specialist William Mougayar uses a Google Docs analogy to explain the benefits of blockchain:“The traditional way of sharing documents with collaboration is to send a Microsoft Word document to another recipient, and ask them to make revisions to it. The problem with that scenario is that you need to wait until receiving a return copy before you can see or make other changes because you are locked out of editing it until the other person is done with it. With Google Docs (or Google Sheets), both parties have access to the same document at the same time, and the single version of that document is always visible to both of them. It is like a shared ledger, but it is a shared document. The distributed part comes into play when sharing involves a number of people.”"
Why Does Anyone Own IBM?,Jul.19.17,"Photo creditIBM (IBM) has been a perpetual disappointment for years at this point. The company’s strategic initiatives have worked but the legacy company continues to be such an enormous anchor that it is difficult to tell just when – or if – the initiatives will actually produce meaningful growth for the entire company. I have remained bearish on IBM for a long time and another rubbish earnings report has done nothing but strengthen my resolve on the bearish side.Before we get to the actual report, this chart has once again turned very ugly for the bulls. We saw a protracted rally that began last October and ended rather abruptly in late February but in that time, IBM went from $143 to $181. In addition, that was enough to turn the 200DMA sharply upward as well as produce strong readings on the momentum indicators. But that all unraveled pretty quickly and a huge gap down in April is going to be very difficult for IBM to fill and until it does, the stock will have a hard time sustaining any sort of meaningful rally.And with the stock down three percent as I write this, it looks like we’re going to have a test of the May low just below $150 and if that breaks, things could get very ugly for longs. We’re not there yet and we’d need a few days to confirm the break but it certainly looks like a distinct possibility at this point. Couple that with a now-flat 200DMA, a negatively-sloped 50DMA and momentum indicators that are moving in the wrong direction and you’ve got a pretty nasty hill to climb if you’re long with lots of resistance levels overhead."
I Revise My Stance On IBM,Oct.25.17,"Investment ThesisInternational Business Machines (IBM) could be set for a significant rebound if cloud revenue continues to increase. However, blockchain is likely to become a highly competitive space, and IBM's dominance of this technology will be limited.Therefore, I wouldn't sell IBM as there could still be some growth ahead. However, I wouldn't buy it either. There is nothing to suggest that IBM has significantly more growth potential than its peers.Investor SentimentThe sentiment on International Business Machines (IBM) has not been positive up till lately.My previous article, ""Never Mind The Cloud, Here Is What Should Excite Investors"", discussed how IBM is favourable from a risk-reward perspective due to a lower valuation, and how blockchain is a technology that could end up significantly transforming IBM's business.My views were met with two main objections from readers:1) revenues and earnings continue to go down for the company and ""financial engineering"" is merely serving to conceal this2) blockchain will undoubtedly become an integral part of the cloud infrastructure but it is hard to determine whether the company will actually make money from such a technologyQ3 EarningsClearly, investors have been put at ease by IBM's latest earnings performance:IBM had impressed significantly with its third quarter earnings growth, which came in at $3.30, higher than the $3.28 expected by analysts. Revenue was also in at $19.15 billion versus an expected $18.6 billion. This has surprised many analysts who were anticipating differently. For instance, one analyst quoted on CNBC that earnings and revenue will not grow at all for the next two years, and that ""This company is not a cloud play. This company is a legacy mainframe play, and there's nothing exciting going on here at all."""
IBM: After 22 Quarters The Turn Is Coming,Oct.18.17,"IBM (IBM) reported 22 consecutive quarters of revenue declines in a row and yet its shares are spiking. The reason; the decline in third-quarter results was almost flat, in fact, the company believes that it can post growth again in Q4 of this year. If that were to happen, it would mark an end to a very painful era over the past five years for investors.With prospects for flattish sales or even growth, IBM trades at relative cheap multiples at 13 times GAAP earnings, as the balance sheet is actually in reasonable shape, even after large buybacks (at high prices). As this could mark the first decent step into a recovery, as the company continues to underperform versus its peers, there is a prospect for multiple expansion. Even if shares trade at a modest discount compared to the market, a $200 target might be within reach if revenue growth could accelerate to perhaps >2% next year.Close To FlatIBM posted third quarter revenues of $19.1 billion, a 0.4% decline compared to last year, actually marking a dramatic improvement from the minus 2.7% decline posted for the nine months of this year.The largest technology service & cloud platform business still saw a 3.3% decline to $8.5 billion. The better news is that the cognitive solutions business became the second largest business segment, seeing revenues increase by 3.9% to $4.4 billion after that segment posted flattish sales in the first half of the year. Data analytics (Watson Health) and security applications are responsible for the growth. The low margin global business service segments saw sales being down 2.3% to $4.2 billion, as IBM actually posted solid growth in its $1.7 billion systems business and its +$400 million financing unit.Growth in higher margin areas, the impact of cost savings and overall sequential improvements in revenue trends have been helpful to margins. Gross margins were down 100 basis points to 45.9% after they are down 230 basis points so far this year. The company furthermore cut expenses in terms of SG&A as well as R&D which still runs at +$5.5 billion a year. Disappointing is a fairly big drop in IP related income, which was down more than $200 million to $308 million for the quarter."
The IBM Bitcoin Puzzle,Aug.22.17,"There are exactly zero mentions of the word ""bitcoin"" in the IBM (IBM) 2016 Annual Report and yet I firmly believe that IBM benefits tremendously from bitcoin.As far as I can tell, IBM has almost no exposure to the Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCQX:GBTC), and vice versa. However, GBTC wouldn't exist without the technology that IBM is mastering: blockchain.Here's where we can easily start:Blockchain is the technology that powers bitcoin. In other words, without blockchain there is no bitcoin. The existence of GBTC depends on Bitcoin and the existence of Bitcoin depends on blockchain. Without blockchain, GBTC cannot exist.It's also pretty obvious that the pending Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF (COIN) also depends on Bitcoin, which in turn depends on blockchain technology.In a very loose way, this dependency reminds me of how the internet depends on routers and hubs, and therefore Cisco (CSCO). It's hard for web browsers to work without an internet. It's hard for Facebook (FB) to be a social media without an internet.But I digress. Let's take a look at how IBM visually explains blockchain:Blockchain creates a full ""unified view"" of all transactions for an asset, including items like shipping containers, bonds, oil, music, and more."
Is IBM A Value Trap?,Aug.16.17,"On its face, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) looks very attractive to value investors. The stock trades near its 52-week low after falling 20% since February and currently boasts a 4% dividend yield. IBM also trades at a 10% discount to its finbox.io intrinsic value estimate which is calculated from twelve separate valuation analyses.fair value sourceThe term that is being thrown around with increasing frequency is value trap. A value trap refers to a stock that has fallen out of favor and looks cheap because it trades at a low valuation but ultimately fails to recover. Value traps are often shares that have performed very well in the past, and then after an extended period of price weakness appear to be cheap.IBM is an obvious candidate to be labeled a value trap. But is it? And, what are the signs investors should look for to confirm that it either is or isn’t a value trap?Warren Buffet recently sold a third of his IBM stake, and many investors have pointed to this as proof that the company cannot justify its current valuation.Convincing arguments can be made for and against IBM.The Bullish ArgumentThe company is in the process of reinventing itself, something it has done repeatedly over its 106-year history. The company has always moved toward higher value services and is doing so once again. They are divesting all of the least profitable legacy businesses, and investing in the cloud and AI businesses."
How Has IBM Done With $48 Billion In Buyback Money?,Sep. 6.17,"Image creditIBM (IBM) is a company that has been marked by its tremendous level of capital returns in the past couple of decades. This applies to both its prodigious dividend as well as its buyback. And while I love both when they’re well executed, IBM’s buyback has always sort of rubbed me the wrong way. I’ve been critical of the stock for a few reasons but one of the principal problems I’ve had is that IBM’s strategy has – for a long time – been to simply buy back as much stock as possible and hope for the best. This hasn’t worked – obviously – and in this article, I’ll try to quantify why it hasn’t worked and what it means for the stock going forward.I’ll be using data collected from company filings and the charts are mine.We’ll begin by having a look at IBM’s share count for the past six year-end periods to get a baseline of where its float has come from.I’ve zoomed in the scale on this chart so while this looks tremendously impressive at first glance, its actual impact is perhaps more muted. Still, over this five-year period, IBM has managed to reduce its float by 215M shares, or about 19% of the float at the end of 2011. That’s actually not bad at all in the spectrum of mega-cap stocks at just under 4% per year. And if you consider just how much money IBM has to spend to reduce its float by 4% in a year, you begin to respect what it has been able to do. In addition, if we add in the first half of this year, IBM has done another 2% or so, reducing the diluted share count by about 22M in six months. In other words, it is right on pace to continue what it has been doing recently in terms of share reductions."
IBM At 52-Week Low,Aug. 8.17,"IBM (NYSE: IBM) has reported revenue decline for 21 straight quarters now. It has tried its hand at disruptive technologies like Blockchain, cloud and security, artificial intelligence (NYSE:AI), and Internet of Things (IoT). But nothing seems to be working yet.IBM’s FinancialsRevenues for the second quarter declined 5% to $19.29 billion, missing the Street’s forecast of $19.46 billion. Adjusted earnings of $2.97 for the quarter were better than the Street’s estimates of $2.74.The earnings beat was driven by IBM’s continued drive to manage costs. Operating expenses reduced by 20% in the quarter, primarily due to headcount rationalization initiatives. However, it increased its spend on R&D initiatives which grew 5% over the year.By segment, revenue from Cognitive Solutions including Watson fell 2.5% to $4.6 billion. Global Business Services revenue was down 3.7% to $4.1 billion. Technology Services & Cloud Platforms revenue fell 5.1% to $8.4 billion and Systems revenue fell 10.4% to $1.7 billion. Global Financing revenue was down 2.2% to $415 million.Strategic Initiatives revenue for the second quarter grew 7% to $8.8 billion. Within the segment, revenue from cloud grew 15% to $3.9 billion, analytics grew 4%, mobile grew 27%, and security grew 4%. On a trailing twelve-month basis, strategic imperatives revenues grew 11% to $34.1 billion with cloud revenues at $15.1 billion and accounted for 43% of its total revenues for the period.IBM ended the second quarter of 2017 with $12.3 billion of cash on hand. Debt totalled $45.7 billion, including Global Financing debt of $29 billion. IBM’s free cash flow was $2.6 billion. IBM returned $1.4 billion in dividends and $1.4 billion of gross share repurchases to shareholders. At the end of June 2017, IBM had $2.4 billion remaining in the current share repurchase authorization.IBM reassured the market that it was still forecasting an operating EPS of at least $13.80 for the full year. The market was looking for a full year EPS forecast of $13.68."
"IBM: The Next Generation Wants A Solution, Not A Product",Sep.18.17,"International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been long renowned for selling hardware for its consumers. Not only that but also the company has been successful within this facet, providing products such as Telex tape drives, IBM computer system 360 and disk drives (floppy disks).Now whilst it is already established that IBM has quietly been plugging away at the development of hardware, it then transitioned to the artificial intelligence industry, the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) market, and then purely services. In itself this indicates to us that IBM is changing its strategy; however, a wider understanding of the market could indicate that in fact the nature of the next generation of consumers wants a solution to its problem more readily than it wants a simple product to purchase.As an investment issue, and with a focus on IBM, can this be a substantiated commentary for the world of tomorrow, and should this be something we all have in mind when we select which companies to put our money behind?IBM’s transition from hardware to servicesIn 1942, IBM provided its tabulator to the war effort.In 1980, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM agreed to put Microsoft’s operating system on IBM hardware (computers).In 1981, the IBM computer became usable and affordable for everyday people.In 1985, copies of the computer created by IBM flooded the market, making two types of computers the main forces - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM (Microsoft). It began to lose market share due to this.In 1991, IBM had decided to offer services rather than purely hardware, and at this time, it had made $6 billion from the business services it provided.In 1996, Microsoft’s market value superseded IBM’s.In 2000, the company was making $33 billion in revenue from services.In 2005, Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) purchased IBM’s computer sector, making IBM a services company rather than hardware.In 2010, IBM made $56 billion from business and technology services.In 2011, IBM became 100 years old, and passed Microsoft’s market value. AI Watson went on TV for the first time."
In 1 Chart: IBM's Financial Engineering Revealed - Workload Rebalancing,Sep.12.17,"IBM’s (NYSE:IBM) 21st Century Chief Financial Officers have lost sight of their primary duty to their corporation: spend money to make people more productive, processes more effective and products more valuable.During the Great Depression, Tom Watson Sr. shared his thoughts with the Controller's Institute of America.If the controller can find more ways to spend more money where it will expand the business, where it will bring in more orders to the factory, that will be the greatest service he can perform for the business with which he is connected.Thomas J. Watson Sr., 1932, New York, N. Y.The promise of workload rebalancingAt first blush, moving workloads to lower-wage countries would seem an intuitive and indisputably logical step to optimize profits. If this financial change addresses one of the highest expense components of a corporation’s financial spreadsheet, if employees’ wages and benefits can truly be cut by 75% to 80%, and if the new employees operate at the same or higher levels of productivity, then net income per employee should increase exponentially. At least, that was the financial promise behind offshoring workloads. Unfortunately for IBM shareholders, two out of three in the game of business isn’t necessarily a winning strategy.Workload rebalancing is an unrealized promise because the last of these conditions—operating at the same or higher level of profit productivity—has not been met. IBM has been increasing profits by lowering wages, but this has been offset by the ever-decreasing productivity of a newer, larger, disconnected, and more widely dispersed workforce."
IBM: It's Still About The Compelling Valuation,Oct.20.17,"IBM (IBM) might be the most hated big cap stock on Wall Street. One could say for good reason, primarily because its stock that has gone nowhere for years.However, like many other companies that have been in the same predicament over the years (being hated by everyone), when a company turns around, many miss the opportunity because of old biases.Now irrespective of what you thought of IBM's latest quarter, there are certain indisputable facts: The company's EPS of $3.30 beat expectations by $0.02. Revenue also beat by $550M (not a small number).Strategic imperatives revenue totaled $34.9B on a trailing 12-month basis, up 10% (in constant currency), and represents 45% of total revenue. Please note that last quarter strategic imperatives growth on a 12-month trailing basis was 7%. In other words growth is accelerating for this segment.Cloud revenue grew 20% on a 12-month trailing basis to $15.8B, representing 20% of total revenue. ""As-a-Service"" revenue increased by 24%. Expect this segment to continue rising fast well into 2018 and beyond.Security solutions grew 50%, as IBM said there is strong demand for pervasive encryption capabilities on its new z14 mainframe. In fact it also said the z14 is an ideal blockchain platform. To that extent, the company reported many new blockchain partnerships with many big well-known companies around the globe.It seems to me that this might be a pivotable quarter for the company, in the sense that cloud and certain other segments are growing fast enough, so as to make up for revenue-losing segments. If this is confirmed, then after many years IBM is probably on a path to growth once more.However growth is not expected to be much (yet anyway). And personally, I do not think the big jump in the stock had much to do with whatever growth forecasts analysts are modeling.data bydata by(TTM) data by"
IBM Is A Solid Buy At Current Levels,Jun.21.17,"I have written some articles in the recent past about why I believe International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a good investment for those who like stocks that offer a lot of shareholder value over the long term. When I started writing these articles, IBM's shares had seen a good uptrend for a while which made an investment quite risky. Since then the shares have decreased in value. While some might argue that this is a good reason to stay away from this stock, I believe that the current price of IBM's shares make it an even more attractive investment. This article is an update on my previous ones as I will explain why my thesis remains intact.Revenue is not that badAn argument that most bears currently use to explain their pessimism about the stock is the lack of revenue growth. This is true. IBM has been struggling to offer any revenue growth for a while now. But this does not mean that there is no progress or profitability. Far from it, because the developments that are seen at this company are actually quite promising.I discussed the importance of the strategic imperatives in a previous article about IBM and stated that management expects to reach $40 bln in annual revenue by 2018. And so far the company seems to be heading in the right direction.The company's strategic imperatives' revenue continues to grow despite the lack of growth for overall revenue. IBM saw revenue derived from strategic imperatives at $32.8 bln over the last fiscal year. At that time, this represented 41% of the total revenue. Last quarter, the amount of revenue derived from strategic imperatives for the ttm came in at $33.6 bln, or 42% of the total revenue of the company. Cloud revenue is growing especially as the ttm total currently stands at $14.6 bln compared to last quarter's $13.7 bln. Growth is coming along quite well in the segment. It is expected that strategic imperatives will be good for $40 bln in revenue in 2018."
IBM The Hard Way,Jul.26.17,"(Note: subscribers to Main Street Value Investor Marketplace received the first look at this research).Following International Business Machines (IBM) 21st consecutive quarter of declining year over year revenues per its Q2 FY2017 earnings release on Tuesday, July 18, 2017, my fellow Seeking Alpha contributors have posted no less than 20 articles in reaction to this seemingly endless story.During a week of multiple forensic financial autopsies, I could almost envision the approximately 270,000 real-time followers of IBM on SA scrambling in a myriad of directions, taking new or renewed stands on the company and its stock. Whether an observer is bullish, bearish, or the safer and secure neutral, right now IBM is all over the investment theses map.But let’s pretend that IBM's Q2 FY2017 theme music has stopped and we are lucky enough to find a cushioned chair to land. Take a deep breath, pull up your new found seat and join Main Street Value Investor as we weigh in on IBM the hard way, with a fundamental analysis of the company and valuation of the stock, our first research dive into Big Blue since January.Disclaimer: the crystal ball cracked early on in our investing career, so this analysis is more about the impact of what already is and how company management should react as opposed to predictions of what may or may not happen next quarter or next year with revenue, earnings, or the stock price.Do We Care That IBM Missed on Revenues?"
IBM: Will Revenue Growth Kick In?,Jul.12.17,"When IBM (NYSE:IBM) announces its 2Q17 results on July 18th after the closing bell, one key question will be on my mind: When will revenue growth finally kick in?(Credit: TechCrunch)The Street is betting on EPS of $2.75 and, most importantly, a YOY revenue decrease of -3.8% (the worst top line performance since 2Q16). If IBM beats earnings expectations, it will have done so for the 11th quarter in a row - nothing new here. The feat has been mostly achieved, however, on the back of tight opex management. While I commend IBM for its operational diligence, I believe the Street has remained skeptical about the stock (down -7% YTD versus the broad market's +9%) due to lack of top line momentum. See the graph below illustrating the company's trailing twelve-month sales figures over the past five years and slowly recovering GAAP op margins.IBM Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsLast quarter, IBM didn't quite excite me on the results of its strategic imperatives. The company's data analytics, cloud and engagement businesses grew at a moderate pace of 12%, including the negative impact from FX, which was largely in line with prior quarters. While some investors might have found solace in seeing initiatives like Cloud-as-a-Service continue to post robust results (up +61% YOY), IBM's high-growth ventures failed to fully offset the unwinding of its legacy businesses: -12% YOY in 1Q17, per my calculations."
IBM To Return To Growth Next Year,Jun.23.17,"ThesisIBM's (NYSE:IBM) turnaround is working. I estimate the company to start growing again next year. This is largely due to their strategic imperatives which have now reached critical mass. Furthermore, IBM's competitive position in the cloud is being underestimated. Investors can pick up 3.9% yield now that pessimism is high.IBM's turnaroundMuch has been said about IMB's ""strategic imperatives"", but how effective are these imperatives and how does it stack up to the competition. IBM's strategic imperatives can be broken down in three parts:1) Focus on data,2) Focus on Cloud,3) Focus on engagement.The focus on data is meant to articulate that the businesses, and the world as a whole, are becoming increasingly more data driven. This requires sophisticated analytical systems. This is where Watson comes in. Watson is a ""cognitive system"" which, according to the company, includes but is much broader than artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing.Watson aims to create learning solutions. Its aim is to interact with data just like the way humans do; learning through experience and teachers. This sounds like a lot of fancy stuff so let's take a look at the applications, as depicted by the CFO:1) ""we expanded the reach of Watson and the IBM Cloud through our partnership with Visa, where Watson IoT turns cars, appliances and other connected devices into potential points to sale.""2) ""Through our alliance with Samsung, where the weather company will be the default weather app on new Samsung devices, powering the weather experience for tens of millions of devices by the end of the year.""3) ""through our engagement with H&R Block, where we're now embedded in 10,000 branches, enabling 9 million filers to benefit from the Watson enhanced expertise of H&R Block's tax professionals."""
IBM Is At An Inflection Point,Oct.23.17,"Photo creditIt is no secret that I haven’t really been a huge fan of IBM (IBM), well, ever. I’ve found the company’s “strategy” of essentially ignoring the dying legacy business in favor of buybacks that aren't working and focusing instead on its strategic imperatives to be a losing battle. Indeed, you needn’t take my word for it; just have a look at the chart below. But upbeat Q3 earnings has the stock flying; is this finally the time to buy Big Blue?We’ll begin with the chart and I think some really important technical progress has been made on a weekly basis. The stock is now well and truly clear of the 200DMA and while the line is still negatively sloped, its downward trajectory is slight. That implies that if buyers can keep the stock in excess of the line for just a couple of weeks, it should turn higher and would then offer up some support. This was evidenced for much of last year as the rising 200DMA was strong support and it could easily happen again.In addition, the momentum indicators look very strong off of the earnings rally, with buy signals on all of them. The shorter term stochastics shows the buying started in earnest several weeks ago and the longer term MACD is confirming the move now. The RSI is even getting close to overbought territory on the weekly chart, something that hasn’t happened since very early on in 2017. All of these things imply buyers are out in force and they are all positive, pointing to potentially further gains."
"IBM: Q3 Results Are Promising, But Investors Should Remain Cautious",Oct.18.17,"On October 17, International Business Machines (IBM) reported its Q3 2017 results beating on both EPS and revenue by $0.02 and $550 million, respectively, which surprised many analysts. As a result, the stock price soared by more than 5% to the level of $154 during post-market trading hours, breaking major resistance levels.(Source: Graphiq.com)While the company's results are indeed promising and they show the signs of a turnaround, investors should still remain cautious and watch closely the future development of the company. If IBM shows similar performance at least over the next two to three quarters, the fact of a turnaround will be confirmed. In this article, I provide the analysis of IBM's Q3 earnings and the outlook for the future of the corporation.Major takeaways from Q3First of all, let us look at the numbers.Overall, the company's revenue and EPS remained nearly flat vs. the numbers of the same period in 2016. Hence, it can be seen EPS increased by $0.01 year over year, while sales decreased by 0.4% from $19.2 billion to $19.15 billion, which is not a significant decline. The Q3 revenue dynamics are presented by the graph below. It is clear the growth has not been seen in Q3 over last three years.(TTM) data by"
5 Minute Valuation Of IBM,Jul. 3.17,"Video TranscriptIBM (NYSE:IBM) is a business in the midst of a huge transition. It has undergone big transitions several times in its history and has always come out OK. But many investors, Warren Buffett among them, have doubts about IBM’s ability to make it through this time around. We have analyzed and invested in IBM successfully since 2015, and wanted to update our valuation to see if there is again an opportunity to invest.Our valuation framework focuses in on a handful of fundamental drivers of which there are only three main ones in the short-term and one related one in the medium-term. We’ll work through each one-by-one.RevenuesIBM has been divesting old businesses and trying to build new ones in certain areas it calls “Strategic Imperatives.”Figure 1. Source: Company Statements, Framework Investing AnalysisThis has been a painful process that has seen the company post 20 consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Year-over-year revenue contraction in fiscal year 2016 was confined to 2%, and several of IBM’s segments actually grew overall, so we may be nearing an inflection point.Right now, revenues from Strategic Imperatives make up roughly 40% of business and were growing at a rate of around 12% per year at last check. In contrast, the remaining portion of the business is seeing contraction of nearly 10% per year.Figure 2. Source: Company Statements, Framework Investing AnalysisFigure 3.

These 3 Charts Tell You All You Need To Know About IBM's Earnings Report,Jul.19.17,"Whether or not International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) did well or did poorly last quarter is largely a matter of perspective. The technology icon did well in the sense that operating earnings of $2.97 per share handily topped estimates for $2.74. On the flip side, sales of $19.3 billion came up short of the $19.46 billion top line the pros were looking for.Traders chose to see the glass as half-empty rather than half-full, sending IBM shares lower by a couple of percentage points. As they say, though, there's more to the story... at least now.No Shooting Star to LassoJust to set the stage properly, International Business Machines is hardly out of the woods yet. Its second quarter of 2017 marks the 21st consecutive quarter IBM has posted weaker year-over-year quarterly numbers.Still, the company finally appears to have stopped the bleeding of the bottom line. Might this be the beginning of a long-awaited turnaround?To begin answering that question, one has to take a step back and look at the company's individual pieces rather than the whole... something International Business Machines doesn't make it easy to do. It's pulling the plug on some business lines while expanding others, and each of those lines has a different profit margin profile. The data is out there, though, for those willing to ferret it out.The graphic below tells a big part of the IBM story, illustrating the fiscal trajectory for its five major divisions: Cognitive Solutions, Global Business Services, Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, Systems, and Global Financing. As they say, read 'em and weep."
IBM Down As Warren Buffett Sells,Nov.14.17,"After the bell on Tuesday, shares of IBM (IBM) were about a percent lower on the news that Warren Buffett has significantly slashed his position in the company. For those that thought things were finally starting to improve in the technology giant, the post-earnings rally has disappeared, and this negative news will only add to the pain shareholders are currently feeling.According to the latest required filing, Buffett sold more than 17 million shares of IBM during the third quarter of 2017, which represents almost $2.5 billion worth of shares if you look at where the stock traded on average during the three-month period. For those that are new to the market, this filing represented his holdings at the end of September; so there always is a delay on positions unless we hear otherwise.This isn't the first time in 2017 that Buffett has sold IBM in a big way. As I detailed back in May, we had heard how the Oracle of Omaha had slashed his position by about a third from 81 million shares at the end of 2016. Given that Buffett's holding was about 37 million shares at the end of Q3, it means that he has now sold more than half of his position this year, although we're still talking about an investment of nearly $5.5 billion.Last month, shares of IBM rallied after the company's third-quarter earnings report, one that featured top and bottom line beats. However, the EPS number was not that impressive given such a large revenue number, as margin pressures continued to weigh on a number of business segments. After rising more than 10% in the days following the report to more than $162.50, IBM shares have come right back down to where they were going into the report, as seen in the chart below.(Source: Yahoo!

"Large Cap, Growth Catalysts, 4% Yield, 19% Upside: IBM",Oct. 5.17,"We have been shareholders of IBM (NYSE: IBM) since February 2016 and were lucky enough that we started our position at $122 per share. Then, in July 2016, we wrote a bullish article on IBM and increased our position. After that article, we had the opportunity to conduct interviews with IBM executives. In the first part of our interview, we tried to understand the long-term vision of the firm. We then elaborated on Watson, IBM's cognitive system (you can find our discussion here). We then had the chance to dig deeper and have a conversation with Rob High, IBM Watson's CTO, and tried to shed some light on Watson's business model. We also interviewed Don Boulia VP of IBM's Cloud and explored IBM blockchain initiatives. After all this research, we remain positive that IBM is a good investment.Although we trimmed our position around $160 (bought back at $150), we are still shareholders. But let’s start from the beginning…In recent years, the share price of IBM has been hammered by negative sentiment. It has fallen from a peak of $215 in 2013 to $120 in February 2016, back to around $180 in February this year, to the current level of $146. Our position was wildly outperforming the market until the earnings disappointment and a partial exit of Warren Buffett pushed the stock down (IBM graph from Google Finance).We believe that the negative sentiment is shifting, and that, at current prices, this stock is an interesting investment. In fact, although the core business of IBM is in decline, the new ""strategic imperatives"" are growing substantially and will soon represent the majority of the company's sales. Blockchain also represent a potential catalyst."
"IBM: Boom, Bust, Or Somewhere In Between?",Jan.28.18,"(IBM Company Image)Despite demonstrating poor performance from 2013 to 2017, International Business Machines (IBM) has picked up momentum in the past couple months, currently boasting an elevated stock price of $167.34 as compared to previous November lows of $147. The company had experienced prolonged stock headwinds as a result of reporting consistent revenue decreases (sustained revenue decreases for 23 straight quarters), contractions in various legacy business, decreasing profits, and operational instability. However, over the past two months, IBM has outperformed its associated industry with the stock price experiencing a 10% upside from December lows to current levels in January. This article seeks to discern IBM's growth potential, assess the company's relevant financials, and predict the stock's performance in 2018."
IBM: The End Of A Long Nightmare,Feb.13.18,"International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) investors were having a tough time over the last six years. The global tech giant was experiencing declines in its revenue over this period. For many analysts, IBM was not a recommended investment in recent years, the company underperformed the market and earnings were not growing. But things have changed and 2018 is expected to be a turnaround year for IBM, and maybe will be the end of a ""nightmare"" for its shareholders.The company operates through five segments: Cognitive Solutions, Global Business Services, Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, Systems and Global Financing. IBM typically creates value by enabling new capabilities for clients that transform their businesses and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. Much of IBM's business comes from designing solutions for its corporate clients rather than selling standard products and services to customers similar to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Positive earnings release surpriseAfter reporting growth in its quarterly revenue for the first time in nearly six years, IBM is back to the spotlight. The ""strategic imperatives"" revenue accounting for 46% of IBM's total revenue involves five areas: analytics, cloud, mobile, security and social.Source: IBM 2017 Q4 earningsIBM-Maersk entering Blockchain technologyIBM recently partnered with Maersk Inc. (OTCPK:AMKAF) (OTCPK:AMKBY), the world's largest container shipping company, in order to provide an efficient new platform relying on blockchain technology. Blockchain is a digital record-keeping method known for its use in cryptocurrency payments and is expected to be used across various industries in the coming period. IBM hopes to establish this platform in order to make the global trade market faster, easier and more comprehensible to manufacturers, shippers and freight forwarders.

Has IBM Turned A Corner Or Is This Recent Rally About To End?,Jan.22.18,"IBM’s (IBM) performance and innovation has lagged the technology sector, and the general market as well for years. Many invested years ago only to find that little to no capital appreciation occurred during their time horizon. Even Warren Buffett threw in the cards last year on IBM and gave up on any hope of future growth. The real question for investors following IBM’s report on Friday is has a corner been turned? Is the company actually starting to innovate and will this result in the stock moving higher in 2018. Based on actually revenue growth generated from multiple growth drivers, and continued growth in an already healthy dividend and share repurchases IBM may finally be turning a corner as a company and as a stock.Q4 Results:For the first time in nearly 5 years, IBM was able to report revenue growth quarter over quarter. While the company did report a loss due to tax reform, the report finally offered longstanding investors a sign of hope!FOURTH QUARTER 2017Diluted EPSNet Income (Loss)Gross Profit MarginGAAP from Continuing Operations$(1.14) *$(1.1B) *48.2%Year/Year-124% *-123% *-1.9PtsOperating (Non-GAAP)$5.18$4.8B49.5%Year/Year3%1%-1.4PtsREVENUETotal IBMStrategic ImperativesCloudAs-a-service annual exit run rateAs reported (US$)$22.5B$11.1B$5.5B$10.3BYear/Year4%17%30%20%Year/Year adjusting for currency1%14%27%18%Source(IBM.com) IBM reports 2017 fourth-quarter and full year resultsOne highlight that did disappoint investors was the full year guidance for 2018, which was lowered from $13.92/share to $13.8/share. While 4% revenue growth is definitely a positive for IBM, the lines investors need to pay attention to is the incredible growth in IBM’s cloud services and strategic imperatives (particularly software) revenue streams. With a growth rate now running north of 30% for cloud services and 17% for strategic imperatives, these portions of the business may very well be the catalyst the company has lacked to drive revenue growth for so many years."
The Contrarian Case For IBM,Jan. 2.18,"What can you say about a company as widely known as IBM (IBM)? As we all know, it was one of Warren Buffett’s rare mistakes and he is quietly exiting the position. It was also the second worse performer in the Dow last year. These are facts. It has some of the greatest cognitive solutions technology in the world but the technology isn't translating into revenue and profitability growth. Not yet. IBM's revenue has declined an incredible 22 quarters in a row.The competition appears a step ahead in delivering solutions for today’s world while IBM focuses on the future. That realization hit Warren Buffett but only after his multi billion dollar bet.On the positive side of the ledger, IBM is a patent machine. In 2016 alone, IBM was granted over 8,000 patents. That bodes well for IBM’s future but doesn’t offer much for investors looking for reasonable return on investment today. Not ten years from now but in the coming years.Let's be honest, IBM today is a dog when it comes to investment returns. There's no way to sugar coat it. The Dow in 2017 generated returns north of 20%, while IBM investors lost 7%. But therein lies the opportunity for risk adverse investors looking for defensive, contrarian names to augment a diversified portfolio. With a dividend yield of nearly 4% and strong free cash flow, IBM offers a defensive approach to an otherwise over heated bull market that's long in the tooth."
IBM: The Sad Tale Of Underperformance Continues,Jan.23.18,"IBM - What should investors expect from their investments in techI confess that I have different standards than some writers on this site about what I expect from my investments. For the most part, I think investing in IT is all about growth - at some price or the other. There are names that feature growth at a reasonable price and there are names that feature hyper growth. Finally, there are IT vendors who pay significant dividends and are considered to be value names. I get that, although I rarely choose to invest in such names. But what I insist upon, overall, is some level of transparency, some level of reasonable self - evaluation and some level of market share maintenance. I do not see much of any of that in IBM (IBM). It pleases some investors because of its dividend and its cash flow. It simply doesn’t make my cut because of its self-evident problems in evolving a strategy that might allow it to grow at a rate consistent with the market or to articulate a strategy to improve its execution. I think it is unfortunate - and I could think of other terms to use - to own a position in a company that can’t at least demonstrate some kind of plan to maintain its market share or to discuss its glaring issues with some level of candor. And I think it is unfortunate for investors to conclude that IBM’s long series of quarters of shrinking revenues has really come to some kind of conclusion. It is very far from the case.Last week, two very different tech companies reported. One of those, and the subject of this article, was IBM. The other was Atlassian (TEAM) - more or less the antipode in terms of its investment features. Some commentators on this site felt that IBM’s quarter was good enough, and obviously the preponderance of sentiment has been that Atlassian’s quarter was not good enough. My view is that those conclusions, whether they bear out this day, or next week, are exactly wrong. IBM had a relatively weak quarter, bolstered by FX and bolstered by a mainframe cycle. Atlassian - well I will take up Atlassian in a different note, but suffice to say it is rare to see many companies of its scale show accelerating growth and substantial improvements in cash flow."
IBM: Don't Listen To The Negatives,Jan.18.18,"After reporting Q4 results, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is trading down in initial reaction. The stock already was up sharply in 2018, but investors shouldn't listen to any of negative reasons for dumping the stock that is causing the initial 3% dip in after-hours and encouraged sellers that already missed the rally this year, addressed in my previous article.Ignore: Revenue Growth Due To Currency BenefitsAfter 22 consecutive quarters of negative YoY revenue growth, IBM finally reported that revenues grew 3% to $22.5 billion. Strategic imperatives saw a large 17% jump from 2017 levels and exceeded the Q3 growth rate.Source: IBM Q4'17 presentationThe negatives are that currency finally benefited sales and was a big part of the tech giant finally turning around results. IBM only produced 1% YoY revenue growth when excluding the currency benefits, and strategic imperatives growth was only up 14%.The company is forecasting 2018 growth, where the analyst community was more neutral. The stock will likely rally as the company is able to convince the market that the Q4 trend will continue due to growth in areas like cloud, AI and blockchain rather than currency.IBM Net Common Payout Yield (TTM) data by YCharts"
IBM: Sellers Gone Crazy,Jan.12.18,"The investment opportunity in IBM Corp. (IBM) is further enhanced by the desire of market participants to dump the stock in the face of the company repurchasing shares at a cheap valuation. Despite the shift to strategic areas like blockchain, AI and cloud, shorts and Warren Buffett alike want to dump the stock.Inflection PointThe well-stated sales struggles are likely the prime reason used for shorting the stock. IBM, though, is on the verge of ending its 22-quarter streak of YoY declines.In the past year, the quarterly sales declines have moderated to very minimal drops, with a meager 0.4% decline in Q3. IBM has reached similar levels of nearly achieving revenue growth in the past, but analysts forecast the company finally breaking the losing stream. The analyst community forecasts a 1.4% gain in Q4.IBM Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsA possibly better way to view the picture from a shareholder perspective is the revenue per share metric. Similar to the earnings per share calculation, this measures each share's portion of revenue. Due to large stock buybacks, IBM has consistently reduced its share count along with the revenue declines.The below chart shows a pattern of the stock generally moving in lockstep with this metric. Not surprisingly, IBM is positioned to rally, as even a small bump in revenues in Q4 and into 2018 will boost the revenue per share when combined with ongoing stock buybacks.IBM data by YChartsIBM Net Common Buyback Yield (TTM) data by YCharts"

Click here to find out more »Aristocrat Status:IBM (IBM) is inching closer to Dividend Aristocrat status. After a rocky point in 1990, which entailed a change in leadership, IBM has increased their dividend for 22 consecutive years.With a healthy and solid foundation established by a long history, it is imperative that we analyze IBM and its current position in the tech economy. By doing so, we can establish whether Big Blue is an excellent purchase in the $160s or is currently correctly valued.Figure 1: Almost 25 years of increasing dividends puts IBM close to 'Aristocrat' status. (buyupside.com)General Outlook:IBM has a market capitalization of 161.4 billion and an annual income of over 11 billion. They pay an annual dividend of $6, which equates to roughly a 3.5% yield.When thinking about dividends, the first question is, can the cash flow support the dividend. Issues can be seen when looking at IBM's free cash flow. Specifically, their free cash flow has seen significant declines in the past 5 years. This raises the question of where this additional cash is going.Figure 2: Annual Free Cash Flow shows a significant dip in 2013++. This is usually a warning sign, but in this case is due to large acquisitions. (Company Filings, List of Acquisitions)"
Warren Buffett's Painful IBM Lesson - Have You Learned It?,Feb.28.18,"This February, Warren Buffett admitted he had no faith in IBM. After accumulating a huge position, by 4th quarter of 2017 he sold out almost the entire Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) position. He lost faith in IBM CEO Virginia (Ginni) Rometty, who talked big about a turnaround, but it never happened.Mr. Buffett would have been wise to stop having ""faith"" long ago. All the way back in May 2014, I wrote that IBM was not going to be a turnaround. CEO Rometty was spending ALL its money on share buybacks, rather than growing its business. The Washington Post made IBM the ""poster child"" for stupid share buybacks, pointing out that spending over $8B on repurchases had maintained earnings per share, and propped up the stock price, but giving IBM the largest debt-to-equity ratio of comparable companies.IBM was already in a Growth Stall, something about which I've written often. Once a company stalls, its oddsof growing at 2%/year falls to a mere 7%. But it was clear then that the CEO was more interested in financial machinations, borrowing money to repurchase shares and prop up the stock, rather than actually investing in growing the company. The once great IBM was out of step with the tech market and had no programs in place to make it an industry leader in the future.By April 2017, it was clear IBM was a disaster. By then we had 20 consecutive quarters of declining revenue. Amazing. How Rometty kept her job was completely unclear. Five years of shrinkage, while all investments were in buying the stock of its shrinking enterprise - intended to hide the shrink! CEO Rometty continued promising a turnaround, with vague references to the ""wonderful"" Watson program. But it was clear, Buffett (and everyone else) needed to get out in 2014. So Berkshire ate its losses, took the money and ran."
IBM: Buffett Hinted 'Sell' And He Did,Feb.16.18,"Buffett Followed Through On Exiting Berkshire's Stake In IBMIn October last year, I wrote an article titled IBM: Selling Impetus For Warren Buffett where I detailed my rationale on why Buffett would ""accelerate any stake reduction or elimination in IBM before the Congress passes the tax bill expected before the end of the year"". I posited that the largest one-day jump in the share price of IBM (IBM) since January 2009 following the better-than-expected third-quarter results provided Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A)(BRK.B) with ""a great opportunity"" to execute its sale plan.The following month, Berkshire reported that it had, in the third quarter of 2017, reduced its stake in IBM by 32 percent. The 17.06 million shares in IBM were sold at prices between $140 and $156. Taking the bottom of the price range to be conservative, Berkshire received around $2.4 billion in proceeds from the sale. At the same time, its SEC filings also showed it added 3.9 million Apple (AAPL) shares to bring its total ownership in the iPhone creator to 134.1 million shares. Taking the higher end of the range that Apple traded at in the third quarter at around $160/share, that would have cost Berkshire an estimated $624 million, which was just one-quarter of the proceeds from reducing its IBM stake.IBM data by YCharts"
Buffett's Bet In Apple Can End Up Like IBM,Feb.21.18,"Warren Buffett has increased his stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) with an addition of another 31 million shares in the recent quarter. This brings the total stake of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) in Apple to a staggering $28 billion, comprising 14.6% of the $191 billion assets of Berkshire. The scale of investment and the reasons behind this ramp up have a significant similarity to the previous mega investment by Buffett in IBM (NYSE: IBM).In 2011, Buffett broke his long-held disinclination towards tech stocks with a multi-billion dollar investment in IBM. This investment was over $10 billion at one point. At that time, IBM was seeing a decent bull run as the EPS grew rapidly due to modest growth in net income and a big reduction in outstanding shares. To jog the memory a bit, in 2007, then IBM CEO Sam Palmisano promised the company would deliver $10 EPS by 2010. The company posted much better EPS of $11.52 in 2010 which increased the bullish bet on the stock. Palmisano then doubled down on reducing more shares through buybacks and promised $20 EPS by 2015. This was known as “Roadmap 2015”.Eventually, the company saw declining revenues as the market shifted away from traditional IT solutions. IBM dumped this EPS target at end of 2014 and finally reported a EPS of just $14.92 in 2015 despite going full throttle on share buybacks. (In 2014 the company spent $12 billion on buybacks). Buffett has been reducing his stake in IBM for the past few quarters and in the latest fillings showed a mere 2 million shares worth $300 million."
IBM: A Comprehensive Analysis Shows This Stock Is In Buy Territory,Mar. 7.18,"IBM (IBM) is a Dog of the Dow, there's no doubt about it. Over the last year, only General Electric (GE) and Merck (MRK) have performed worse. With that being said, I think IBM is a bargain and things are looking much brighter for 2018. IBM is still one of the best producers of free cash flow and I don't believe enough credit is given to that. I opened up a position in IBM not too long ago and will continue adding to it. My investment thesis is based on IBM's stock having a significant amount of upside based on the following factors:IBM is expecting sales growth in 2018 as a result of its ""Strategic Imperatives."" Stock performance and valuation multiples indicate the market has not yet bought into these expectations, which I view as an opportunity.Large amounts of capital will continue being returned to shareholders. IBM's 3.82% dividend yield is the best out of all mature tech stocks. More importantly, the dividend is well supported with free cash flow and will continue to grow. Additionally, continued share repurchases will support and increase EPS.IBM has an attractive fundamental valuation based on multiple approaches. In particular, I calculated 36% upside based on a single-stage discounted cash flow model.IBM's Financial SnapshotIBM has had a rough couple of years. Revenue has declined 26% from all-time highs back in 2011, which has put pressure on earnings. In the table below, 2017 net income and EPS include a one-time charge of $5.5 billion associated with the enactment of U.S. tax reform. Full-year operating non-GAAP EPS was $13.80, which shows improvement over last year."
"IBM: Growing Again, Driven By The Dollar",Jan.19.18,"International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) ended 2017 on a solid note, as it reported accelerating revenue growth in the final quarter of the year. The results look stronger than they are, driven by the impact of a weaker dollar as that will provide a tailwind to 2018 results.Organic growth remains very modest but at least is slightly positive. Following a recent 10% jump, I believe that expectations have been running a bit high into the earnings release, as the earnings results and outlook is not enticing enough to sustain the recent run higher.Solid End To 2017IBM posted a 3.5% increase in sales for the final quarter of 2017, which is reassuring after sales have been trending lower for years now. Not to say that this trend has officially reversed as sales were still down roughly a percent for the year, but at least, based on current momentum and exchange rates, one can expect modest growth in 2018. It should be said that a softer dollar has proven to be a real tailwind, as constant currency sales growth came in at just 1% in the final quarter of 2017.The company benefits from a solid economy, internal initiatives, and the fact that shrinking business units become less important (or smaller) over time, while growing segments comprise a greater portion of sales. With exception of the financing business, IBM has four segments, and three of them showed growth in the final quarter.The largest business is the Technology Services & Cloud Platform business, and it is exactly this segment, which is posting declining sales. Fourth quarter sales were down 1.2% to $9.2 billion although the decline in sales is stabilising. Fortunately, this business posts gross margins of ""just"" 40%, roughly 5 points less than all of IBM as growing segments tend to have higher margins."

Ma'am, you may begin.Patricia MurphyThank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM, and I'd like to welcome you to our Fourth Quarter Earnings Presentation. I'm here today with Jim Kavanaugh, who was announced last week as IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as Martin Schroeter, who is now Senior Vice President, Global Markets. Prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours, and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.I'll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find the reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim Kavanaugh to start us off.James KavanaughThanks, Patricia, and hello to everyone on the call today. As a quick introduction, I've been with IBM for 21 years. I was the IBM Controller from 2008 through January of 2015 when I became the Senior Vice President of Transformation and Operations where I've been focused on driving IBM's operating model transformation. In October of last year, I came back to be Senior Vice President of Finance and Operations. I participated in IBM's annual investor briefings for the last 10 years and have met many of you. I'm now looking forward to working more closely with the investment community as IBM's CFO.Given I'm a week into the new role, Martin is going to cover the fourth quarter, and then I'll put into context our 2017 performance and how that positions us for 2018. We'll then take the Q&A together.So for now, I'll turn it over to Martin.Martin SchroeterThanks, Jim. Back in July, we planted the flag for our businesses, and we pointed to an improved trajectory in the second half. Now as we look back on the year, we did, in fact, significantly improve the trajectory in our revenue and our gross margin performance. We did this by ramping our cloud and as-a-service offerings by continuing to reinvent our systems brands, by driving a higher level of software transactional revenue and by improving consulting performance.In the fourth quarter, we returned to revenue growth. Our revenue of $22.5 billion is up about 3.5% and up 1% without the currency tailwind. We also grew our operating net income and our operating earnings per share. As you saw in our press release, our operating net income and EPS exclude a one-time charge associated with the enactment of tax reform because of the unique nature and to provide comparability to the operating expectations we've been providing for 2017. For the year, we delivered $79 billion of revenue, $13.80 of operating earnings per share and free cash flow of $13 billion, which is up over $1 billion year-to-year."
IBM's Light At The End Of The Tunnel,Jan.22.18,"Image creditIBM (IBM) was formerly one of the easiest shorts I knew of in the market. Years ago, IBM was still priced like it was a growth stock even though it was nothing of the sort but in the last few years, its Strategic Imperatives, or SI, have been slowly gaining momentum and promising to return IBM to growth. The last time I visited IBM I commented on how its perpetually lower revenue had driven margins lower and that it looked like Q4 had a chance to be the first quarter in six or so years that the company would actually produce YoY revenue growth. Q4 results did indeed show IBM with total revenue growth and while the stock certainly has some problems, I’m still cautiously bullish.The chart is supporting the bulls right nowBefore we get to the quarter, I’d like to note on the chart the position of the 50DMA and 200DMA. The shorter line turned up a few months ago and recently crossed over the longer line, creating the Golden Cross. The last time this happened was in early 2016 and it portended a sizable rally for the stock. That isn’t guaranteed again, of course, but it is something to note. In addition, the 200DMA has flattened out and should provide at least some support should the stock sell off further. It is about $12 below where the stock trades as I write this and we’re already off $9 from before the earnings report, so that looks like the line in the sand until further notice. In other words, the chart is supporting my bullish position right now as the odds look in favor of the bulls. Things change, but for now it is okay."
"IBM Is A 'Dog Of The Dow' Breaking Out On AI, Watson, And Blockchain Initiatives",Jan.19.18,"International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) is a longtime component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. As a weak stock since March 2013, it's been a 'Dog of the Dow' for several years, given its solid dividend yield, now at 3.56%.Thirty years ago, IBM was a true benchmark stock that was likely in almost every investor portfolio. The company was the mainframe giant well before the technical innovations that shrunk computers into PCs and then into handheld smartphones. In the late 1960s, I was a user of the IBM 360 mainframe computer at Grumman and as a student at Brooklyn Poly, as I completed my master's degree.IBM is such a global giant, it's has been hard to modernize the company into new business activities. This turnaround began after the stock set a multiyear low in February 2016. Back then, the recovery focused on cloud computing and AI via Watson. This month, a new initiative involving blockchain technologies has come to the surface.I have been a fan of IBM's cloud computing offering as it uses the latest mainframes as the backbone, rather than a farm of PC-based servers, which, in my opinion, are easier to hack.IBM's guidance in Thursday's earnings report mentioned strong sales in its latest line of mainframe computers.I am also optimistic about artificial intelligent applications over the Watson platform. This now includes blockchain applications.This dog is outperforming the Dow 30. IBM closed at $168.65 on Wednesday up 9.9% year to date and in bull market territory 21.2% above its 52-week low of $139.13 set on August 21. The stock is 7.7% below its 52-week high of $182.79 on Feb. 16, 2017. The Dow 30 is up 5.3% year to date."

IBM's China Foray Derailed,Jan.13.18,"In October last year, I wrote about the ambitious cloud-computing moves by Alibaba (BABA). In a span of a few days in October, Alibaba announced a flurry of partnerships with Red Hat (RHT), Xilinx (XLNX), and STMicroelectronics (STM). In that same month, Simon Hu, senior vice-president of Alibaba Group and president of Alibaba Cloud, declared that the then fourth-placed Alibaba Cloud (a.k.a. Aliyun) was ""on track"" to surpassing Amazon AWS (AMZN) to become the top provider of cloud services in the world. Later in my article, in the section on potential obstacles to Alibaba Cloud’s ambition, I brought up the collaboration between Dalian Wanda (OTC:DLWNY) (OTC:DWNDF) and IBM (IBM).Quote from the October article (emphasis added):""Dalian Wanda's Wanda Cloud Company might have found itself a solid name as a partner. However, IBM's cloud division holds just a small percentage of the entire market. It is also uncertain how much commitment Dalian Wanda has on its cloud venture given the myriad businesses the company dabbles in at any one point in time. ... The heightened scrutiny would mean that the management's attention would now be switched back to focusing on its core businesses like property development and investment. Its cloud venture would thus be relegated to playing second fiddle, reducing the immediate threat to Alibaba.""IBM data by YCharts"
"IBM Revenue Rises, Stock Falls",Jan.19.18,"After the bell on Thursday, we received fourth quarter earnings from IBM (IBM). Big Blue finally ended a long streak of revenue declines, posting its first top line increase in 23 quarters. In fact, the company announced a very strong beat for quarterly revenues, although only a one penny beat on the bottom line. With the stock rallying into this report, the early news wasn't enough to keep the stock moving higher.(Source: cnbc.com)For Q4, IBM came in at $22.54 billion in revenues, smashing estimates by roughly half a billion dollars. I was expecting a solid number from the company, primarily based on US dollar weakness, and this definitely was the case. While revenues were up 4% over the prior year period, the company noted that growth was only 1% if you exclude currency.IBM noted that strategic imperatives revenues were up 17% in the quarter, or 14% adjusted for currency. This number is certainly better than the company's overall top line, and was up significantly from the 11% growth rate seen in Q3 (or 10% after currencies). Cloud-as-a-service revenues topped an annual exit run rate of more than $10 billion, although the growth rate declined sequentially from 25% to 20% (or 24% to 18% when excluding currencies).Considering the huge top line beat, I was a little disappointed in only seeing a penny beat on the bottom line. The company reported a 180 basis point decline in gross margins over the prior year period, which was up from a 100 basis point decline in Q3. Just like we've seen in some past quarters, all five business segments showed gross margin declines. Cognitive Solutions, the highest margin segment, showed a 350 basis point decline. Technology services and cloud platforms, the largest revenue segment, saw a 200 basis point decline. Global Financing again saw a large drop, 670 basis points, although that wasn't as bad as Q3."
Tech Dividend Showdown: Cisco Vs. IBM,Feb.20.18,"The tech industry primarily provides share price appreciation potential for investors due to many companies being younger and in a higher growth phase. However, some tech companies provide attractive income opportunities, such as Cisco Systems (CSCO) and International Business Machines (IBM).IBM is a Dividend Achiever, a group of stocks with 10+ years of consecutive dividend increases. You can see the entire list of all 261 Dividend Achievers here.After IBM has gotten back on growth track recently, the prospects for both companies do not look bad, and both companies provide above-average dividend yields to income focused investors. This article will compare the attractiveness of both companies as an income investment.Company OverviewCisco was founded in the 1980s. The company is the biggest producer of switches and routers and has been diversifying and expanding into other segments such as software and security. The company has managed to decrease its reliance on hardware sales substantially, its software and services business has been growing nicely over the last couple of years.(Cisco earnings presentation)Due to subscriptions being responsible for the majority of Cisco's software revenues, there is a substantial amount of recurring revenues streaming towards Cisco. This is a plus for the company and its owners as this means lower exposure to the cycles of the hardware industry."
"IBM Q4 earnings call: FY18 guidance, tax forecast, and margin erosion","Jan. 19, 2018 8:32 AM ET","IBM (NYSE:IBM) held its Q4 earnings call (transcript) aftermarket yesterday and included FY18 guidance and more details on the quarterly report.FY18 guidance: Operating EPS flat on the year to “at least $13.80” (consensus: $13.92). FCF expected at about $12B. IBM expects a headwind from cash tax payments to the tune of about $600M year-to-year.Tax: 2018 operating tax rate of 14% to 18% (before any discretes) incorporates the new tax law and is a four-point headwind year-to-year. Management reminds investors that the company took discrete items in Q1 and Q2 last year, which brought the operating tax rate down to 7% for the year.Q4 margins: Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi mentions during the call that GBS and Tech Services margin erosion was “the worst we’ve seen in history on a pretax basis.”Operating gross margin was down a little over a point on the year and about 0.5 points behind guidance due to mix and yield delay in the Services business. Global Business Services margins were down 2.1 points to 24.8%, Cognitive Solutions down 3.5 points to 79.2%, Tech Services & Cloud Platforms down 2 points to 40.9%, and Systems down 1.2 points to 55.7%.Earnings press release.IBM shares are down 3.2% premarket.

2 Positive Catalysts Will Send IBM Higher,Jan. 2.18,"Q3 2017 ReviewTo start, let's review IBM's earnings from Q3 2017. They earned $3.30/share on $19.15 B in revenue compared to $3.29/share and $19.23 B in revenue in Q3 2016. Both the revenue and earnings were better than the consensus going in and possibly the biggest thing was that IBM came very close to breaking its 22 straight quarters of Y/Y revenue declines. The stock price immediately jumped after the Q3 numbers came out as you can see here:IBM data by YChartsIBM's Negative Revenue StreakIt is fairly well known that IBM has had 22 straight quarters Y/Y revenue declines. I've compiled the last 10 quarters of Y/Y growth rate, which does show just how poorly IBM has performed for quite some time, but also that they have been trending toward getting back to positive growth rates.While they are losing revenue in legacy businesses at a fast rate, their strategic initiatives are still growing at a fast pace and are nearing 50% of their revenues. If strategic imperatives can continue to grow around the same pace, they will out pace the rate the legacy businesses are shrinking within the next year or two.Because IBM has continued to struggle for so long, they trade at a low P/E multiple (~11.5 trailing P/E currently), especially for how much free cash flow they have and how much money they are able to return to shareholders. Being able to determine when IBM really starts to turn the corner and start seeing some Y/Y revenue gains should help time when IBM's P/E multiple starts to expand. I don't expect them to command even close to a multiple near the FANG stocks, but I do expect it to go up when they start increasing revenues again."

IBM Has Cryptomania Upside,Jan.16.18,"IBM Corp. (IBM) has had a nice start to 2018, but has failed to benefit from the cryptomania craze, started by Bitcoin, that even almost-deceased companies like Kodak (KODK) can benefit from. With a dedicated blockchain crew that dwarfs almost all of its competitors, IBM is looking to establish itself as a leader in the core benefits of the technology instead of trying to cash in on the hype. With its earnings report coming soon, after over 20 consecutive quarters of disappointments, a bounce might finally be in sight for the company as its strategic imperatives look to bring growth to the company again at long last, along with some potential hype if it makes meaningful advances in helping set up core platforms and usages for the future of blockchain.Late in 2017, IBM formed a blockchain partnership with Stellar.org and KlickEx group to speed up global payments processing. Currently cross border transactions featuring different currencies take hours if not days to process. This is because a local bank typically has to maintain a foreign account with foreign currency that it debits as required from transactions across the border. This process is time-both consuming and expensive in maintaining foreign accounts, and it ties up currency that could otherwise be used for loans or other financially beneficial transactions.Enter Stellar's Lumens cryptocurrency. Stellar is a hybrid open-sourced blockchain built specifically for payments in a global financial network. Stellar relies on anchors, or entities that people trust to hold their deposits on the Stellar network. These anchors act as a bridge between existing currencies and the Stellar network's Lumens based cryptocurrency resulting in transactions between currencies that can occur in 5-7 seconds instead of days.IBM data by YCharts"
"Buffett Buys Apple, Nearly Exits IBM",Feb.15.18,"Midway through each quarter, we get numerous filings from institutional investors on their holdings at the previous quarter. On Wednesday, we got some interesting news from Warren Buffett regarding two of his major tech sector holdings. The Oracle of Omaha is clearly placing his bet for the future on one tech giant, as opposed to one he used to favor.As detailed by CNBC after the close, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) has increased its Apple (AAPL) holdings by more than 23%. That accounts to more than 31 million shares in the quarter. At the end of 2017, that resulted in a total holding of more than 165.3 million shares, which would be almost $27.9 billion as of the last closing price of 2017, which coincidentally is just around where Apple shares are trading now. Buffett's ownership percentage is now more than 3% of Apple, which likely will increase as the company's buyback continues.On the flip side, Buffett has nearly exited all of his position in IBM (IBM), which for many years was one of his core holdings. As I detailed in an article last May, the IBM position was around 81 million shares at the end of 2016. As CNBC detailed, that stake is now down to just 2.05 million shares after selling off roughly 94.5% of the position in Q4 2017. While Berkshire was still the 4th largest IBM shareholder at the end of Q3 2017, that is no longer the case.Last year, Buffett had talked about IBM being a strong company, but also being up against strong competitors as well. While IBM finally reported a revenue increase for the first time in 23 quarters recently, the stock has been dead money for some time. Just take a look at the five-year chart below showing Apple against IBM for the past five years."
Intel Inside: Why I Sold Intel And Bought IBM,Jan.18.18,"""I'm not upset that you lied to me, I'm upset that from now on I can't believe you.""- Friedrich NietzscheSource: IntelA few months back I made a comment on an article, from SA contributor Mauro Solis, titled: Micron Technology: It Ain't Over Till Optane Sings. The comment was nothing more than a simple response to someone who was wondering why insiders/company executives seemingly sell at what seems like a bad time to the investor. Here is a copy of my quote:Reasons executives sell stock are:(1) They need to sell in designated approved windows.(2) Wife wanted a new house.(3) To pay taxes.(4) To ""mess"" with the heads of everyone here on SA.1 and 3 are most likely... but I find #4 intriguing. :)Oct 12, 2017. 10:08 AM LinkOf course, #1 is the right answer as most of us know. However, it is tough to resist the chance to be cheeky every now and then.I bring this up because I was reminded of the quote when I decided to sell every single share of Intel (INTC) that I had accumulated over the past eight years.I did make a very nice profit as many of my shares were in the $19 to $20 range, but I'm very upset about it. I wanted to hold onto them longer. I had a sizable position in Intel and an even larger position in Micron (MU). I follow many authors on here (Electric Phred, William Tidwell, et.al) that expect both of those companies to be huge in AI, IoT, data, and autonomous vehicles. But, as much as I wanted to keep my Intel shares, I had to sell.Why, you ask? Well, there are three very large reasons:"
