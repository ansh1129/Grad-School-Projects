This Guy Used Reddit to Build a Crowdsourced Stock Portfolio. The Results Were Actually Not Bad ... Kind Of,"Dec 22, 2013 at 10:31AM","Late last year, Reddit user PhantomPumpkin began building a simulated portfolio. Over a three-week period, he invested $10,000 in play money into any stock talked about positively on the subreddit r/investing. Is this a viable portfolio building strategy for the long term? Absolutely not. But it is incredibly interesting. In the anonymous, Wild West world that is Reddit, how would the communal Internet fare against the efficiency of the global stock market?To find out, I updated his portfolio with current prices as of today, one year later.Let's get right to it. How'd he do?Over that three-week period, 30 individual stocks were virtually purchased. Each investment represented $10,000 in play money. Because of what I can only determine to be rounding errors, the total investment ended up totaling $288,713.54.Today, the portfolio is worth $404,015.97. That's a 39.9% return in roughly one year. Not bad at all.But it's not enough to just accept this near 40% return without benchmarking it against alternative parking spots for your money. Forty percent sounds great, unless you could have returned 60% somewhere else.Compared with the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, this portfolio performed quite well. The S&P is up 27% over the past year, and the Dow is up 23%. The Russell 2000 though is up 35%. The Reddit portfolio still wins, but only slightly.Taking a deeper diveOverall, the portfolio saw 10 stocks lose money, while 29 made money, and one was a push. Of the 30 investments, seven returned greater than 100%! Leading the way was Acadia Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ACAD), returning 359%, followed by MannKind, returning 136% and AcelRX Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ACRX) returning 122%.Only one investment lost more than 50% of its value: OXiGENE, which lost 52%.Notice a pattern emerging? Redditors, for whatever reason, seem to really like pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Other big winners -- Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI), Seagate Technologies, and First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) -- while not drug or bio companies, are high-risk, high-reward companies that bet on the future of technology.To see the portfolio, I've uploaded the spreadsheet for viewing here.A better approachWith only 30 stocks in this portfolio, and with such a heavy weighting toward technology, biology, and pharmaceuticals, is 39.9% really a good return? My instinct tells me no.In my judgment, this risk profile here far exceeds that of the Russell 2000, and absolutely the S&P or Dow Jones Industrials. And it far exceeds what the risk profile for most investors should be as well!So should you begin checking r/investing everyday for the next big investment opportunity? Absolutely not!The key to investing is doing your own homework, understanding what companies actually do, what makes them successful today and tomorrow, and then investing for the very long term. Don't put your nest egg, your future, your children's future, at such undue risk based on advice of the anonymous masses.In the game of investing, slow and steady wins the race.

Can Marvell Technology Beat Out Broadcom and LSI?,"Nov 19, 2013 at 2:30PM","Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ:MRVL) will release its quarterly report on Thursday, and investors have seen the stock soar to its highest levels of 2013 as interest rises in the company. Yet even as certain technology stocks have started to gain traction among investors recently, can Marvell outpace rivals Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM) and LSI (NASDAQ:LSI) to capture the maximum growth available from the industry?Marvell Technology has three main segments in which it operates, making products related to the networking, storage and mobile and wireless businesses. In storage, its hard-disk-drive controllers have provided a regular stream of cash for years. But the increasing importance of mobile and wireless solutions has given Marvell the chance to sell connectivity-enhancing chips and integrated processors for smartphones and other mobile devices. Networking is also an area of high potential for Marvell, as Broadcom and other competitors have also seen great success there. Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Marvell Technology Group over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.Stats on Marvell Technology GroupAnalyst EPS Estimate$0.25Change From Year-Ago EPS25%Revenue Estimate$872.81 millionChange From Year-Ago Revenue11.8%Earnings Beats in Past 4 Quarters3SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCECan Marvell earnings keep growing?Analysts have boosted their views on Marvell earnings in recent months, raising their October-quarter estimates by $0.01 per share and their full-year fiscal 2014 projections by $0.05 per share. The stock has climbed about 7% since mid-August.Marvell worried investors early in the quarter, despite reporting July quarter earnings results that by several measures were stronger than most had expected. Storage controllers for both hard-disk drives and solid-state drives saw solid growth, and successes in mobile could arguably offset the challenges that Marvell faces in its networking segment. Still, Marvell's failure to keep up with Broadcom's networking growth led investors to bid shares lower.In addition, Marvell looks increasingly likely to lose a major legal verdict. The company had hoped to have a federal court grant a new trial to overturn an outstanding $1.17 billion jury verdict in a suit that Carnegie Mellon University had filed in a hard-drive infringement case, but that request was denied in September. Marvell intends to appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit once its post-trial motions are all resolved, but it's uncertain whether it will fare better at the appellate level.But one major issue that emphasizes Marvell's potential advantages over Broadcom and LSI came earlier this month, when rumors that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts had bought a 5% position in Marvell raised speculation about a full-out takeover bid. KKR believes that Marvell could win its lawsuit, freeing up more than $1.7 billion in cash to help make a leveraged buyout a lot easier to manage. Moreover, KKR's confidence that the decline in the PC market won't hurt Marvell's hard-disk drive business as much as many fear helped give shareholders the bullishness to drive share prices higher.In the Marvell earnings report, watch to see the extent to which the company keeps relying on Western Digital, which accounted for almost a quarter of Marvell's overall sales in its previous fiscal year. If it can continue the trend of getting rivals like Seagate on board, then Marvell could press its advantage against LSI and Broadcom well into the future.10 stocks we like better than Marvell Technology GroupWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

PetSmart Reports That No One Is Buying Pet Fish,"Dec 6, 2013 at 8:28AM","The pet fish industry is currently navigating troubled waters. PetSmart (NASDAQ:PETM) executives noted in their third quarter earnings call on Nov. 22 that the entire aquatics category is ""challenged."" As a result, company executives are focused on serving existing customers since there aren't any new ones entering the market.Indeed, the pet fish industry has been stagnant since Disney (NYSE:DIS) Pixar's 2003 animated film Finding Nemo sparked new interest among families to buy their own personal Nemos. In the aftermath of the film, families went out and purchased 185 million freshwater fish, according to the American Pet Products Association (APPA).Since then, however, the pet fish industry has been unable to maintain that momentum. In 2007, there were only 142 million freshwater fish sales, per the APPA. During the same year, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) announced that it would stop selling live pet fish at many of its stores and would decrease floorspace for all of its aquatics products. The reason given at the time was ""lowered customer demand."" Most recently, ownership of freshwater fish has remained steady at 145 million, says the APPA. Losing NemoPet stores and retailers have less incentive to push fish sales compared to other animals. This is because the real money maker for these companies lies with pet food. Some $21.26 billion is projected to be spent on pet food in 2013, nearly half of the total $55.53 billion that pet parents plan to spend on their pets, reports the APPA. Even PetSmart's earnings are dependent on consumables. Some 54.5% of the $1.7 billion PetSmart generated in revenue during the quarter came from pet food sales. Meanwhile, Spectrum Brands (NYSE:SBH), which sells fish food under the Tetra, Marineland, Perfecto, Jungle, and Instant Ocean brands, reported in its third quarter earnings call on Nov. 21 that its pet category delivered a net sales record of $25.9 million, driven largely by ""continued growth in North American aquatics."" Of course, Spectrum's strong revenue is largely because the company basically holds a monopoly on fish food sales through its various sub-brands.  Even the hungriest fish is likely to annually consume only one or two cartons of fish food that cost an average $7.99. By comparison, rabbits can consume a similarly priced bag of pellets each week. So it makes sense that retailers would focus their shelf space and sales staff on the more profitable animals.Bubbling back up?Now, there are some signs that the pet fish industry is about to experience another upswing.For one, ownership appears to have bottomed out in 2006 at 139 million freshwater fish and now remains relatively consistent, per the APPA. Simply put, it's not dramatically declining year after year. Plus, one of the most popular preschool TV series right now is Nick Jr.'s Bubble Guppies, which likely will encourage children to want their own ""Little Fish"" characters. Lastly, PetSmart is embarking on a new partnership that executives hope will reignite the pet fish market. In spring 2014, PetSmart is introducing an exclusive collection with National Geographic that includes branded habitats, accessories, and food. However, it remains to be seen if PetSmart and National Geographic plan on introducing fish castles based on National Geographic's popular Doomsday Preppers series.10 stocks we like better than PetSmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Seagate’s Shrewd SandForce Acquisition,"May 29, 2014 at 10:00PM","When Avago (NASDAQ:AVGO) purchased LSI a while back, it got with it a robust storage semiconductor business, as well as a networking chip business that seemed poised to grow. As part of that storage semiconductor business, Avago got its hands on a company that LSI had acquired just a few years ago called SandForce. SandForce was an up-and-coming vendor of solid-state drive-storage controllers, and helped the company stay competitive with Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL), as well as the in-house controller efforts at the various flash vendors.However, news broke today that Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), one of the two major players left in the hard disk drive business, would be buying SandForce from Avago for a cool $450 million in cash. Seagate, like rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), has been on a bit of a shopping spree with respect to any and all flash-related technologies. While hard disk drives will continue to be a veritable cash cow, neither Seagate nor Western Digital wants to be left out of the continued growth of flash.This is a good acquisitionLSI picked up SandForce for $370 million back in 2011. Back then, SandForce's controllers were continuing to gain traction, but were still relatively immature relative to some of the offerings from competitor Marvell, as well as some of the in-house solutions from the likes of Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF). Under LSI, SandForce likely had more financial room to breathe and, as a result, could be more competitive in the longer run.With this acquisition, Seagate gets a strong flash controller vendor, which will allow it to be a major player in both consumer and enterprise solid-state drive solutions. While Seagate is at a cost-structure disadvantage relative to a company that builds its own NAND (think Micron (NASDAQ: MU), Samsung, and Toshiba) because flash is easily the biggest part of the bill of materials, this is really only a hindrance in commodity-drive markets. In higher-end consumer and, more importantly, enterprise, the software and the controller are the key points of differentiation.Welcome to the club, SeagateWith Toshiba having picked up the remains of OCZ, which had a pretty credible in-house controller effort, and with Western Digital having picked up STEC, it's only natural that Seagate joins the party by picking up some world-class solid-state controller IP. Indeed, with the substantial cash flows that both hard disk drive vendors generate from this duopoly, it would be foolhardy for either to not be aggressive in picking up relevant flash assets.Impact on Marvell?One more angle is worth exploring, and may be expanded upon in a future article -- the impact on Marvell. Marvell is a leading vendor of hard disk drive controllers and has reported excellent growth from its solid-state drive controller business. The company estimates that it has roughly 50% of the controller market for such drives, and has indicated that the near-term demand outlook for this business is good.The longer-term question, however, is whether the merchant solutions that Marvell provides will ultimately be displaced by in-house solutions, or if the merchant model will ultimately prevail. The smaller, commodity SSD players (Corsair, Kingston, PNY, etc.) are unlikely to bring controllers in-house -- even Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) uses merchant controllers for its consumer products -- so that market is probably nice and wide open to Marvell. The drives that come from Seagate, Samsung, and others, on the other hand, will probably use in-house silicon. Time will tell how the market share dynamic between all of these players plays out.Foolish bottom lineSeagate is using its enormous cash flow from hard disk drives to buy technology and assets that it needs to thrive longer term. Hard disk drives aren't going away -- in fact, they'll probably continue to generate robust levels of cash for years to come; but in order to drive growth, both Seagate and Western Digital need flash strategies. It seems with their recent acquisition sprees, both Seagate and Western Digital are well positioned going forward.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

How Much Did Jack in the Box's $38 Burger Really Cost?,"Feb 16, 2014 at 2:30PM","PHOTO CREDIT: FLICKR/KEONI CABRAL.Last August, a guy ordered one of the most expensive fast-food burgers in the world at a Jack in the Box (NASDAQ:JACK). The 20-patty burger, which also included several strips of bacon and cheese, stood about 12.5 inches tall and was an estimated 9,044 calories. The price tag on that monstrosity was $38.23. While that was the monetary cost of the burger, it wasn't its true cost.The carbon cost of beefBeef production takes its toll on the environment. According to the Meat Eater's Guide to Climate Change + Health, beef has the second largest carbon footprint of the 20 most common foods it compares. Only lamb has a worse carbon footprint.The reason cows and sheep score so poorly is due to their digestive process, called entric fermentation. The process creates a substantial amount of methane, which is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. On top of that, the nitrous oxide these animals leave behind has the warming potential that's 300 times greater than carbon dioxide.Consequently, 90% of beef's emissions are created when it's in the production phase, or when the cow is simply growing up. Chicken, on the other hand, produces half of the emissions of beef during the production phase because chickens don't produce any methane. Not only that, but chickens require much less feed per pound of protein, which lowers emissions from feed production as well.The Meat Eater's Guide puts these 20 foods into the carbon footprint equivalent of driving a car. Its findings suggest that consuming 4 ounces of beef is the carbon equivalent of driving just over 6.5 miles. Chicken, on the other hand, has the carbon equivalent of driving just over 3.5 miles.PHOTO CREDIT: JACK IN THE BOX.Adding up that Jack in the Box burgerThe adventurous burger builder based his $38.23 creation on a Jumbo Jack burger. To find the carbon footprint of that burger, we need to know how much beef it contains. The tricky part is that Jack in the Box actually never says how much beef is in its Jumbo Jack burger, and a call into its guest-relations department came up dry. However, in comparing similar burgers, the general consensus is that the Jumbo Jack burger is about a quarter-pound, or roughly four ounces of beef before it's cooked. That puts it a bit bigger than the 3.2 ounces of beef found in a Big Mac, though roughly in line with a quarter-pound burger. Add up the 20 patties on the Jack in the Box monster burger and we have roughly 80 ounces, or about 5 pounds of beef.Again, using the Meat Eater's Guide, every 4 ounces of beef is the carbon footprint equivalent of driving 6.5 miles. That puts the estimated carbon footprint of this mammoth Jack in the Box Burger the same as driving 130 miles in a car.Food for thoughtDriving a car more than 130 miles is actually what I'd have to do in order to reach my nearest Jack in the Box. So the burger buyer doesn't need to worry, as I've already offset his carbon footprint. However, by knowing more about the carbon footprint of the foods we eat, as well as the nutritional value, it can steer us toward making better overall choices. While I'm never one to turn down a good burger, knowing that chicken is the better meat is something that can help me make the tough choice between two dishes if it's a toss-up.10 stocks we like better than Jack in the BoxWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

How Seagate Technology Is Morphing Into a Company for the Future,"Jul 2, 2014 at 10:00AM","Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is one of the world's leading enterprise storage products manufacturer. The company accounts for 37% of all laptop hard disk drives, or HDDs, sold around the world, and is on target to sell about 70 million desktop HDDs in fiscal 2014. Seagate also manufactures enterprise cloud storage products, as well as TV, DVR, and console storage products. Close peer Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) accounts for almost half of global laptop HDD shipments.The decline in global PC sales, as well as the growing preference for solid-state drives, or SDDs, and hybrid drives, to traditional HDDs has been taking a heavy toll on Seagate's topline growth. The company managed to ship only 7.7 million its enterprise storage units in the third quarter of 2014, a modest 2.5% year-over-year growth compared to 7% growth for the comparable quarter in 2013. To cope with these industry headwinds, Seagate has adopted several strategies that range from making strategic acquisitions that strengthen its promising businesses, to changing its product mix to reflect industry trends.Strategic acquisitionsSeagate acquired Xyratex, a leading provider of data storage technology and testing equipment maker, for $374 million in 2013 to enhance its enterprise storage offerings. Seagate now operates Xyratex as a stand-alone unit.Xyratex owns several key businesses. The company is a premier provider of HDD testing equipment. The average capacity per drive is growing rapidly, and HDD test time is also rising. Seagate will use Xyratex's HDD testing equipment to streamline its own HDD supply chain.Prominent hard disk manufacturers such as Toshiba and Western Digital use Xyratex's HDD testing equipment. Xyratex has about 3 million test slots installed worldwide using its legacy Drive Processing Systems that enhance factory yields.Xyratex has two other main businesses, ClusterStor HPC storage hardware business and OneStor, which is an enterprise data storage business that manufactures embedded storage and other storage application products. Xyratex's ClusterStor and OneStor businesses make it the largest OEM storage disk manufacturer that serves heavyweight clients such as HP and NetApp.The Xyratex acquisition will give Seagate pricing power over other HDD manufacturers. It will also help the company reduce HDD manufacturing costs and maintain competitive HDD pricing. This is important in the current environment of falling HDD prices. The average HDD unit selling price fell from $63 in 2013 to $61 currently.Xyratex's contribution is likely to become accretive starting from the current quarter, by adding about $100 million to its top line.Seagate acquired Avago Technology's LSI flash business for $450 million in cash in May.The flash business is important for Seagate because of the increasing popularity of SSDs; SSDs use flash components. The LSI flash business will help Seagate on two fronts. First off, sourcing flash components is likely to become considerably cheaper for Seagate, which will help the company offer more competitive SSD prices. Second, it will help the company integrate a leading technology in its SSD products, which will give it leverage when negotiating SSD prices with customers in the future.Although the LSI acquisition will add a mere $40 to $50 million per quarter to Seagate's top line starting from fiscal 2015, small acquisitions can sometimes bring a lot more to a company's table than just top-line growth. Think of Cisco's Insieme ac for $863 a million in 2013, or VMware's acquisition of Nicira for $1.26 billion in 2012. These acquisitions were relatively small compared to the size of the companies that bought them. Yet, the two acquisitions have given both Cisco and VMware a sizable lead over their competitors in the SDN, or software-defined networking, market, which is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 80% to reach $35 billion by 2018. Cisco's and VMware's SDN strategies are currently regarded as the ones most likely to gain traction in the market.Seagate is using a similar strategy to hedge its SSD bets, by making small but highly strategic acquisitions. SSDs are not likely to fully replace HDDs any time soon because of their high cost. SSDs are, on average, 7-8 times more expensive per unit storage than HDDs.SOURCE: ZETTA.But, with chip companies such as Intel releasing CPUs with more cores and more cache each year, traditional disk technology has been lagging behind CPU technology, which has resulted in a significant performance gap. However, this shortfall represents a huge growth opportunity for SSD that can help to fill disk I/O performance and latency.HGST, a Western Digital Company, predicts the enterprise SSD market will grow from 5.8 million units shipped in 2014 worth $3.8 billion, to 13.1 million units shipped in 2017 worth $6.7 billion, equivalent to CAGR of 21%. That implies the ASP of SSDs might fall 22% over the next three years, making them even more affordable.ConclusionThe disk storage market is gradually moving toward higher-performance solid-state disks. Although there is no clear consensus on when SSDs will become mainstream, Seagate is making the right moves that will help it dominate this important market once it reaches maturity.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons Why Seagate Technology Is a Top Dividend Stock,"Sep 29, 2014 at 5:11PM","SOURCE: SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY.When most dividend investors think about where to find promising stocks, the technology sector isn't the first place most of them look. Yet despite a reputation for stinginess in the dividend department during the 1990s and 2000s, tech stocks have recently made a big splash with payout increases, and hard-disk drive specialist Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) has demonstrated its commitment to rewarding shareholders over the past 10 years with rising dividends, albeit with some hiccups along the way.Seagate is best known for its position aside peer Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) as the biggest players in the hard-disk drive market. Yet as the PC has given way to mobile devices that use storage devices based on other technologies, Seagate hasn't let the pace of innovation leave it behind. Let's look at three reasons Seagate has the potential to be a top dividend stock for years to come.1. Seagate has an impressive dividend history but has periodically gone through challengesSeagate has followed the same general pattern that tech investors have seen more broadly in the past decade, as maturing companies realize that returning capital to shareholders through dividends has broad appeal. From modest beginnings in 2003 with a roughly 1% yield, Seagate steadily boosted its payout over the years, paying quadruple that initial amount by 2008.STX DIVIDEND DATA BY YCHARTSYet one thing dividend investors never like to see is for a company to suspend its payouts, and that's exactly what Seagate did from early 2009 through 2011. The financial crisis forced Seagate to stop paying dividends for the two-year period to preserve cash, with anticipated savings of $60 million making a meaningful difference to the drive maker's cash flow. Yet in 2011, Seagate returned to dividend-paying status with a vengeance, making up for lost time with a payout half again as large as its pre-suspension amount and then more than doubling that amount in less than three years. At current levels, Seagate's yield is 2.9%, almost twice what Western Digital pays.2. Seagate's traditional hard-disk drive business has found new lifeSOURCE: SEAGATE.For years, many industry analysts looked at the trend toward falling PC sales and declared that companies that relied on PC technology were doomed to obsolescence. In the long run, that might be true, but other PC-reliant companies have recently reported a renaissance in desktop-computer demand. That bodes well for ongoing demand for Seagate's historically strong hard-disk segment.In addition to overall PC demand, Seagate has found ways to market its hard drives for other applications. In particular, the push toward data analytics has led to a huge increase in the need for storage capacity among large enterprises, and finding the right mix between cost-effectiveness and easy access has given new life to the traditional hard-disk drive space. Even as technology presses forward, Seagate should see a constant stream of cash from its less exciting storage products, and that should provide valuable cash flow to finance dividends well into the future.3. Seagate has evolved toward newer storage technologySOURCE: SEAGATE.Seagate isn't just banking on the hard disk drive to provide its future revenue. Recent acquisition moves have bolstered its position in the enterprise storage segment, with Seagate's purchase of the LSI flash business of Avago Technology earlier this year helping the drive-maker build up its presence in the solid-state drive arena. With a cheaper source of flash components, Seagate should be better able to compete in solid-state drive production, which most analysts expect to soar in the coming years. Western Digital believes that the enterprise solid-state market will more than double in shipment volume between now and 2017, and although cost reductions will make revenue grow at a slightly slower pace, there's clearly plenty of growth prospects in newer storage technologies.Seagate Technology isn't necessarily the first place investors would look for a top dividend stock. But with an attractive combination of strength from its existing core hard-disk drive business and growth potential in newer technologies, Seagate is worth a closer look for those seeking both current income and possible higher stock prices in the future."
Is This Quiet Street in Ireland Costing Americans Millions of Dollars in Lost Taxes?,"Aug 10, 2014 at 12:40PM","FITZWILLIAM PLACE IN DUBLIN IS HOME TO MANY BUSINESSES AVOIDING U.S. TAX RATES. IMAGE SOURCE: GOOGLE STREET VIEWThe quiet Dublin street seen here is actually a bustling avenue of American business. At least 10 U.S. corporations have incorporated themselves in Dublin with official addresses on or very near Fitzwilliam Place. I'm talking about drug manufacturers, insurance companies, and even tech giants basing their tax bills on Irish law while running their businesses from American soil. By doing so, they're giving their tax bills a massive haircut and boosting their bottom-line profits by millions of dollars every quarter.The strategy is known as a tax inversion, and it's a hot topic right now. If you're looking for an indication of just how inflamed the discussion is, both Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert have made fun of the strategy recently. That's a big stage for a pretty obscure business strategy.The tax-efficient strategy involves an American company buying a smaller business headquartered somewhere like Ireland or the Netherlands, where corporate tax rates are lower. The smaller and more tax-efficient subsidiary then takes official control of the larger business, moving the nexus for tax calculations abroad. At least six such deals currently are under way -- and I'm just counting companies large enough to rank on the S&P 500 index.How big a difference can these tax moves make to a company's bottom line? Let's look at some historical examples.EATON'S DUBLIN HEADQUARTERS SIT INSIDE THE RATHER ANONYMOUS FITZWILLIAM HALL BUSINESS CENTER. IMAGE SOURCE: GOOGLE STREET VIEW.One of the most recent tax inversion transactions occurred in 2012, when industrial titan Eaton (NYSE:ETN) moved its taxable base of operations from Beachwood, Ohio, to Dublin, Ireland.Eaton bought its Dublin-based rival in electrical supplies, Cooper Industries, for $11.5 billion in cash and shares. Technically, the buyout created a new holding company with headquarters in Dublin. The stock still trades on the New York Stock Exchange, and all official filings are stamped with the Dublin address. This new entity immediately shouldered official control of the entire businesses of Eaton and Cooper, but the operational headquarters never left Ohio. Even the former Cooper operations have contact addresses and phone numbers in Ohio and Texas -- not Dublin.So Eaton most definitely pulled a tax inversion. Did it make a difference? I'd say so.In 2011, which was Eaton's last full fiscal year before closing the Cooper deal, the company set aside $201 million for income taxes on pre-tax income of $1.55 billion. That works out to an effective tax rate of 12.9%. It's a far cry from the official 35% American corporate tax rate, thanks to a bevy of deductions and tax credits.But moving to Ireland kept the tax man even further away. In 2013, Eaton only earmarked $11 million for tax payments on $1.88 billion in pre-tax earnings. The effective tax rate: 0.6%.Bottom-line earnings arguably gained from the newfound tax efficiency -- something like $230 million.There's no question that Eaton's new tax strategy is paying dividends. Earnings skyrocketed while tax rates plunged.ETN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.One could also look at an industry with only two serious competitors, in which one took the lower tax rates abroad and the other stayed incorporated in America.I'm thinking about computer hard drives. After a bevy of buyouts, the names to consider in this space are Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX).Both companies have their operational headquarters in California. Seagate hangs out in Cupertino, at the heart of Silicon Valley. Western Digital's officers prefer the even sunnier skies in Irvine, on the south side of Los Angeles.Like many American corporations, Western Digital is officially incorporated in the business-friendly district we know as Delaware. The company claims 78% of its sales outside American borders, putting much of its income in tax-friendlier markets. Like all tech companies, Western Digital also enjoys an even larger number of innovation-based tax credits than Eaton ever did. Its effective tax rate was a measly 7.7% in the 2014 fiscal year, reported last week.That's hardly an oppressive tax burden. But Seagate can still one-up its biggest rival.WELCOME TO SEAGATE'S DUBLIN HEADQUARTERS, JUST DOWN THE STREET FROM EATON'S TAXABLE CENTER. SOURCE: GOOGLE STREET VIEW.The Cupertino-based company has bounced around various tax-efficient incorporation sites over the last decade, with a long stint in the zero-tax Cayman Islands. But regulations changed in the Caribbean paradise, and Seagate found a new reportable home in -- yup -- Dublin, Ireland. Seagate's Dublin address is a comfy five-minute walk away from Eaton's taxable center.In the just-reported 2014 fiscal year, Seagate rode its Irish connection to a net tax credit of $14 million on $1.56 billion in global sales. That's the net result of Ireland's low 12.5% corporate tax rate, along with Seagate's arsenal of tax credits and deductions.Seagate's negative effective tax rate is not a fluke, but rather a sustainable trend. Try as it might, Western Digital can match its rival's tax efficiency only in extreme cases, such as when Seagate took a one-time tax hit in 2011 for its move across the Atlantic.STX EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.That's why Chiquita Brands International (NYSE:CQB) wants to move to Ireland. The fruits and vegetables distributor currently labors under a 41% effective tax rate, so it could use the Emerald Isle's lower base tax.Walgreen (NASDAQ:WBA) is heading to Switzerland for much the same reason. The Swiss corporate tax rate has fallen from 21.3% to 17.9% over the last eight years, while the convenience retailer sends 37% of its pre-tax earnings to Uncle Sam these days.Then again, 100% of Walgreen's sales come from its all-American store chain. The company holds a 45% interest in a much smaller U.K. and Latin American drugstore chain called Alliance Boots, but the income from that foreign adventure amounts to a rounding error on the income statement.Buying out the rest of Alliance Boots would place as much as 25% of Walgreen's sales outside American borders, opening the door to a much bigger global market. And Alliance Boots just happens to have its headquarters in Bern, Switzerland. Completing this partial buyout could be the ticket to much smaller tax bills.The Foolish (tax) takeawayTax inversion moves can put a big dent in corporate tax bills, providing a large boost to after-tax earnings. If Western Digital could reduce its income tax to zero, it would have added $0.11 per share to its fourth-quarter earnings -- a quick 9% improvement.Are these businesses simply fulfilling their duty to shareholders, or are they stealing tax dollars from the American government? That's an ethical quandary for you to ponder. For some, the tax-reduction strategy makes Seagate a better investment than Western Digital. For others, Eaton and Walgreen become ""sin stocks,"" balancing the bottom-line benefits against patriotic scruples.But there is no question whatsoever that tax inversions can boost bottom-line earnings. Even Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart would agree, while gleefully ripping into the moral structure behind the strategy.10 stocks we like better than EatonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Google and Amazon Launch Cloud SSDs: Trouble Ahead for Western Digital and Seagate Technology?,"Jul 8, 2014 at 10:15AM","Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) launched SSDs and cross-region load balancing on its Google Cloud Platform in mid-June this year. Google Cloud users with applications that require higher performance will now be able to tap the new SSD persistent disks at a cost of just $0.325 a month/GB. Each unit storage will support up to 30 IOPS per unit of storage, or input/output operations per second. Using 1TB of data would offer 30,000 IOPS and cost $325.Never one to be outdone by a rival, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) quickly followed up by launching its own general purpose SSD-backed volume storage for AWS barely a day later, in a style that was reminiscent of the cloud pricing wars we witnessed early this year. The Amazon SSD is capable of bursting up to 3,000 IOPS per volume, and is ideal for use by small to medium-sized databases in test and development environments, as well as boot volumes. Users will only pay for the storage they provision, with prices starting as low as $0.10/GB.What does this new development mean for the leading storage products manufacturers Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX)?Low enterprise cloud uptake limits the damageWestern Digital and Seagate Technology concentrate on selling storage products such as HDDs and SSDs to enterprises. Western Digital accounts for almost 50% of global laptop HDDs shipped and about 16% of global notebook SSD shipments. Meanwhile, Seagate Technology accounts for about 37% of global laptop HDD shipments.The two companies also sell enterprise cloud storage products, however, mainly to data centers and large businesses. These are high-performance enterprise disks with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies such as network assisted storage (NAS), WD XE, and WD RE that are used for mission critical and near-line applications. Western Digital expects to ship 33 million enterprise and cloud storage units in fiscal 2014 at an ASP of $163 and a gross margin of 36%. Seagate Technology, on the other hand, expects to ship 35 million enterprise cloud units at an ASP of $146 and a gross margin of 27%.The SSD market is still quite small, and HGST estimates that 5.8 million SSD units worth $3.8 billion will be shipped in fiscal 2014. However, SSDs are increasingly becoming popular in the enterprise sector, and HGST estimates the SSD market will grow at a CAGR of 21% to reach $6.7 billion by 2017. A cloud storage service that offers SSD-backed storage could be an attractive proposition for many organizations.At the moment, however, there is little danger posed to Western Digital and Seagate Technology by AWS and Google Cloud. The bulk of companies still rely on internal storage to store their mountains of data. A Gartner study done in 2013 revealed that just 2% of organizations had shifted their core ERP systems to a public cloud.SOURCE: GARTNER, JANUARY 2014With large public clouds offering SSD-backed storage at very affordable prices, there is a possibility that more organizations, especially smaller ones, might find their storage services a good bargain and decide to shift their workloads to these clouds. Since Western Digital and Seagate mainly sell their cloud storage products to organizations, a big shift to public clouds could mean less business for them.This is not likely to be big problem, however. The AWS and Google Cloud SSD-backed storage seems tailor-made for small and medium-sized businesses, while Western Digital and Seagate mainly sell their cloud storage products to large organizations. Additionally, more companies are opting for hybrid clouds instead of using public clouds exclusively. Hybrid clouds encompass a private and public cloud strategy, where some workloads are shifted to the public clouds while more sensitive data is retained in private clouds. A 2013 survey done by 452 Research found that 68% of organizations plan to deploy a hybrid cloud in the next two years.This obviously means that these companies will still need to build their own private clouds and will continue purchasing cloud storage products from the likes of Western Digital and Seagate.What it means for AWS and Google CloudFor AWS and Google Cloud, SSD-backed storage could be a decent revenue stream. AWS is the largest public cloud, and brought in an annual revenue of around $4 billion in 2013. Google does not break down its cloud revenue.Using the number of Google Cloud users (120 million by the end of 2013) and taking Microsoft's recent revelation that 25% of OneDrive users were paying customers and applying it to Google Drive, we arrive at an estimate of $2 billion revenue in fiscal 2014. Paying users with larger chunks of stored data are perhaps more likely to use SSD-backed storage, which would mean a new sizable revenue stream for the public clouds.AWS, however, bears an edge over Google Cloud because of its Direct Connect hybrid strategy whereas Google Cloud lacks a hybrid strategy. Windows Azure employs a vendor-agnostic strategy that allows other vendors to connect seamlessly to it. That could be the main reason why it's the fastest-growing of all public clouds.ConclusionWestern Digital and Seagate Technology are not likely to be materially affected by the SSD-backed storage of AWS and Google Cloud. These cloud services are designed with smaller users in mind, while Western Digital and Seagate mainly sell their cloud-based storage products to large organizations.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons to Choose Western Digital Corp Over SeagateTechnology PLC,"Jun 4, 2014 at 12:00PM","The storage drive industry is a duopoly with Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) leading the way. Both companies were on an equal footing last year with a 43% share of the hard-disk drive, or HDD market. However, Western Digital has scooted ahead with a 45% share, while Seagate lags behind with 40% of the market. And based on a few simple assumptions, I think this gap could widen further. Difference in performanceThe PC market is on the decline, so both Western Digital and Seagate are expected to see weakness in their business. There was a time when both companies were reporting terrific growth in their financials as the floods in Thailand restricted supply. But now, both storage companies reported a decline in earnings and revenue in their respective quarters.However, it seems Western Digital is the one that's doing better in a weak PC environment. In its last-reported third quarter, Western Digital's revenue was down just 1.6% year over year, while earnings dropped 4%. In comparison, Seagate's revenue dropped 3.4% and earnings fell 5%. Difference in fundamentalsA closer look at the two balance sheets also shows Western Digital's superiority. The company has more cash and lower debt, with figures of $4.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. So, Western Digital's debt is almost half of the amount of cash. The story is the opposite for Seagate, which has debt of $3.5 billion and cash of $2.3 billion. In addition, Western Digital's operating cash flow for the last year stands at $2.8 billion, better than Seagate's $2.4 billion. Thus, Western Digital has a stronger balance sheet and generates more cash. Also, a lower amount of debt means that it has to bear lower interest expenses, which is why the company can easily hike its dividend. The company currently yields 1.90% with a payout ratio of 25%. Meanwhile, Seagate has a higher dividend yield of 3.30%, but it also has a higher payout ratio of 36%. So, Western Digital looks the more likely of the two to increase the dividend at a faster rate since it is in a better financial position.Enterprise businessWestern Digital is aggressively focusing on tapping the enterprise market. Its enterprise-class solid-state drives, or SSDs, are witnessing strong demand from customers. So, the company is focused on expanding its range of enterprise SSD products -- such as SAS, PCIe, and SATA -- with different form factors and capacities.Western Digital's 6 TB-helium filled drive is being shipped in volumes to several original equipment manufacturers across the globe. On the other hand, Seagate's 6TB enterprise drive was introduced in the last quarter. It's expected to gain momentum in the second half of the year, when enterprise cloud customers adopt higher-density drives. However, Seagate has fallen behind Western Digital in this market, as the latter is already seeing strong shipments of its own 6TB drive. Moreover, earlier this year Seagate announced that it would buy data-storage company Xyratex for $374 million to boost its enterprise data storage systems business. Also, Seagate has just announced the acquisition of the flash components division of LSI from Avago Technologies for $450 million, to tap the growing flash-storage market. Western Digital made such moves last year when it acquired Virident Systems and sTec, for a total of $1 billion, to bolster its enterprise division and flash storage hardware business. The Virident acquisition should help Western Digital tap the PCIe market -- which is growing at an annual rate of 31% and is expected to be worth $2.4 billion by 2016. In addition, the sTec acquisition has brought more than 100 SSD patents to Western Digital, according to AnandTech. As such, it seems that Western Digital has maintained the lead in enterprise storage and is a key reason why it could outperform Seagate going forward.The bottom lineWestern Digital looks like a better bet than Seagate for a number of reasons. It is financially more sound, it gained market share, and has made an early move into enterprise, all of which sets it apart from Seagate.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

How to Prepare for a Stock Market Crash,"Sep 7, 2014 at 2:40PM","We never want to see the stock market crash, but it's always a good idea to prepare for the worst, especially when the market just keeps going up, up, and up. At some point we'll at least see a correction, but some experts think the inevitable rise of interest rates could create a massive drop in the markets, and some experts are even calling for a 60% crash.While I personally think this is a little too dramatic, the reality remains that there really hasn't been a significant market drop in five years. So, let's take a look at a few rules that could help your portfolio survive whatever happens.Get out of the high-risk, high-reward names...When a correction or crash hits, the type of stocks that get the worst of it are high-volatility stocks. Some names that come to mind are Seagate Technology, First Solar, and Morgan Stanley, although there are tons of stocks that qualify. These companies certainly have fantastic long-term potential, but also have the most potential to lose money if things go bad.To determine if you are vulnerable to huge price swings in a correction, one good metric to take a look at is the ""beta"" of the stocks you own. Most stock quotes you find, whether through your brokerage or through a website like Yahoo! Finance, put the stock's beta right on the quote page, so it's easy to find.Basically, a stock's beta tells us how reactive it is to market swings. A beta of exactly 1.0 tells us that the stock should move right along with the S&P 500. If the index rises by 2%, so should the stock.A beta of more than 1.0 tells us that a stock tends to react more violently to swings in the market. For example, if a stock has a beta of 2.0, and the market drops by 10%, you can expect about a 20% drop. Now, this isn't an exact science, and any company- or sector-specific events can move a stock no matter what the market is doing. For example, during the 2008-2009 crash, bank stocks were much more volatile than their betas might have indicated.So, for those stocks I mentioned at the beginning of this section, a quick look reveals that Seagate has a beta of 2.5, First Solar's is 2.0, and Morgan Stanley's is 2.1. In other words, all of these stocks are at least twice as sensitive to market moves as the average S&P 500 stock....and buy some ""boring"" stocksTo best position yourself before a crash or correction, you want to be in low-beta stocks that pay dividends and also have a good record of raising the dividend. Companies like Procter & Gamble (0.4 beta) and Johnson & Johnson (0.6 beta) come to mind, as they have raised their dividend for 57 and 51 years, respectively. And for some more ideas, a great list of the best dividend growth stocks can be found here.But won't these underperform when the market does well? Sure, but that doesn't matter too much. In fact, it's more important to outperform during the bad years. A stock that loses 33% during a bad year needs to gain 50% just to get back to even, while a stock that loses just 10% needs just an 11% gain to do the same.Consider a simplified example of two investments, one high-beta, and one low-beta. The high-beta stock gains 20% during the good years, but loses 15% during bad years. And the low-beta stock gains just 12% during good years, but loses just 5% in bad years. For simplicity's sake, let's say that we have two good years, followed by two bad years, and then the cycle repeats.Well, after 20 years, the low-beta stock will have delivered more than four times the gains of the high-beta stock. Of course, this is a very simplified example, but it's easy to see the effect that avoiding big losses, even at the expense of some big gains can have on your portfolio.Doing well during the bad years can make you richThe savviest investors know that outperforming the market during the bad years, even if you underperform when the market is up, can make a huge difference when all is said and done.SOURCE: MARK HIRSCHEYIn fact, it is this principal that has allowed Warren Buffett to deliver his astonishing long-term performance, even though he regularly underperforms the market when the S&P rises by 15% or more. Over the past 50 years, the S&P has produced negative returns in 11 years, and Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio has outperformed the market during every single one.So, if you're a little worried about jumping the gun and shifting your portfolio to ""defense mode"" too soon, don't be. Sure, if the S&P continues its rally and ends up hitting 2100 later this year, you'll probably lose out on some gains. However, when a correction does come (and it will, sooner or later), your defensive strategy will leave you in a much better position than those investors who stayed in the ""it"" stocks a little too long."
3 Reasons Western Digital Corp's Stock Could Fall,"Sep 30, 2014 at 10:00AM","Investors have seen many investments soar over the years, only to come crashing down as unpleasant business realities overwhelmed positive sentiment. Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) hasn't been such an investment, as its soaring share price of late has reflected strengthening fundamentals in the two-horse race to hard-disk drive (HDD) dominance:WDC Total Return Price data by YChartsWe recently examined three reasons why this strong performance might continue, but informed investors would be well-served to examine both sides of the coin. No business is impregnable, and Western Digital faces several major challenges that might leave investors holding a loss over the coming months or years. Do these threats loom larger than its opportunities? Let's take a closer look to find out.The hard disk drive market has flatlined in recent yearsWestern Digital and rival Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) have both put together strong performances over the past few years, but their financial gains have masked one important fact -- HDD shipments have been slowly dropping for years:Find more statistics at StatistaBetween them, Western Digital and Seagate now sell more than eight out of every ten HDDs shipped worldwide, but both have slid from a post-recession sales peak in 2012. Western Digital shipped 11% fewer units in its latest quarter than it did during the same quarter in 2012, and Seagate shipped 20% fewer units in its latest quarter (both companies reported fourth-quarter earnings for the June quarter) than it did during the same quarter in 2012.It's important to keep in mind that the fourth quarter of 2012 was a historically high-volume quarter for the industry, but even so, unit shipments have not yet progressed from that point. We looked at Western Digital's market share gains as a factor in its favor in our last analysis, but the company's unit shipments have been effectively flat for years even as it has grabbed share from Seagate:PeriodSeagate Unit Shipments Western Digital Unit Shipments Q4 201265.9 million71 millionQ1 201358 million62.5 millionQ2 201358.2 million59.2 millionQ3 201355.7 million60.2 millionQ4 201353.9 million59.9 millionQ1 201455.7 million62.6 millionQ2 201456.6 million63 millionQ3 201455.2 million60.4 millionQ4 201452.5 million63.1 millionSOURCES: SEAGATE AND WESTERN DIGITAL SEC FILINGS.Western Digital may be able to improve its financial performance by boosting margins or streamlining its manufacturing, but if it fails to boost its unit sales going forward, its long-term prospects won't be particularly bright -- especially since HDDs have been losing ground to other storage formats in recent years. That brings us to our second risk ...Western Digital has no real foothold in SSDs or in NAND flashThere's more than one way to store a file. Western Digital is the leading provider of HDDs, but it barely registers when it comes to more portable options -- it has no position in NAND flash memory, which is typically found in smartphones and tablets, and its enterprise solid-state drive (SSD) segment made up a mere 3% of revenue in its latest quarter.Despite several SSD-centric acquisitions in the last couple of years, Western Digital's revenues from this product line are insignificant compared to the estimated $19.4 billion in revenue the entire SSD industry will generate this year. This is quite a bit lower than the $28.9 billion in revenue Western Digital and Seagate combined to earn in their latest fiscal years, but keep in mind that the SSD market's total revenue was only $9.2 billion in 2012. One segment is booming and the other has flatlined, and Western Digital is leading the flat segment.Western Digital's lack of NAND flash manufacturing capacity is also likely to crimp its progress, as NAND is used to manufacture SSDs. Vertical integration is evidently helping the big players in NAND succeed in SSDs as well -- Samsung is the largest supplier of both products, with SanDisk and Micron also among the largest suppliers by revenue of both NAND and SSDs. HDDs aren't going away just yet -- not so long as many large tech companies continue building out massive cloud storage divisions -- but their importance is diminishing in a world of more mobile, more portable storage options.Western Digital's valuation is near its highest level in many yearsSome of Western Digital's growth in recent years is certainly due to a rebound from insanely low valuations -- both its P/E and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios were among the absolute lowest of any billion-dollar company not two years ago:WDC P/E Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsSince the start of 2013, Western Digital's P/E has risen from just 5.2 to 14.6, and its price-to-free-cash-flow has rebounded from 3.6 to reach 10.8. Both improvements represent valuation expansion of almost 200%, and since Western Digital's EPS and free cash flow have both declined since the start of 2013, this means that its share price has grown entirely on the back of strong investor sentiment:WDC EPS Diluted (TTM) data by YChartsHDD manufacturers have long suffered from low valuations (Seagate's P/E was microscopic for years), but the thing about valuations is that they tend to revert over time, especially if the company's underlying fundamentals don't show the strong growth that can justify higher-than-average ratios. An economic downturn could easily send Western Digital's valuations back to low single-digit territory, and when (not if) that happens, its shares are likely to fall quite a bit if the bottom line doesn't soon show marked improvement.Three good reasons?Business history is littered with the corpses of companies that dominated their industries until a better technology came along. No one now expects hard disk drives to fade into obscurity, but few people expected mainframe computers to be completely eclipsed in 1977 (when the first PCs arrived) either. Investors who've thrilled to huge returns from Western Digital's stock should be aware of the risks it also faces -- but it's up to you to decide whether or not these risks are grave enough to sell off your position today.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Anatomy of a Modern Pump and Dump,"Jul 23, 2014 at 9:10AM","From September 1999 to February 2000, a 15-year-old made more than $250,000 pumping and dumping penny stocks.It was the largest financial frauds of its time, especially given that the perpetrator wasn't even old enough to drive. The man, Jonathan Lebed, is possibly still at it today, depending on who you ask. And he's not alone.The anatomy of a pump and dumpThe pump and dump scheme is simple. Find a stock that trades cheaply, ideally with normally light volume, and buy in early. Send out bulk email spam, promotional postcards, and other materials promoting its surefire potential to be the next big winner.If you reach the right people, enough eager buyers will send the shares flying. That's exactly what happened with Cynk Technology (NASDAQOTH:CYNK), a company with just $39 in cash to its name and only one employee. The company reached its peak price this July, hitting a market cap of $6 billion on the promise to create some sort of social network.CYNK DATA BY YCHARTS.However, the SEC suspended trading in the stock from July 11 to July 24. When it opens, it will likely crater, as demand for shares in an unprofitable, asset-poor company find a more realistic valuation that's closer to $0.How pumps and dumps have changedI'm not entirely convinced there are undeserving losers in the modern pump and dump. Virtually everyone with a brokerage account has heard of the scam. And it seems that more and more people are hopping on pumped stocks just to make a quick buck, knowing full well the risk of buying valueless shares.Case in point: the myriad of websites that serve as databases for stock promoters.A quick trip through Google led me to StockPromoters.com, which highlights the involvement of at least three different firms in promoting Cynk Technology to their email subscribers. It even shows the date of the promotion, and the change in trading volume following any given promotional email. It's as if the website serves as a ""who's who"" in promoting terrible stocks to millions of people.The message seems to be that there's money to be made gambling on the promotional abilities of the worst of the financial world.On Twitter, I found countless messages from daytraders who note that while Cynk Technology is obviously not worth its valuation, the price could just keep going higher. Many of them have positions. It's completely backward thinking -- buying in the anticipation of someone paying just a penny more per share -- but for some, it seems like a cheap way to gamble.Who's to blame?Some want to blame the SEC and FINRA for halting the stock. After all, the regulatory agencies prohibited the stock from going higher, curtailing the profits of early investors who would earn obscene returns from the gullibility of later buyers.Then again, there has to be at least a few people who were misled into thinking Cynk Technology was actually a top stock pick. If you're one of them, I'd love to hear from you in the comments below. I'm sorry you were duped.But for those who got in for the sake of riding a scam for all it's worth, I have little sympathy. The stock market isn't a place to gamble -- it isn't a place to double up on those who will certainly lose all they have. The stock market serves as a place to provide permanent capital -- equity capital -- to businesses that offer valuable goods and services to their customers.Cynk Technology isn't that company. Neither are the hundreds of stocks that a promoted day after day, year after year. Be careful out there, things can blow up in your face. If at any point a disclaimer notes that a promoter was paid to tell you about a stock, you can bet that it is a surefire scam.10 stocks we like better than CYNK TECHNOLOGY CORPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Will Acquisitions Slow Avago's Growth?,"Jul 14, 2014 at 2:30PM","Semiconductor maker Avago (NASDAQ:AVGO) has grown revenue wildly over the last year, due largely to its successful position in wireless communications and wired infrastructure. In addition, Avago made a big acquisition earlier this year, buying fellow chip maker LSI for $6.6 billion, and it is also preparing for a second, smaller acquisition . These deals will strengthen Avago's technology portfolio and give the company stability. But, will they also slow the rapid growth that Avago has experienced?A big yearRevenue at Avago has grown between 19%-25% year over year for each of the last three quarters. This growth has been driven by the ongoing LTE rollout in China, as well as key accounts with wireless handset giants Samsung and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). In the most recent quarter, the wireless and wired segments grew a staggering 25% and 43%, respectively, and now account for over 80% of Avago's income.AVAGO STOCK PRICE AND REVENUE GROWTH. SOURCE: YCHARTS.This growth looks likely to continue throughout the year for several reasons. First, Avago's FBAR filter technology has gotten a huge boost in demand from the spread of LTE phones, as it allows these phones to rely on a greater number of frequency bands. Second, the LTE rollout is still in the early stages in China, and it is beginning to take off in the rest of the world as well, which will drive both wireless and wired demand. Finally, Apple's expected release of the iPhone 6 later in the year will also contribute to demand for Avago's wireless products.The acquisitionsLast December, Avago announced that it would buy LSI, a provider of storage and networking controllers, for $6.6 billion in cash, a deal that closed this May. Avago immediately divested part of this acquisition, selling LSI's flash controller business to storage provider Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) for $450 million in cash, since this segment did not fit in with Avago's long-term strategy, according to management. The rest of the LSI business is expected to strengthen Avago's position in the wired infrastructure market, as well as give it a leadership position in the storage controller market.Avago also recently announced that it intends to buy PLX Technology for approximately $300 million in cash. This deal, which is expected to close in Avago's fiscal fourth quarter, should further strengthen the company's storage and networking portfolio.The expected growthAs a result of the LSI acquisition, Avago's revenue in the third quarter is expected to be between $1.32 billion-$1.4 billion, almost double the revenue from the same quarter last year. Looking down the line, the LSI products should effectively help balance out Avago's high-growth, potentially volatile wireless business. Avago's CEO, Hock Tan, confirmed as much, stating that the company is now composed of two fast-growing segments, wireless and wired infrastructure, and two stable segments, storage and industrial.Over the next 12 months, the wireless and wired segments are expected to continue to grow quickly. According to management, storage and industrial will probably grow in the low-to-mid single digits, and the entire company should see growth in the high single digits, or low double digits.What this means for investorsFollowing the beginning of revenue expansion last year, Avago's stock price has almost doubled. It seems inevitable that some of the share-price growth was not just a rational response to Avago's improved performance, but was due in part to investors' excitement over a hot and rapidly expanding company.Avago remains a good company, and in fact, the large LSI acquisition made it more diversified and more stable. However, it is not clear whether the current high price can continue to increase, or even hold once the more modest growth rates become apparent to the investing public. With its combination of stable and growing business segments, Avago will probably make for a good long-term investment, but it might make sense to wait until the excitement over its recent growth abates.10 stocks we like better than Broadcom LtdWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons Why Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Is Still Worth Buying,"Jun 4, 2014 at 11:00AM","Marvell Technology's (NASDAQ:MRVL) superb run shouldn't stop any time soon. The chipmaker has gained more than 120% in the last year and a half due to solid demand for its chips that are used in storage devices and smartphones. Going forward, Marvell should continue enjoying tailwinds from the roll out of LTE in China by China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) and rapid growth in data storage.Let's take a look at the three key reasons why yinvestors should hold onto this outperforming tech stock.LTE in China is big businessSince last year, LTE deployment in China has been moving at a solid pace, and Marvell seems to be making the most of it. In the first quarter, Marvell's mobile and wireless business grew 30% sequentially, driven by LTE ramps in China. The company saw a number of tier-one OEMs launch LTE smartphones based on its solutions as shipments exceeded expectations. In addition, Marvell claims that nearly half of the best-selling LTE phones in China are based on its platform. The company is slated to gain more traction in this market by powering multimode LTE devices from leading OEMs. The market for LTE handsets in China is huge. China Mobile is aggressively rolling out its TD-LTE network as it plans to build 500,000 base stations by the end of 2014. This is way above its earlier expectation of building 200,000 base stations this year. Also, China Mobile is spending significantly on smartphone subsidies in order to push the adoption of LTE handsets.In fact, China Mobile expects to sell as many as 100 million LTE handsets this year. This number is expected to reach 300 million in 2017, according to research firm iSuppli. Hence, rapid growth is expected in the Chinese LTE handset market, which should continue driving Marvell's mobile business.Storage prospectsMarvell counts the two biggest players in the storage market as clients -- Seagate and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). In fiscal 2014, these two customers together accounted for 36% of Marvell's overall revenue. The company is seeing an improvement in the storage business despite a slowdown in the PC market, primarily due to next-generation hard-disk drive technologies and solid-state drives.Moreover, the enterprise storage space presents a big opportunity for Marvell to sustain its growth in storage. The company is gaining content at Western Digital, its top North America-based HDD customer, and this looks like a significant catalyst.According to Jim Mueller of The Motley Fool, data storage is expected to grow to 6,000 exabytes in 2020 from just under 1,000 exabytes in 2014. This growth will be primarily driven by enterprise systems that Western Digital is trying to tap through product development moves and acquisitions. The company acquired Virident Systems and sTec last year to strengthen its enterprise portfolio. Moreover, Western Digital is also seeing opportunity in hybrid drives. According to Gartner, hybrid HDD shipments are projected to rise to 126.9 million units by 2018 from just 3.4 million units in 2013. Thus, Marvell seems to be in a solid position to benefit from the storage market as a result of its relationship with Western Digital.Attractive fundamentalsDespite recording solid gains in the last 18 months, Marvell's valuation is still quite attractive. The stock trades at 22 times last year's earnings, and the multiple comes down to just 13 on a forward P/E basis. This is value territory for a company that recorded 20% year-over-year growth in revenue and a 94% jump in earnings in the previous quarter. Also, Marvell doesn't carry any debt and it has a strong cash position over $2 billion. Finally, Marvell pays out a dividend of 1.50% at a payout ratio of just 34%. As the company's revenue and earnings are growing at a rapid pace, I won't be surprised if it hikes the dividend going forward.Final wordsAll in all, Marvell ticks all the right boxes from an investor's point of view. It is growing at a fast rate, has a strong balance sheet, and the prospects in its end-markets are bright. All this makes Marvell a company worth looking into.10 stocks we like better than Marvell Technology GroupWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Dicerna Pharmaceuticals Inc Stock Skyrocketed,"Jun 30, 2014 at 5:01PM","Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over market movements, we do like to keep an eye on big changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.What: Shares of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:DRNA) are trading over 20% higher today following the company's pre-market press release announcing positive preclinical trial results for DCR-PH1.So what: Dicerna recently presented preclinical data on the aforementioned DCR-PH1 at the latest Primary Hyperoxaluria Workshop in Chicago. The drug is a treatment for primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), which is a rare inherited liver disorder that often results in severe kidney damage. Dicerna's study involved genetically modified mouse models, which showed a 97% reduction of the HAO1 gene thought to be responsible for PH1 in their livers after just one dose of DCR-PH1, and which also showed near-baseline levels of urinary oxalate.Dicerna plans to begin phase 1 (human) trials for DCR-PH1 next year. According to Dicerna's press release, PH1 afflicts anywhere from 300 to 900 people in the United States (its estimated prevalence is one to three cases per million people), and they must often undergo kidney and liver transplants to avoid death.Now what: The mouse data was certainly encouraging, but there's a big difference between curing a few mice and helping a specific human patient population. It's likely to be years before DCR-PH1 reaches commercialization, if it actually does, and Dicerna's track record as a public company -- shares are still over 50% below their IPO price -- indicates less optimism than caution regarding the company's prospects. Keep in mind that even if Dicerna charges patients $100,000 a year to take a commercialized DCR-PH1, and it successfully reaches all of a potential 900 patients, the drug would still be worth roughly $90 million a year in revenue -- hardly blockbuster status, even considering Dicerna's tiny market cap. I'd watch from the sidelines for now."
SanDisk Corporation Will Buy Back $2.5 Billion of Its Own Stock. Hooray?,"Feb 6, 2015 at 8:30AM","Despite the fact that we are now more than 5 years into an aging bull market, companies continue to plow billions into share buyback plans. Why just last month SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) announced plans to repurchase another $2.5 billion worth of its own shares. That's on top of the $500 million or so in buybacks already authorized under its previous repurchase program. But is this a savvy financial move to scoop up cheap shares, or a misguided attempt by management to support the stock price after its post-earnings collapse?SNDK TOTAL RETURN PRICE DATA BY YCHARTSToday, we'll find out, as we ask two basic questions:Can SanDisk pay?Well, not right away, at least. Not all at once. But the almost $2.3 billion in cash that SanDisk currently possesses -- plus its nearly $2.8 billion in long-term investments that can be converted to cash -- give SanDisk ample dry powder to complete its buyback.And even if it weren't enough, S&P Capital IQ data show that last year, SanDisk generated more than $1.46 billion in positive free cash flow from its business. That's enough to pay for the entire buyback in cash, without touching a penny of SanDisk's reserves.Should it pay?Granted, SanDisk also has $1.2 billion in debt on its books. Might it not be prudent for SanDisk to think about paying that down before committing cash to buybacks? Well, it depends. While busy paying down debt, for example, SanDisk's share price might rise -- and management might miss an opportunity to buy it back cheaply. So, let's take a quick look at the stock's valuation relative to its peers -- and see if now is actually a good time to buy the stock ""on the cheap"":  P/EDividend Yield5-Year Projected Growth RateTotal Return RatioSanDisk18.11.6%16.8%1.0Western Digital15.01.6%8.4%1.5Seagate12.93.7%6.2%1.3Micron9.2-15%0.6PEER COMPARISONS COURTESY OF FINVIZ.COMWith its stock trading for more than 18 times earnings, SanDisk seems the priciest stock on the computer memory ""block"" -- at least at first glance. But there are a couple of factors in SanDisk's favor that bear mentioning.First and foremost, according to analysts who follow this industry, SanDisk boasts the fastest growth rate on offer -- a blazing hot 16.8% annualized. Combined with the stock's modest 1.6% dividend yield, this adds up to a ""total return"" ratio of 1.0. Judged by the valuation yardstick of master investor John Neff, who invented the concept, this suggests SanDisk's stock is indeed cheap enough to be worth buying at today's prices.When you consider further that SanDisk generates 44% more free cash flow than it reports as GAAP net income, the stock may be even cheaper than that. Valued on free cash flow, SanDisk shares carry only an 11.4 P/FCF ratio -- which is very cheap given the projected growth rate.Meanwhile, relative to the lower-P/E, but slower-growing competition, only Micron comes close to SanDisk for total return on a shareholder's investment. And unlike SanDisk, Micron is currently generating significantly less free cash flow than it reports as GAAP profits -- suggesting the ""bargain"" price on Micron may be more illusion than reality.What it means to investorsLong story short, I don't see any really good reason for SanDisk not to buy back its shares today. They're cheap by one measure (P/E), and even cheaper by another (P/FCF). Meanwhile, the SanDisk's positively loaded with cash, and looking for a good place to invest it. If you ask me, investing this cash in buying back undervalued SanDisk shares is a smart move.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Why Seagate Technology PLC Fell 14% Thursday,"Oct 15, 2015 at 1:27PM","PHOTO: SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY.What: Shares of Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) fell as much as 14.2% on Thursday morning. The maker of traditional hard drives and other data storage products released preliminary first-quarter results in the early morning hours, triggering a stampede to the exits.So what: When the full results are published at the end of the month, Seagate now expects to report revenues of approximately $2.9 billion. Gross margins will land at roughly 24%. These figures are down from Seagate's original guidance, which pointed to sales of $3.0 billion and 27% gross margins. And of course, analysts had been toeing the official sales guidance line, so the final report will most likely fall short of analyst expectations.Now what: Seagate CEO Steve Luczo blamed the weak margins on low interest in the company's biggest drives at 4 TB and larger. The company sees this market segment as a growth opportunity, and still hopes to see demand picking up in the back half of the calendar year.On the upside, Seagate also noted that its adjusted operating expenses will come in 3% below original guidance thanks to effective cost controls. But these $15 million in cost savings are just a drop in the bucket, and won't be able to outweigh the negative combination of disappointing sales plus thin gross margins.Weak preliminary reports are often seen as the canary in the coal mine, signaling larger issues across entire industries and market sectors. Not this one, though. Seagate's only remaining true rival, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), fell as much as 5.7% on Seagate's news, but quickly bounced back to a far smaller overnight decline. Sector neighbor SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK), which focuses on high-speed Flash storage rather than spinning magnetic disks, actually rose as much as 3.2% instead, entirely ignoring Seagate's bad news.It bears mentioning that SanDisk is embroiled in buyout rumors, with Western Digital posited as one of its potential suitors. Seagate's name hasn't come up in the early rumors, even though the company most certainly could use a turnkey Flash drive solution such as SanDisk.10 stocks we like better than SanDisk CorpWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Seagate Technology Down 30% Year-to-Date -- What Should Investors Think?,"Jul 23, 2015 at 1:40PM","SEAGATE 1-YEAR STOCK CHART, DATA BY YCHARTS.It's been a rough year for Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), to say the least. Shares of the hard-drive maker are down approximately 30% year to date, due to rising fears that the deterioration in the PC industry this year will spread to manufacturers of PC accessories, such as the hard drives that Seagate produces. Seagate essentially confirmed these fears when it reduced its financial targets for the current quarter.But while things look bad, the stock could be an opportunity for investors who aren't afraid of taking a contrarian view. Shares of Seagate have been beaten down so badly this year that they're now cheap. Here are the key factors weighing on Seagate in 2015, and why the stock may be worth holding anyway.The bad newsUnfortunately, there's a lot of bad news out there. Signs are popping up all over the place that the PC market is in really bad shape.Technology research firms IDC and Gartner both found that PC shipments are down significantly this year. Gartner's research indicated that global PC shipments fell 9% year over year in the second quarter.IDC's findings were even more troublesome -- it estimated that worldwide PC shipments declined 11% in the same period. These are striking numbers that would represent the steepest quarterly decline in the past two years.One of the reasons for sluggish PC demand could be the upcoming release of Windows 10. In addition, PCs face tough comparisons this year, as PC shipments last year benefited from a large refresh cycle, particularly in the enterprise market. Third, PCs are struggling because a greater share of computing is being performed on mobile devices like smartphones.This hurts Seagate because of the rippling effect to PC-related accessories, such as data-storage devices. Because of this, earlier this month Seagate cut its forecast for revenue and gross margin for its recently-ended fourth fiscal quarter.The company now expects $2.9 billion in revenue for the quarter, a steep reduction from its prior forecast, which called for $3.2 billion-$3.3 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin will likely clock in at 27%, about 1.5 percentage points lower than previous expectations.Management attributed this to lower-than-expected demand, without offering much in the way of specifics. Fortunately, there is an investment case to be made for Seagate if the difficult operating climate improves going forward.The good newsAt the very least, Seagate's huge stock price drop this year has left the stock cheap, which could lure investors attracted by the low valuation and high dividend. Seagate stock trades for just 11 times forward earnings estimates and 1.1 times revenue. Its enterprise value is just 6.6 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.These multiples are very low, meaning the market is factoring in little to no growth going forward. If Seagate can manage to clear what amounts to a very low hurdle, the stock could enjoy a significant snap-back.Plus, investors will receive a very high 4.5% dividend going forward. This compensates investors for waiting for a potential turnaround. Seagate's dividend is a rare find in the market these days, especially for a technology company. Close competitor Western Digital only offers a 2.5% dividend. In fact, Seagate's dividend yield is very close to a five-year high.STX DIVIDEND YIELD (TTM), DATA BY YCHARTS.Seagate's dividend looks well-cushioned with underlying free cash flow, which is a great sign. The company generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow during the first three quarters of its current fiscal year. The dividend cost $493 million in this period, which equates to a very manageable 26% free cash flow payout ratio.If the macroeconomic conditions in the PC industry continue to deteriorate, it will be difficult for Seagate stock to do well. But any improvement in PC shipments during the back half of 2015 could make Seagate a winning investment based on how cheap it is right now. And investors at least have the dividend, which appears secure.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Better Buy Now: Western Digital Corp. or Seagate Technology PLC?,"Nov 10, 2015 at 11:20AM","Times have been tough for Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), the two largest manufacturers of hard disk drives (HDDs) in the world. Shares of both stocks have fallen around 40% since the beginning of the year.That's because the HDD market is being cannibalized on the consumer end by flash-memory solid state drives (SSDs), which run faster, use less power, don't have damage-prone platters, and fit better in thin notebooks and tablets. Yet times are also tough in the SSD market due to the arrival of 3D NAND technology, which could cause SSD and HDD prices to reach price parity as early as next year.IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.To survive in this rapidly shifting market, Western Digital and Seagate have both tried to diversify beyond HDDs. Let's take a closer look at their strategies, growth potential, and valuations to decide which stock is a better buy today.The data-storage arms raceAt the end of last year, Western Digital controlled 43% of the HDD market, Seagate controlled 41%, while Toshiba accounted for the rest. Between the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2014, global HDD shipments fell 16% from 167.5 million to 141 million, according to Storage Newsletter and Trend Focus. However, that decline was slightly offset by robust demand for cheap storage in cloud data centers.To increase its market share in SSDs, Western Digital bought Hitachi's hard drive business, SSD manufacturer STEC, enterprise flash storage company Virident Systems, storage optimization software developer VeloBit, and flash storage array maker Skyera. In October, it agreed to buy flash storage giant SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) for $19 billion. According to Kitguru's market share numbers, Western Digital now controls nearly 14% of the SSD market, making it the second largest player after Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), which controls 45%.Seagate, which made more acquisitions than Western Digital to expand its HDD portfolio over the years, hasn't made as much progress in SSDs. Its only meaningful defense against Western Digital's shopping spree is a multiyear NAND supply alliance with Micron Technology, which controls about 10% of the SSD market.Western Digital has better growthLast quarter, Seagate's revenue fell 22.5% annually to $2.93 billion and missed estimates by $10 million. Enterprise, desktop, and notebook storage shipments all declined across the board, and margins slid from 28.1% a year ago to 24.2%.Western Digital's revenue fell 14.7% annually to $3.36 billion in its most recent quarter, as gross margin declined from 30.1% to 28.9%. However, two-thirds of Western Digital's revenue came from non-PC markets, up from 55% a year earlier. Western Digital's enterprise SSD revenue climbed nearly 50% annually. Those numbers will likely rise even higher after the SanDisk deal closes. For the current quarter, Seagate expects revenue to fall 19% to 22% annually. Western Digital expects revenue to fall 13% to 15% annually during that period. Based on these numbers, Western Digital looks like a more solid investment than Seagate.But Seagate also has fundamental strengthsYet Seagate still has three distinct strengths -- valuation, buybacks, and dividends. Seagate trades at just 9 times earnings, which is significantly lower than Western Digital's P/E of 12 and the industry average of 20 for the data storage industry.Over the past 12 months, Seagate spent 86% of its free cash flow (FCF) on stock buybacks. Western Digital, which spent 47% of its FCF on buybacks during that period, suspended its buyback program due to its acquisition of SanDisk. While a suspended buyback program isn't a huge deal, it indicates that SanDisk's multiples will slightly decline as it reduces the number of outstanding shares, making Western Digital shares look even pricier.Seagate pays a forward annual dividend yield of 4.2%, compared to Western Digital's yield of 2.4%. Seagate has raised its dividend for four consecutive years, versus just two straight years for Western Digital. Western Digital has stated that it will keep paying its dividend, but future payout increases could be affected by the SanDisk acquisition.The verdictWestern Digital and Seagate both face big near-term challenges, but I believe that the former is better positioned for long-term growth. Its acquisition of SanDisk, while costly, will help it pivot more smoothly into the SSD market, while synergies and expanded manufacturing capabilities will let it produce more storage devices at lower prices. Seagate is a fundamentally cheaper stock with bigger buybacks and dividends, but it will likely struggle to gain ground against Western Digital in both HDDs and SSDs.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Why Seagate Technology PLC Fell 12.8% in September,"Oct 6, 2015 at 10:50AM","STX DATA BY YCHARTSWhat: Shares of hard-drive builder Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) fell 12.8% in September, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. It was a multi-stage decline, setting fresh two-year lows along the way.So what: First, an analyst research note painted a dark picture for the future of spinning magnetic disks, pushing Seagate shares 4% lower. Then the stock fell another 6% mid-month on no particular news. Layered on top of a generally wobbly market, these events drove Seagate stock as much as 18% lower. A quick bounce at the tail end of September, powered by archrival Western Digital's receiving a large equity investment from China, could only erase about one-third of the damage done earlier in the month.PHOTO: SEAGATE.Now what: Analyst firm UBS Warburg, whose analysis sparked that initial slide, holds a ""sell"" rating on both STX and WDC as their bread-and-butter bulk storage markets move into the hands of flash-based solid-state storage devices. The price gap that has kept magnetic disks competitive so far is eroding, and enterprise customers have started to prefer the dramatically higher performance of SSD storage over the diminishing cost savings in Seagate's and Western Digital's hard drive portfolios.UBS expects PC sales to fall 8% in calendar year 2015 and another 2% in 2016. Paired with the never-ending drop in street prices per terabyte of storage, that pessimistic forecast spells trouble for Seagate and its only remaining hard-drive rival.UBS's estimates are tough but not unreasonable. Flash devices and other -- even faster, but way more expensive -- technologies really do threaten the end of the magnetic disk era as we know it. Seagate had better adapt to the new high-speed markets or die trying.That being said, Seagate's shares already trade at a rock-bottom 8.5 times trailing earnings. The company generated $1 billion of free cash flows over the last four quarters, and the balance sheet's $4.2 billion in total debt is matched by $2.5 billion of cash equivalents. In other words, Seagate won't stand at death's door until the bottom truly falls out of its end markets. That hasn't happened yet, but the stock is priced for total disaster.So this stock stands at a crossroads today. If the UBS analysis turns out to be absolutely correct, then Seagate deserves to trade at these bargain-bin prices. If not, you should expect that compressed P/E multiple to expand and unlock tremendous value in shares bought today.I think the death of the magnetic hard drive will take a bit longer and give Seagate some time to reinvent itself. Still a gamble, but a tempting one at these ultra-low prices.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Did Avago Technologies Ltd. Ditch Solid-State Drives But Stick With Hard-Disk Drives?,"Jun 28, 2015 at 5:50PM","In late 2013, Avago Technologies (NASDAQ:AVGO) announced it planned to acquire LSI Corp. for a whopping $6.6 billion. LSI designed, among other things, controllers for hard-disk drives and solid-state drives (via its acquisition of SandForce).About six months later, though, Avago sold LSI's accelerated solutions and flash components divisions to hard-disk drive giant Seagate (NASDAQ:STX). This, according to AnandTech, meant that Avago jettisoned LSI's flash accelerator business and its solid-state drive controller business.Given that hard-disk drives are generally considered ""older"" technology in the world of storage, and solid-state drives represent the ""new"" and ""exciting"" technology, it might initially seem Avago got it backward.But it didn't. Here's why.The solid-state drive market is fiercely competitive; not so much with hard-disk drivesThe hard-disk drive industry has three major players: Seagate, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and, to a lesser extent, Toshiba. Supplying these three players with controllers for those drives are Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Avago (via its purchase of LSI).The market for hard-disk drives might not be booming -- according to Yahoo! Finance, both Seagate and Western Digital are expected to register modest revenue declines in the coming fiscal year -- but it's large and relatively stable. And, for drive vendors and controller vendors alike, there's not much competition.This is in sharp contrast to the solid-state drive market.In solid-state drives, a number of vendors manufacture NAND flash, including the Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) joint venture, the Toshiba and SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) joint venture, Samsung Electronics, and Hynix.All of these companies develop and market solid-state drives, and they also sell NAND flash to companies that then build their own solid-state drives. Four of the six vendors above (Intel, Samsung, Toshiba, and Hynix) develop their own solid-state drive controllers. Micron and SanDisk generally source controllers from the merchant vendors.This vertical integration isn't the only factor that makes the merchant solid-state drive controller market so tough. Several merchant vendors, including JMicron, Marvell, and Silicon Motion (NASDAQ:SIMO), are all vying for the noncaptive solid-state drive controller business.Finally, speaking of ""captive demand,"" Apple's new MacBook came packed with an Apple-designed flash controller (widely believed to be the product of its 2012 acquisition of Anobit). I suspect Apple's plan is to transition completely to in-house flash controllers, further narrowing the proportion of the market a merchant controller vendor can ultimately target.Avago seemingly made the right choiceI would say Avago ultimately made the right choice to jettison the LSI SandForce business. Competition within the merchant market for flash/solid-state drive controllers is fierce, and the opportunities for merchant controller vendors as a proportion of the total solid-state drive market don't seem to be getting any larger. The hard-disk drive controller business is much more attractive."
2 Stocks to Watch in Components: Qualcomm and Seagate,"Jul 2, 2015 at 3:02PM","The components space is one of the more intriguing ones within the tech industry. Some companies can be wildly profitable, more successful than the companies that make the devices their components power. Others, not so much -- a break with a favored client or the emergence of a rival technology can devastate their business.Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) are two of the more interesting components stocks in the market today. It's not clear that they're great investments, but both definitely deserve to be on investors' watchlists.Qualcomm has underperformed even as mobile continues to surgeQualcomm components can be found in virtually every smartphone and many tablets sold globally. Qualcomm provides cellular basebands to Apple and many Android OEMs, as well as the Snapdragon mobile processors that power many Android devices.Yet, despite the growth in the mobile market -- smartphone shipments rose more than 27% last year and are expected to grow another 11.3% in 2015, according to research company IDC -- Qualcomm has been a lousy stock to own. Over the last two years, Qualcomm stock has risen just 2.81%, while the broader S&P 500 has rallied more than 25%.^SPX DATA BY YCHARTS.Qualcomm has struggled to collect license royalites on handsets made by Chinese vendors; more recently, Samsung -- which has long been among Qualcomm's largest customers -- has begun to move away. Its latest flagship phone, the Galaxy S6, uses its own processor rather than relying on Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon.However, Qualcomm remains a fixture in the mobile industry, and its valuation makes it an interesting stock. Based on its earnings multiple, Qualcomm is near a five-year low: It's currently trading at less than 15 times earnings (both trailing and forward), and it yields near 3%. That makes it somewhat of a bargain given the growth in its industry. Further upside could come if other vendors that use its products (like China's Xiaomi) take a larger share of the market, or if it can win Samsung back.Seagate offers an attractive yield, but its core market appears to be in declineSeagate has little exposure to mobile devices. Instead, its business is tied to traditional PC and servers. Seagate is one of only three remaining hard drive manufacturers, with around 40% market share.Given the ongoing decline in the market for PCs -- research company Gartner reported that worldwide PC shipments declined 5.2% last year -- it's not particularly surprising that Seagate has been an underperformer. Seagate shares have fallen more than 15% over the last 12 months, as the S&P 500 has rallied almost 5%. STX DATA BY YCHARTS.Seagate's recent earnings reports have been disappointing, with soft sales and lower-than-expected guidance. Seagate's management has resorted to citing broader macro economic trends -- in January, Seagate's CEO blamed the European economy -- but there's no doubt Seagate's business is being challenged by a technological shift. A growing number of PCs are shipping with solid-state drives rather than hard drives, and even higher-capacity servers are turning toward solid state. Intel expects solid-state drives to reach 50% penetration by 2018. Seagate offers solid-state drives, but is a relative non-player in the industry: According to research company IHS, it had just 1% market share last year.What makes Seagate interesting is that it's both absurdly cheap and high-yielding. Seagate currently yields around 4.30%, which is exceedingly rare among tech stocks, and it trades with a single-digit trailing price-to-earnings ratio. If the demand for traditional PCs bounces back, or solid-state adoption takes longer than anticipated, Seagate could reward shareholders."
Dot Hill Systems Corp. Soars on Acquisition by Seagate,"Aug 19, 2015 at 12:05PM","What: Shares of storage system vendor Dot Hill Systems (NASDAQ:HILL) soared on Wednesday after the company announced that Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) was acquiring the company for $9.75 per share. By 11 a.m. Wednesday, Dot Hill stock had risen by about 87%, to a few cents shy of Seagate's offer price.So what: Seagate, one of two major players in the hard drive market, will pay about $694 million for Dot Hill, a manufacturer of external storage arrays. This $9.75-per-share price represents an 88% premium to Dot Hill's Tuesday closing price, and a 50% premium to Dot Hill's three-month average stock price. Seagate expects the deal to close during the fourth quarter of this year, and for the transaction to add to its non-GAAP earnings in fiscal 2016.Seagate has been diversifying its business through acquisitions, and Dot Hill is the third major deal struck by Seagate over the past two years. In 2014, Seagate paid $374 million for Xyratex, a seller of enterprise data storage systems, in addition to buying LSI's flash business for $450 million. Seagate's stock was down slightly on Wednesday's news.Phil Brace, president of cloud systems and electronics solutions at Seagate, pointed out the benefits of the acquisition: ""Dot Hill's innovative storage systems and IP portfolio are a strategic addition to our storage technology portfolio, enabling us to accelerate the growth of Seagate's OEM-focused cloud storage system and solutions business. We are focused on providing the highest quality storage systems for our OEM customers and Dot Hill's storage solutions will enable us to advance our strategic efforts.""Now what: Seagate is transitioning away from simply being a seller of hard drives to being a seller of storage solutions, and the Dot Hill acquisition makes strategic sense. The price Seagate is paying is high, nearly three times trailing-12-month sales and about 50 times TTM net income, but Dot Hill's technology should give Seagate's storage solutions business a boost.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here's Why Micron Technology Is Paying $3.5 Billion For a Longtime Partner,"Dec 15, 2015 at 1:30PM","IMAGE SOURCE: INOTERA.On Monday morning, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) announced that it is buying 67% of Taiwanese memory chip producer Inotera Memories in a $3.2 billion deal.The agreement puts a $0.92 price on each Inotera share, traded on the Taiwanese stock exchange. The sale should close in the middle of 2016, assuming that the usual regulatory proceedings work out as planned. Inotera and Micron are still hammering out the final details of the contract, and should have a final version ready in approximately 60 days.Micron is financing the buyout with a combination of existing cash, $2.5 billion of new debt, and $1 billion of Micron shares. Although Inotera is a publicly owned company, sector rival Nanya Technology's parent company owns nearly half of what Micron is buying here. Nanya has agreed to vote in favor of the sale in return for that $1 billion block of Micron shares.What's the big deal?Quite frankly, Micron could live without this buyout. It's a positive move, but investors will actually hardly notice the difference in the long run.Micron already buys and redistributes 100% of Inotera's chip production, which represents roughly 35% of Micron's total manufacturing volume. This deal simply puts a couple of close business partners even closer together. Kind of like a large company that's leasing some of its business assets, and now wants to own them instead.It's not really a game-changing strategy overhaul, but more of an efficiency play. Micron's production workflow will simplify when the Inotera deal closes, as will the company's accounting.Micron has experience with big-ticket buyouts, where failure just wasn't an option. The often uncertain Elpida deal created economies of scale that were absolutely necessary for survival. But that's not what we're looking at here.If Taiwanese regulators or Inotera shareholders trip up this deal, clocks will not stop in Micron's Boise, Ida., headquarters. Getting this done would be a useful administrative move, but the beat goes on anyhow.MICRON'S BOISE HEADQUARTERS. IMAGE SOURCE: MICRON.Throwing wrenches in the works?That being said, having this billion-dollar deal on the stove -- complete with new debt financing -- probably kept Micron from entering a bidding war over SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) this summer. Hard drive veteran Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) ended up paying $19 billion for the flash-memory device specialist, and it is quite possibly that Micron drove the price up.But instead of reaching for a truly massive SanDisk deal, Micron decided to double down on business efficiency and wait for Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) to come looking for a deep and long-term supply contract. It won't be quite the growth play that a straight-up SanDisk buyout could have been, but this option also saves Micron billions of deal dollars while digging a hole in rival Western Digital's pocket. Smart thinking, I say.The storage industry has boiled down to a handful of muscular players, much like the memory sector before it -- and thanks to the rise of solid-state storage, the two industries are inching ever closer together.The Inotera buyout is not even a real factor in these trends. It's just a minor tweak to Micron's operational efficiency."
The 2 Best Stocks To Invest In Data Storage,"Aug 11, 2015 at 1:00PM","Investing in the data storage market can be tricky, and requires an understanding of the growing rift between platter-based hard drives (HDDs) and new solid state drives (SSDs).SOURCE: PIXABAY.HDDs were once standard in the PC market, but market growth has slowed over the past four years due to the rise of tablets and ultrabooks, which require smaller SSDs for thinner frames. Worldwide HDD shipments fell annually between 2011 and 2013, but recovered 2.2% in 2014, as growth in the cloud/enterprise market offset losses in laptops and tablets.The SSD market is much smaller than the HDD one, but it's growing rapidly. Back in 2012, over 15 times as many HDDs were shipped worldwide as SSDs. Last year, HDD shipments were only about five times higher. SSD makers, looking for growth beyond the slowing tablet market, are now looking toward the enterprise market. However, HDDs still have a price advantage in that market, since they still cost about half the price of an SSD with the same storage capacity.Now that we understand those trends, let's discuss two of the top ""pure play"" stocks in HDDs and SSDs -- Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK).Western DigitalWestern Digital controlled 44% of the HDD market last year, compared to 41% for Seagate and 16% for Toshiba. HDDs generate the majority of Western Digital's revenue. According to research firm Gartner, SSD sales only accounted for $500 million, or 3%, of Western Digital's 2013 sales. Due to ongoing concerns about SSDs displacing traditional HDDs, shares of both WD and Seagate have fallen 26% since the beginning of the year.However, Western Digital has beefed up its SSD portfolio with several acquisitions, including SSD manufacturer sTec, enterprise flash storage company Virident Systems, and storage optimization software developer Velobit. It also acquired flash storage array maker Skyera last December. Thanks to those investments, Western Digital's enterprise SSD (data center) revenues more than doubled annually to $244 million last quarter, indicating that the business could soon generate over $1 billion in annual revenues.Western Digital is still strongly dependent on the PC market, which experienced a 9.5% annual decline in the second quarter, according to Gartner. During Western Digital's fourth quarter earnings (reported at the end of July), revenues fell nearly 13% annually to $3.19 billion, missing the company's own prior guidance for $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Adjusted non-GAAP EPS declined 24% to $1.51, but topped estimates by five cents.Those numbers looked weak, but analysts were optimistic regarding WD's eventual integration of Hitachi's hard drive business. WD purchased the unit two years ago, but the full integration of manufacturing and supply operations has been delayed by MOFCOM (the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China) due to antitrust concerns. Brean Capital analyst Amanda Baruah, who has a $150 target price on the stock, expects an approval to contribute $60 to WD's stock price.SandiskSandisk is the third largest manufacturer of flash memory in the world after Samsung and Toshiba. But unlike those massive companies, Sandisk is a ""pure play"" on the flash storage and SSD market.Sandisk's SSD business is its fastest growing division. The unit's annual revenues soared from $440 million in 2012 to $1.9 billion in 2014. The unit's contribution to Sandisk's top line soared from 3% in 2011 to 29% in 2014. However, that percentage is expected to remain the same this year, due to the loss of a ""major customer"" in the client SSD (notebooks, tablets, smartphones) market in January -- widely believed to be Apple, its top customer.Sandisk also continues to faces intense competition from market giants like Samsung, expanding HDD makers like Western Digital, and flash memory rivals like Micron. All that pressure caused Sandisk to lower its revenue guidance for fiscal 2015, causing its stock to plunge 40% since the beginning of the year.However, Sandisk bounced back slightly in late July after it beat analyst estimates on both revenue and earnings with lower-than-expected declines for its second quarter. Looking ahead, Sandisk expects its acquisition of SSD maker Fusion-io, which closed last June, to strengthen its enterprise SSD portfolio and become earnings accretive this year. That growth could offset its declines in the client SSD market.A contrarian viewThe market clearly doesn't love Western Digital and Sandisk due to ongoing concerns about disruption and competition. However, both companies are rolling with the punches -- WD is expanding its SSD portfolio, and Sandisk is using enterprise SSDs to offset losses in client SSDs.WD is also fairly cheap, at 13 times earnings, compared to the industry average of 19 for data storage devices. Sandisk has a higher P/E of 23, but that's significantly lower than its P/E of 32.5 from early 2013. Both stocks could recover in the future, but investors should do their homework and fully understand the data storage market before buying any shares."
3 Things Western Digital Corp. Management Wants You to Know,"Dec 10, 2015 at 2:30PM","The CEO of hard disk maker Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Steve Milligan, presented at the recent Nasdaq Investor Program in London. During the presentation (which consisted of prepared remarks followed by a question-and-answer session), Milligan offered quite a lot of insight into the company's business today as well as its longer-term prospects.In this article, I'd like to highlight three items from the presentation that stood out to me as I research the company as a potential investment opportunity.Despite storage growth, industry profits are shrinking; what might reverse this?Katy Huberty, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, observed that over the past several quarters, total hard disk drive industry profits have shrunk despite continued growth in total shipped hard disk drive capacity and a very consolidated market (there are only two major players in the hard disk drive market -- Western Digital and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) -- with Toshiba a distant third in terms of market share).Huberty asked Milligan about his views on what will drive a change from the current situation and ultimately allow the hard disk drive industry to perform better.Milligan noted that the PC market has performed worse than the company had expected heading into the year, which affected both total industry profits as well as Western Digital's own profitability (it's worth noting that competitor Seagate has also been affected and its stock price is down slightly more year to date than Western Digital's is).The hard disk drive maker's CEO says the company is optimistic that the decline in the PC market ""might begin to abate a bit,"" which he thinks could ""enable a more stable environment from not only a revenue perspective, but also from a profit perspective.""A Western Digital-specific tailwindIn addition to the hard disk drive industry potentially getting healthier should PCs stabilize, Milligan also highlighted another factor that could significantly improve Western Digital's profitability: a recent ruling from the Ministry of Commerce of the Government of the People's Republic of China, or MOFCOM.By way of background, Western Digital acquired rival hard disk maker Hitachi Global Storage Technologies back in 2012. In order for this deal to pass MOFCOM scrutiny, Western Digital had to agree to essentially run Hitachi Global Storage Solutions as an ""independent competitor in the global hard disk drive market.""In complying with these terms, Western Digital has had to deal with substantial duplication of resources (research and development, sales and marketing, and so on), impacting the company's financial efficiency and ultimately profitability. Recently, however, MOFCOM agreed to allow Western Digital to begin to more tightly integrate the Western Digital and Hitachi Global Storage operations. According to Milligan, the only real ""separation"" that needs to happen now following the latest MOFCOM ruling is that Western Digital and Hitachi Global Storage need to have two separate sales forces.All told, the savings that Western Digital expects to realize, per Milligan, on the operating expense side of things works out to $400 million annually that the company expects ""to fully fall to the bottom line.""Milligan also says there will be savings that manifest themselves in terms of gross profit margin, but the magnitude of the cost reduction has yet to be publicly quantified.""We intend to quantify that sometime in the first part of 2016 as to what those savings will look like,"" Milligan stated.Comments on the SanDisk acquisitionWestern Digital recently announced it would be acquiring flash memory specialist SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) in a bid to bolster its efforts in solid state drives.Milligan said Western Digital had been ""thinking about"" either acquiring or investing in SanDisk for a number of years.""It was not a reaction to any short-term changes in the market that we've been seeing,"" the executive clarified.So, why exactly did the company buy SanDisk? Milligan outlined three big-picture reasons.""It allows us to have the broadest product portfolio in the industry bar none,"" he said. Western Digital is already a leading vendor of hard disk drives, and with SanDisk under the company's belt it will also be a major vendor of flash-based solutions into both consumer markets as well as enterprise applications.Milligan also argued that by owning SanDisk, Western Digital will ""have access"" to flash-based technology (which is known to have a number of significant advantages relative to standard mechanical hard disk drives) both today and going forward.""The reason why having access to that technology is that we will be able to tune those flash-based solutions or hard-drive based solutions in a way that are [sic] most optimized for these changing customer needs,"" he said.Finally, Milligan believes this deal should offer a ""very compelling, long-term financial return"" for both Western Digital and its stockholders."
Dividend Investing: It's Hard to Beat,"Sep 15, 2015 at 8:06AM","It's easy to ignore dividends when investing in the stock market, as quarterly payments of, say, $0.31 or $0.57 don't seem like anything to get excited about. That's wrong-headed thinking, though, because dividends are surprisingly effective wealth builders and can even be exciting. Imagine, for example, investing in a growing company and getting 5% of your investment back every year -- while your stock grows in value, too. That's a sweet deal.Let's review some of the many reasons why dividend investing is hard to beat.Dividends tend to be paid by companies that are more stable and less volatile than othersPaying a dividend to shareholders is a commitment that companies don't take lightly, and management will avoid having to reduce or eliminate that payout. Dividends are generally instituted when management is confident that the company will be able to keep paying (and, ideally, increasing) its dividend, due to fairly predictable earnings. Dividend investing can keep you focused on relatively reliable companies.Dividends, when reinvested, account for much of the growth of the stock marketAccording to Forbes magazine, ""... the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 10,800 on December 31, 2004 and 17,800 on December 31, 2014 for a 10-year price advance of 7,000 points, or 65%, but when dividends are included, the index gained 114% on a total return basis."" Data from Morningstar's Ibbotson Associates show that between 1927 and the end of 2012, reinvested dividend income made up 42% of large-cap stock returns, 36% of mid-cap stock returns and 31% of small-cap stock returns.DIVIDENDS ARE A POWERFUL WAY TO GROW YOUR WEALTH.Dividend-paying stocks tend to outperform non-dividend-paying stocksJohn Buckingham of AFAM Capital has cited a study of Russell 3000 companies dating back to 1992 that found dividend payers returned about four percentage points more per year, on average, than non-payers, when weighted equally. Researchers Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, studying data from 1927-2014, found dividend payers outperforming non-payers, averaging 10.4% annually vs. 8.5%.Dividends grow. It's great to collect, say, a 3% yield on your investment each year – on top of stock-price appreciation. But better still is this: dividends from healthy, growing companies tend to get hiked over time – often annually. Check out the annual payout  from Lowe's, for example:YearAnnual dividend per share2005$0.102007$0.262009$0.352011$0.502013$0.682015$1.02Growing dividends increase your effective yield, too. For example, imagine that you spend $1,000 on a stock that pays you $30 annually in dividends, for a 3% yield. If it increases that payout by, say, 7% annually, it will be paying you about $59 in a decade. Income of $59 on a $1,000 investment translates to a yield of 5.9%, about twice what you started with. Twenty years after you bought that stock, it might be paying you $163 annually, which reflects an effective yield on your original investment of 16.3%!DIVIDENDS MAY SEEM LIKE SMALL CHANGE, BUT THEY CAN ADD UP OVER TIME AND MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE TO YOUR BOTTOM LINE.Dividend income can easily top interest rates offered by banks and CDs -- especially these daysThe national average interest rate for five-year CDs was recently 0.87%, with one-year CDs offering just a third of that, 0.28%. Money market accounts and savings accounts at banks averaged 0.47%. Meanwhile, According to our CAPS stock screener, there were recently 188 stocks with market capitalizations of $10 billion or more and dividend yields of 3% or more. Restrict the list to just those with ratings of four or five stars (out of five), and you still get more than 100. Dividend investing doesn't restrict you very much.Dividends are not limited to slow-growing companiesYou might not realize it, but plenty of technology-heavy companies with rapid growth potential are paying dividends these days -- and increasing them over time, too. Below are just a few examples of tech companies in the dividend investing universe:CompanyRecent YieldApple 1.9%Cisco Systems 3.3%IBM 3.6%Intel 3.4%Microsoft 2.9%Qualcomm 3.5%Seagate Technology 4.5%Verizon 4.9%Never invest in a stock solely because it offers a dividend. Some low-quality companies pay dividends, and some dividends -- of good companies and bad -- get reduced or eliminated during tough times. But do consider a dividend a plus when evaluating a company. And know that keeping at least a portion of your portfolio in healthy, growing dividend payers is a smart move, likely to enhance your portfolio's performance. It's not hard to do, either. Even the S&P 500-based SPDR S&P 500 ETF was recently yielding about 2%.The $16,122 Social Security bonus you could be missingIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

Did Western Digital Corp. Overpay for SanDisk Corporation?,"Oct 28, 2015 at 7:37AM","Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) recently agreed to acquire SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) for $19 billion, or $86.50 per share. WD controlled 43% of the market for traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) last year. However, WD only has a small market share in solid-state drives (SSDs), which are smaller, faster, and don't have damage-prone moving parts. Despite their higher cost, SSDs have displaced HDDs in higher-end tablets and PCs over the past few years.IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.That's why WD bought SanDisk, which controls 11% of the SSD market. Combined with Hitachi's hard drive unit, which it acquired three years ago, WD will control nearly 14% of the SSD market. That makes it the second largest SSD manufacturer in the world after Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), which controls nearly 45% of the market. While the logic behind the deal is sound, some WD investors might be wondering if the company overpaid.The key numbersWestern Digital's proposed $86.50 purchase price will consist of $85.10 in cash and the rest in stock. But if a planned 15% investment in WD by Tsinghua Unigroup subsidiary Unisplendour goes through, the cash portion of the deal will drop to $67.50 per share.Western Digital finished last quarter with just $5.3 billion in cash and $2.6 billion in debt. To finance the deal, WD plans to take on $18.4 billion in new debt. It will also suspend its buyback program, which was used to buy back $758 million in shares over the past 12 months. However, WD will keep paying dividends, which took $396 million out of its free cash flow of $1.6 billion over the past 12 months.Western Digital expects cost synergies to reach a $500 million per year run rate within 18 months. The company expects the deal to become earnings accretive within 12 months after closing.Do two losers make a winner?By buying SanDisk's portfolio of NAND chips, controllers, and SSDs, WD has greatly reduced the threat of SSDs disrupting its core HDD business. But SanDisk also struggled over the past year due to lower prices, product delays, and a loss of top customers like Apple and Samsung. Apple previously accounted for nearly a fifth of SanDisk's business, according to Bloomberg estimates.As a result, analysts expect SanDisk's revenue to tumble 17% annually this year, to $5.5 billion, and earnings per share to plunge 43%. By comparison, Western Digital is expected to post a 7.4% decline in sales to $13.5 billion with an earnings drop of 13%.Buying SanDisk gives WD a strong presence in SSDs and flash memory, but it also inherits the company's problems. Samsung could keep stealing business away, while a projected NAND oversupply could keep driving down prices. Earlier this year, SanDisk admitted prices were declining faster than costs, and that it remained behind the technological curve in next-gen 3D NAND technology. While SanDisk's SSD sales rose 60% annually to $1.9 billion last year, or 29% of its revenue, sales of embedded and removable storage both declined.Did Western Digital pay too much?WD's offer of $86.50 per share values SanDisk at nearly 35 times trailing earnings, compared to the industry average P/E of 15 for the data storage industry. Therefore, investors might be wondering why WD didn't wait for SanDisk's price to drop further.There are three explanations for WD's timing. First, it wanted to take on $18.4 billion in debt when interest rates were low. A potential hike later this year could cost WD hundreds of millions in extra interest payments. Second, SanDisk shares have been rebounding since September, thanks to several analyst upgrades that championed SanDisk's growth potential in the enterprise SSD market. Lastly, SanDisk's $1.1 billion acquisition of Fusion-io just started to become earnings accretive. If Western Digital waited longer, it could end up paying higher interest rates on an even higher total price tag.How this fits into everything elseBy merging its manufacturing operations with SanDisk, WD can take advantage of economies of scale and manufacture more SSDs and memory chips at lower prices. This would help it compete more effectively against Samsung. This strategy also complements WD's acquisition of Hitachi GST, which boosted its HDD market share against industry rival Seagate (NASDAQ:STX).It might take a while for Western Digital to fully integrate SanDisk's business, but after that integration concludes, Seagate could be in trouble. Seagate bought Samsung's HDD unit four years ago to counter WD's purchase of HGST, but its only defense against WD's acquisition of SanDisk is a multi-year NAND supply alliance with Micron.The key takeawayWD needed to buy SanDisk to boost its lead over Seagate and improve the balance between SSDs and HDDs in its portfolio. The price tag might seem high, but considering the favorable interest rate environment and SanDisk's potential rebound, I believe Western Digital made the right move."
3 Things SanDisk Corporation's Management Wants You to Know,"Nov 18, 2015 at 3:00PM","Public companies almost always follow up on their quarterly reports with some kind of conference call. Most of the time, it's a plain old phone conference with management and analysts. Other times, it's a live video stream with a tightly controlled management interview, or even a no-holds-barred flow of questions from common investors, submitted over social media. Either way, there will almost always be more color in these calls than a regular earnings release can provide.SOURCE: WESTERN DIGITAL.But when SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) recently reported third-quarter earnings, the follow-up was very different. Right alongside the expected report, SanDisk also announced that hard-drive veteran Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is buying the company in a blockbuster $19 billion deal.So there was a change of plans. ""SanDisk will not host a third quarter 2015 earnings conference call, previously scheduled for today,"" said the earnings release. That call was replaced by a merger call -- but don't confuse that for an opportunity to talk about SanDisk's freshest business results.""Please note that today's conference call, including the Q&A portion of the call, will focus exclusively on the transaction announced today,"" said Bob Blair, Western Digital's VP of investor relations. By and large, that order was followed.Accordingly, there will be no discussion of SanDisk's third quarter here. For the record, the Flash-memory expert beat Wall Street's estimates across the board thanks to a highly profitable product mix.But that won't stop SanDisk's management from getting the last word. So let's hear how the two companies are planning their big-ticket merger.1. Data growthBetween 2013 and 2020, we are expecting to see about 10x growth in data. Data is becoming more strategic, both for enterprises and end users. Workloads are increasingly transitioning to Big Data-centric analysis, requiring massive amounts of storage and computing power.The accelerating trend of mobility and consumerization of IT is allowing us to establish direct relationships with data users. Businesses' desire to have more efficient and agile infrastructures is driving architectural transformation in the data center.This transaction allows us to fully participate, influence, and shape each of these trends.-- Steve Milligan, Western Digital CEOThis is why Western Digital and fellow hard-drive specialist Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) will remain valuable for years to come, even without a solid-state strategy in place. Magnetic platters still provide massive economies of scale, and we're a long way away from SSD storage matching the cost per byte of magnetic storage.That being said, Western Digital is smart to pick up an established leader in the SSD space, and I'm curious as to why Seagate isn't following suit. It's true that the Flash-memory space isn't exactly littered with handy buyout candidates anymore, but Seagate could climb down the supply chain to pick up a components specialist or two, then hammer out a solid-state strategy around that acquired expertise.Instead, Western Digital is not only merging with a premium-grade SSD builder, but also outspending Seagate in the research department. And after this buyout closes, the combined SanDisk/WD beast will sport an R&D budget nearly twice the size of Seagate's. With or without the SanDisk deal, the bulk storage market's balance of power is shifting. This deal only accelerates the existing trend.SANDISK CEO SANJAY MEROTHRA. PHOTO: SANDISK.2. Unmatched knowledgeThe storage industry is evolving rapidly, and customers are looking for partners that understand data-center requirements and the technologies shaping them. Innovative partners with deep technological capabilities, scale, and ecosystem relationships are becoming increasingly critical to our customers.Both SanDisk and Western Digital have a shared heritage of innovation, and our combined technical expertise will be unmatched in the industry.-- Sanjay Mehrothra, SanDisk CEOMehrotra really hits the nail right on the head here. If there's a secret sauce in this business combination, it's in the pairing of Western Digital's bulk-storage expertise with SanDisk's consumer and high-performance chops.Seagate certainly can't match this deadly combination, as explained above. And beyond that, there are really only three hard-drive makers left in this ultra-consolidated market. Toshiba offers both SSD and hard-drive products, but holds a vanishingly small market share in both cases, and has bigger fish to fry in the consumer-electronics space.SanDisk plus Western Digital will be a unique business, and we don't even have a historical precedent for this chimera. I can't wait to see the products this company will cook up -- or how Seagate plans to fight back.3. SanDisk's world didn't stop on a dimeWe have said that, in the initial transition to 3D, the capital intensity will go up for SanDisk. But it will remain, we believe, within the target financial model that we've defined for the CapEx, which is 20% to 30% of our revenue.And so we have planned this over time. We will begin ramping our 3D in 2016 in their new Fab 2 that was just announced last night.-- Judy Bruner, SanDisk CFOThe merger talk doesn't stop SanDisk from conducting business as usual in the meantime. Bruner's comment here is a great example of that fact.The company is ramping up a new technology platform for higher-density Flash-memory storage. This is an essential step toward making these solutions more affordable, so SanDisk is putting its back into the effort with a major capital investment.But the factory upgrades won't push SanDisk out of its capital expense comfort zone, and the Western Digital merger will only increase SanDisk's headroom for long-term planning. In fiscal year 2015, SanDisk spent 32% of its operating cash flows on capital expenditures; Western Digital's ratio was just 27%, and started from a much larger operating cash-flow funnel.It's business as usual for SanDisk -- until it isn't. And I would say that the company is looking forward to an upgraded financial platform.10 stocks we like better than SanDisk CorpWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

6 Stocks That Could Double In 2016,"Nov 14, 2015 at 3:00PM","SOURCE: 401KCALCULATOR.ORG VIA FLICKR.As long as most of your money is invested in high-quality, stable companies, there's absolutely nothing wrong with doing some speculating on companies with massive potential for gains. With that in mind, here are six stocks that our experts feel have a realistic chance to double within the next year.Selena Maranjian: Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL) is one stock that could double in 2016. A key reason for that is that the stock has plunged more than 70% during the past year, dropping enough to now make it look like a bargain, according to some measures. You can't assess its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio because it recently posted a net loss, not net earnings. But its price-to-sales ratio was recently 0.4, well below its five-year average of 5.5 and the S&P 500's average of 2.8. Its price-to-cash-flow ratio was 7.7, well below both its five-year-average and the S&P 500's recent level of 11.6.Numbers aren't everything, though. A look at the big picture will reflect why the stock cratered: The company was whacked by several scandals, leading to much of its top management, including its CEO and CFO, resigning or being replaced. (The scandals featured a powerful 60 Minutes story alleging that the seller of hardwood flooring and other materials had been selling products from China with illegal levels of the carcinogen formaldehyde in it -- and selling some flooring made from illegally harvested wood.)Where is the company now? Well, there is a path to recovery -- though it's far from certain, as the company is still the subject of various investigations. The stock may well fail to double any time soon. Still, it now has a new CEO, is ""developing stronger relationships with suppliers,"" and plans to open more than 20 new stores this year.In its third quarter, revenue dropped 11% year over year due partly to scandal-related weakened demand, and also to ""our suspension of sales of all laminate flooring sourced from China and the disruption of supply during the replacement of certain engineered hardwood vendors, as well as a stronger competitive environment."" Lumber Liquidators' recent price presents a great entry point if you believe in its future.Sean Williams: There's no beating around the bush: 3D printing companies have had a dismal year. However, looking into 2016, investors with a high tolerance for risk looking for a longer-term growth story might be wise to dig into 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD).With its shares down around 90% from their peak, 3D Systems looks like a mess. Fresh off yet another quarterly EPS and revenue shortfall in the third quarter, 3D Systems put the blame on weakened capital investments and reduced demand across the globe. It's also dealt with supply chain issues related to the introduction of new products during the last couple of years.However, there are reasons to believe that 3D Systems could have a much brighter year in 2016. To begin with, the company is seeing growth in its healthcare segment, and it ended the latest quarter with $157.5 million in cash on hand. At the moment, this cash comprises around 15% of the company's valuation, and is acting as extra cushion for the company while it attempts to navigate choppy global demand in non-healthcare industries.3D Systems also has an exceptionally high level of short interest: 33.8 million shares compared to a float of 106.3 million shares. With the company now trading below book value and well capitalized, it wouldn't take much good news -- say a revenue beat in 2016, or an earnings-accretive acquisition -- to create a possible short squeeze.Finally, we're talking about a long-term growth story that, at least on paper, seems to make a lot of sense. 3D printing has the ability to lower long-term business expenses across a variety of industries. If 3D Systems can simply demonstrate sales stabilization in 2016, it's possible the stock could see the $20 level once again.Cheryl Swanson: Targeted cancer treatment biotech Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) has a shot at doubling in 2016, based on the chance it could vastly expand the commercial potential for one of its drugs. Chance is the key word here, because Exelixis is strictly a high-risk/high-reward stock. Still, thanks to a nod from the FDA, the company now has two highly promising drugs on the market.Exelixis' first drug, Cometriq, is already being used to treat a rare form of thyroid cancer. Cometriq hauled in sales of $17.4 million in the first half of 2015. While that's pocket change for a cancer drug, the company is working hard to expand Cometriq's indications. Next up is approval for kidney cancer, and thanks to a near-doubling of progression-free survival in its METEOR study, that approval looks almost in the bag.Kidney cancer is one of the top ten most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the U.S., so an FDA nod would expand the drug's potential from just a few hundred patients a year to a treatable population of 17,000. Cometriq is also being evaluating in liver cancer, with final data expected in 2017.Exelixis has another extremely exciting product in its pipeline -- cobimetrinib. On November 10, the FDA green-lighted the drug as part of a melanoma ""cocktail"" treatment with Roche's (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY) Zelboraf. The cobi/Zelboraf combination has enormous potential to become the standard-of-care therapy for BRAF-mutated melanoma patients. At least one analyst has projected a possible $790 million revenue opportunity just in the U.S., where Exelixis has a 50% profit share. Doubling is a tall order, but this biotech appears to have turned the corner in its clinical pipeline, and the stock is certainly worth monitoring.Matt Frankel: One stock that I think has the potential to double (or more) in the next year is Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Not only is the stock trading at a huge discount -- down more than 46% since April -- but there are several reasons to be optimistic going forward.Twitter's revenue continues to grow impressively, up 64% from the same quarter a year ago. And although it's occurring at a slower rate than in previous years, Twitter's active user base continues to grow. CEO Jack Dorsey is back in control, and seems genuinely committed to getting the company pointed in the right direction.Most importantly, Twitter's management understands what the problem is. With 95% brand recognition in its key markets, but only a 30% penetration rate, Twitter is simply not appealing enough to the masses -- yet. In other words, too many people don't really understand why they should use Twitter. In the company's press release, Dorsey said that the company's three main priorities are ""ensuring more disciplined execution, simplifying our services, and better communicating the value of our platform.""Recently, the company has taken steps to appeal to the masses with newer offerings such as Moments, Vine, and Periscope. The bottom line is that Twitter knows what it hasn't done well, and is investing considerable resources to fix it. If successful, we could see Twitter's user base spike, which would translate to higher revenue and a boost to its stock.Dan Caplinger: It takes a special stock to double in a single year, and often, those stocks also carry big risk. That's certainly true of iron-ore specialist Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE:CLF), which has been struggling with poor conditions in the commodities markets along with the operational challenges of restructuring to focus on its best profit opportunities.Cliffs Natural's stock has plunged in recent years as it pulled back from its presence in Canada, and largely concentrated on its assets in the Great Lakes region. With the goal of supplying steelmakers in the region, Cliffs wants to use its geographical proximity to fend off international competition and sustain premium prices compared to the world market. Efforts to cut costs have had some success, but what could really move the stock price higher would be an unexpected boost in iron-ore demand that would, in turn, drive market prices for the commodity upward.With massive short interest of 40% of the company's share float, many investors are betting against Cliffs Natural, and there's a real risk that shareholders could lose everything if the company's strategy fails. Nevertheless, if Cliffs can pull off a victory, it could squeeze short-sellers and create a huge run-up in the stock to recover some of its lost ground in recent years.Jason Hall: One stock with a great chance of doubling over the next year or so is Chart Industries (NASDAQ:GTLS). If you've followed the company for a few years, you may think I'm crazy, considering the company's stock is down 85% from its peak in late 2013:Chart's core business is cryogenic gas processing for the energy, industrial, and biomedical industries. Huge expectations that global demand for natural gas would lead to big growth for Chart led the company's stock to skyrocket to those levels before steadily declining ever since.This is less of a reaction to the quality of Chart's business, and more a ""normalization"" of the stock price from the market's high expectations, which haven't really panned out. The thing is, the sell-off looks far overdone:Chart's stock price has fallen because the expectations have changed; but we aren't talking about a company on the edge of failure:Not only has the company been consistently profitable, but management has taken steps to lower costs in the current demand environment, setting it up to comfortably ride out the downturn until demand recovers. Once the market catches on, Chart's stock is likely to go way up."
Loral Space & Communications Is a Slow-Motion Train Wreck in Space,"Nov 11, 2015 at 12:16PM","ALL YEAR LONG, LORAL HAS GONE NOWHERE BUT DOWN. DON'T EXPECT THAT TO CHANGE. LORL TOTAL RETURN PRICE DATA BY YCHARTS.For space investors, Loral Space & Communications (NASDAQ:LORL) poses a bit of a conundrum. On the one hand, Loral's not the easiest company to keep track of. The company doesn't issue regular press releases through the ""newswires"" for republication on Yahoo! Finance. And when an earnings report comes out, it can be difficult to locate it even on the company's own website (which instead redirects shareholders to Loral's SEC filings).On the other hand, at $1.4 billion in market capitalization, Loral isn't such a small company that investors can ignore it entirely. It also owns 62.8% of Telesat, one of the world's largest satellite communications providers. So while Loral may not be in quite the same league as space giants like United Launch Alliance, it's not a small fry, either, by any means.And so... hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to the SEC filings we go -- if we want to find out how Loral fared last quarter.The newsLoral filed its most recent 10-Q report with the SEC on Monday, and the stock is up 4.1% since. Lacking an accompanying press release to give ""color"" to the report, we'll be focusing almost entirely on the numbers today. Here's how they look:Revenues for the fiscal third quarter 2015 declined 10.6% in comparison to Q3 2015, to $187.9 million. Revenues year to date are down 12.5% -- so the Q3 numbers were a slight improvement in that regard.Operating expenses fell 20.6% in Q3, and 16% year to date, the implication being that if revenues are falling, at least costs are falling faster. The happy result is that operating profit was essentially flat year over year -- down just 0.6% in Q3 (but 8.6% year to date).The bad news is that Loral has taken it on the chin on foreign exchange rates this year. Forex losses surged in Q3, and they have tripled so far this year compared to last year. The more than $333 million in FX losses booked so far have in fact completely wiped out all operating profits, with the result that on the bottom line, Loral has nothing but losses to show for its efforts this year -- $176.6 million over the past three months, or more than $8.25 per share.Turning to Loral's cash flow statement, the situation looks a little less dire -- but still far from good. According to data from S&P Capital IQ, Loral has been running operating and free cash flow deficits (albeit, declining in size) for the past four years. Year to date, Loral has generated negative operating cash flow of $25.4 million. Minimal capital expenditures bring the free cash flow total to negative $25.5 million.The upshot for investorsLacking color to the news to explain why it might not be as bad as it appears, a conservative investor can only assume that it is as bad as it appears. This company isn't just reporting GAAP losses due to currency exchange rate headwinds (which are variable, and could reverse at any time). It's also burning real, tangible cash -- and has been doing so for four years straight.Long story short, I'd rather be short this stock than long.10 stocks we like better than Loral Space and CommunicationsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Should Intel Corporation Worry About Avago Technologies Ltd.?,"Jun 3, 2015 at 9:08PM","The chipmaking industry was recently shaken up by two massive acquisitions. In late May, Avago Technologies (NASDAQ:AVGO) agreed to acquire Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM) for $37 billion. Avago develops analog and mixed-signal chips for automotive, industrial, and communications purposes, along with custom networking chips. Broadcom develops radios for cell phones and consumer devices, as well as chips for data center networking equipment.Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the current market leader in chips for PCs and data centers, subsequently bought Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR) for $16.7 billion. Altera develops chips that can be reprogrammed after a product has been shipped.These chips, known as field programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, are used on a wide variety of platforms, including consumer devices, cars, and airplanes. The acquisition was widely seen as a defensive move against the combined threat of Avago and Broadcom in the data center market and a way to expand Intel's Internet of Things business.PHOTO: PIXABAY.But just how much of a threat is Avago to Intel? Let's discuss where their businesses overlap, and whether Intel investors should be worried.Intel widens its defensive moatIntel currently controls more than 98% of the data center market. Last quarter, Intel's data center revenue rose 19% annually to $3.68 billion and accounted for 29% of Its top line. The unit accounted for nearly two-thirds of Intel's operating income.Intel and Altera were already partners, having merged Intel's Atom and Xeon CPUs with Altera's FPGA. On their own, Altera's chips are less powerful than Intel's, but their reprogrammability makes them more flexible. When combined with Intel's chips, Altera's FPGAs are expected to boost workloads and lower power consumption in data centers. This makes them attractive to data- and power-hungry companies such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon.com.Several of those companies have already started using microservers -- cheap servers that employ low-powered chips to perform dedicated tasks such as loading the images of a webpage. Companies purchase microservers in ""clusters,"" which lets them only buy the processing power they need.Intel already has a strong presence in microservers with the Xeon E3, Xeon D, and Atom C2000 SoCs. But rival ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) previously declared that its licensees, such as Hewlett-Packard, could claim 10% of the server market by 2017 with microservers.HP'S MOONSHOT SYSTEM MICROSERVER. PHOTO: HP.Acquiring Altera's FPGA tech helps Intel widen its defensive moat against ARM with power-efficient hybrid CPU-FPGA designs, which will likely be fused together on single chips in the near future. In the conference call to discuss the acquisition, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said  that up to a third of cloud service providers could be using hybrid CPU-FPGA server nodes by 2020. Intel expects the entire FPGA market to grow at a 7% compound annual rate from 2014 to 2023.Avago's data center strategyMeanwhile, Avago started expanding into the data center market in 2013 when it acquired disk controller company LSI for $6.6 billion. To raise cash last year, Avago sold its solid-state storage controller business to Seagate or $450 million and the Axxia wireless networking chip business (which was part of LSI) to Intel for $650 million.Avago used that cash to buy PCI-Express chip and switch maker PLX Technology, along with Emulex, a maker of Fibre Channel and Ethernet adapter cards. From Broadcom, Avago gains its Trident and Dune Ethernet switch chips, which control a dominant share of the data center switch chip market. Its investments in disk controllers, PCI-Express chips and ethernet switches give Avago the ability to sell data center solutions in bundles.SOME OF AVAGO'S DATA CENTER SOLUTIONS. PHOTO: AVAGO.But the direct threat to Intel is Broadcom's interest in ARM-based server processors. Broadcom later this year is scheduled to release its Vulcan 64-bit ARM server processors, which will compete against Cavium's ThunderX, AMD's Opteron, and Qualcomm's upcoming ARM server chips.By buying Broadcom, Avago becomes the third-largest chipmaker in the world by revenue after Intel and Qualcomm. If Avago and Qualcomm both invest heavily in ARM-based microservers, Intel's market share in data centers could suffer.Should Intel investors worry?I believe Intel investors don't have to worry about Avago disrupting the server market anytime soon. Avago has certainly gained ground in networking hardware and might establish a presence in ARM servers, but the overall market for ARM servers is still quite small.Intel already has a presence in microservers, and the flexibility and power efficiency of Altera's FPGAs could further marginalize ARM's market presence."
Better Value Play: Western Digital Corp. or Seagate Technology PLC?,"May 6, 2016 at 9:09AM","Hard-drive makers Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) were both recently pummeled after reporting dismal third-quarter earnings. Both companies were hit hard by a slowdown in PC sales and the cannibalization of HDDs (hard-disk drives) by SSDs (solid-state drives).IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.Shares of WD and Seagate have both declined more than 60% over the past 12 months, which boosted their dividend yields to historic highs. But does that make either stock an attractive income-generating value play?How bad were the numbers?During the first quarter, WD's revenue fell 20.6% annually to $2.82 billion, which missed forecasts by $40 million. Seagate's revenue dropped 21.9% to $2.6 billion, which matched estimates. Both companies' revenues have been falling ever since 2013 and aren't expected to bottom anytime soon.SOURCE: YCHARTS.WD's hard drive shipments declined 21% annually to 43.1 million as sales into notebooks, desktops, consumer electronics, branded devices, and enterprise products all weakened. Seagate's shipments declined 22% to 39.2 million, with enterprise and client computing drive sales falling but consumer electronics and branded shipments slightly rising.Both companies' non-GAAP gross margins narrowed. WD's declined from 30.5% a year ago to 28.1%, while Seagate's fell from 28.9% a year ago to 22.7%. That decline caused WD's non-GAAP net income to fall 26% annually to $283 million, or $1.21 per share, missing estimates by $0.07. Seagate's non-GAAP net income plunged 82% to $66 million, or $0.22 per share, which came in $0.15 below expectations. The long-term chart also reveals a clear downtrend in earnings growth.SOURCE: YCHARTS.Pivoting toward new marketsWD is trying to offset its losses in HDDs by pivoting toward SSDs and flash memory. It's doing this inorganically through the acquisitions of Hitachi's hard drive business, SSD maker STec, enterprise storage company Virident Systems, storage software maker Velobit, flash storage array maker Skyera, and flash storage giant SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK). After the SanDisk deal closes, WD will control around 14% of the global SSD market, making it the second largest vendor after market leader Samsung.WD also expects the full integration of HGST (Hitachi Global Storage Technologies) -- which was cleared by Chinese regulators last October -- to generate $800 million in cost savings by the end of 2017, up from its prior guidance of $650 million.Seagate spent a lot of money consolidating the fragmented HDD market over the past decade, but it's spent a lot less money on SSDs and flash memory. The company's main foothold in that market is a multi-year NAND supply and enterprise SSD alliance with Micron (NASDAQ:MU), which controls around 10% of the SSD market. It also produces SSHDs (solid-state hybrid drives), which boot up faster than an HDD but cost much less than an SSD. Like WD, Seagate will generate some cost savings from its full integration of Samsung's HDD operations, which was also approved by Chinese regulators last year.But investing in SSDs might not be enoughWD and Seagate are trying to counter the cannibalization of their core HDD businesses by diversifying into SSDs, but both companies could merely be shifting from one commoditized market into another.DRAMeXchange claims that 2.5"" SSDs cost 11 times more than HDDs on a dollar per GB basis in 2012, but they now only cost about 6.5 times as much. The company expects that gap to narrow to 2.8 times in 2017 and potentially achieve price parity a few years later. If this happens before WD and Seagate diversify enough of their business away from HDDs, their core businesses could collapse.Valuations and dividendsWD trades at 9 times earnings, and Seagate has a higher P/E of 18, but both ratios remain lower than the industry average of 23 for data storage companies. Looking ahead, analysts expect WD's earnings to fall 1.5% annually over the next five years, while Seagate's earnings are expected to decline 6%.WD's forward dividend yield of 5.1% looks sustainable with a payout ratio of 44%, but the company suspended buybacks to pay off debt related to the SanDisk acquisition. Meanwhile, Seagate's forward dividend yield of 13% looks completely unsustainable with a payout ratio well over 200%.The better value play: Western DigitalWD and Seagate are both in bad shape, but WD is clearly the better pick. Its margins are higher, its valuations are lower, its dividend is sustainable, and it's better invested in the future through its acquisition of SanDisk. Seagate must make big changes to keep up -- otherwise it could be left in the dust by WD, Samsung, and other major storage players within the next few years.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Why SanDisk, Western Digital, and Seagate Technology Plunged in 2015","Jan 12, 2016 at 2:00PM","What: Shares of SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) fell 22.4% in 2015, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. Fellow data storage specialists Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) plunged 45.8% and 44.9% lower, respectively. It was a tough year for storage stocks in general.So what: SanDisk's massive loss actually includes a 60% gain in October, where Western Digital agreed to buy the solid-state storage specialist for nearly 35 times SanDisk's trailing earnings. Without that buyout premium, SanDisk investors would have faced an even larger negative return in 2015.You'll note, of course, that the deal did nothing to lift Western Digital out of its year-long swan dive. All three companies suffered from the same overarching market trends: Plunging PC system sales, the never-ending march toward lower component prices, and weak demand even from the enterprise sector.SNDK REVENUE (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.Now what: Western Digital's buyout of SanDisk can be seen as two sinking ships trying to stay afloat by clinging together.The reality is that data storage of all kinds is becoming a commodity. Charging a premium for higher storage density or faster access used to juice the margins and support revenues even in the face of rapidly falling prices per megabyte, then gigabyte, terabyte, and beyond. That's not really the case right now.The traditional hard drive space is down to two strong providers, namely Western Digital and Seagate, plus fringe player Toshiba. Hard drives are going obsolete, and the newfangled solid state drives are still too expensive.Eventually, this snarled market environment will sort itself out. Western Digital, with SanDisk's solid-state expertise under its wing, will start building Flash-based storage into every device it sells. Seagate must be working feverishly on its own Flash technologies, perhaps looking around for a billion-dollar acquisition of its own in that space.Look up ""cyclical"" in a dictionary, and you might just see a picture of a hard drive. This market goes in waves, and is currently on a downswing after a few strong years. Will 2016 be different? Hard to say, but there will eventually be a light at the end of the tunnel.In 2015, that light was still far away, covered up, and turned off.10 stocks we like better than SanDisk CorpWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Seagate Technology PLC Stock Tumbled Today,"Apr 29, 2016 at 11:19AM","IMAGE SOURCE: SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY.What: Shares of hard disk drive manufacturer Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) tumbled on Friday following the company's fiscal third-quarter report. Seagate's earnings came in well below analyst expectations, driven by a steep drop in revenue and a less-steep drop in expenses. At 10:45 a.m. ET the stock was down about 15%.So what: Seagate reported quarterly revenue of $2.6 billion, down 22.1% year over year and in line with analyst expectations. A weak PC market, which saw shipments slump 11.5% during the first calendar quarter, as well as the growing attractiveness of solid state drives, drove down demand for Seagate's products.Seagate reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.22, down from $1.08 during the prior-year period and $0.15 below the average analyst estimate. On a GAAP basis, Seagate reported a loss of $0.07 per share, down from a gain of $0.88 per share during the prior-year period. Total expenses declined by 14% year over year, far slower than revenue, while Seagate's GAAP gross margin tumbled to 20.2%, down from 28.7% during the same period last year.Now what: Despite the weak results, Seagate maintained its generous quarterly dividend of $0.63 per share. CEO Steve Luczo pointed to the long-term picture. ""Our quarterly results fell short of our expectations as a result of several near-term demand factors. Despite these challenges, we believe we have the product portfolio, technology roadmap and operational leverage to ensure we are well-positioned for long-term success. Accordingly, we are aggressively working to position Seagate to respond to new demand levels and are committed to ongoing financial discipline.""For the fourth quarter, Seagate expects revenue to decline to $2.3 billion, representing a 21.4% year-over-year drop. Analysts expected revenue of $2.61 billion. With a very challenging environment for Seagate erasing the company's profits, and with no relief expected anytime soon, investors are running away from the hard drive manufacturer."
Why Seagate Technology PLC Plunged 36.8% in April,"May 14, 2016 at 9:10AM","STX DATA BY YCHARTSWhat: Shares of Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) fell 36.8% in April 2016, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. This massive plunge was served in two portions, although both events were really about the same thing.So what: On April 13, Seagate posted preliminary sales results for the third quarter. The early tally pointed to third-quarter revenue of $2.6 billion, down from original guidance of $2.7 billion. Furthermore, adjusted gross margins were headed to roughly 23% -- also below guidance for 25.6%. The company had a litany of reasons for this underperformance, boiling down to weak demand across many end markets and product lines.Seagate shares closed 20.1% lower the next day.But the other shoe had yet to drop. On April 29, Seagate published its full third-quarter results. Sales were indeed $2.6 billion, a 22% year-over-year drop. Adjusted gross margins came in even lower than the updated guidance, stopping at 22.7%. Non-GAAP earnings tumbled from $0.77 to $0.22 per share, far below Wall Street's $0.37 consensus estimate.That evening, share prices fell another 19%.Now what: The pain didn't end there. Seagate's stock price has declined by another 13% through the first week and a half of May, and the losses add up to 67% over the last 52 weeks. The company's credit rating is now on a negative watch, as the rating firms now doubt that Seagate can live up to its financial obligations in the long run.CEO Steve Luczo chalks all of this up to ""short-term dynamics of our industry,"" with growing demand for the kind of affordable large-scale storage solutions that only magnetic platters can provide.Seagate is putting its money where Luczo's mouth is, stoically announcing a $0.63 dividend payment per share right alongside the final Q3 report. That's 286% of Seagate's adjusted earnings, or 170% of the company's free cash flow in the quarter. At current share prices, this works out to a kingly 13.4% dividend yield. But unless Luczo can deliver on his promises of an end to difficult ""short-term dynamics,"" that dividend policy simply isn't sustainable.If that rebound is coming up soon, Seagate should bounce back from these deep, dark depths. But if we're truly reaching the end of the magnetic-disk era in mass data storage, the stock will just keep on falling. And since both outcomes are entirely possible, there are big downside risks for both buyers and short-sellers. I prefer to simply keep my hands off this difficult stock today."
"3 Stocks With Better Dividends Than AT&T, Inc.","Apr 20, 2016 at 9:04AM","IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL.This article was updated on Nov. 11, 2016, and originally published on April 20, 2016.On its own merits, AT&T (NYSE:T) sure looks like a mighty fine dividend stock. The current dividend yield stands at a generous 5%, at the tail end of 31 consecutive years of annual payout boosts. It's a bona fide Dividend Aristocrat, backed by a well-known brand and a $230 billion market cap.What's not to love?As it turns out, there are many ways to improve on AT&T as a dividend play. Let me show you why I would rather own 3M (NYSE:MMM), American Tower (NYSE:AMT), or Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) in a dividend-focused portfolio today -- all for very different reasons.Bigger isn't always betterLet's start with industrial innovator 3M. Like AT&T, this is another giant of American industry -- a familiar name in any household. But their long-term dividend strategies are extremely different.At first glance, it's easy to get stuck on the current dividend yields. There, Ma Bell easily takes the crown with a solid 5.4% yield versus 3M's less exceptional 2.6%. No need to dig any deeper, because this fight is already over. Right?Not so fast. Have you seen this chart?T DIVIDEND DATA BY YCHARTSIn plain English, this is 3M putting a lead foot on its dividend accelerator in recent years. Since 2013, management has committed to returning a lot of cash to shareholders -- mostly via generous dividend increases and share buyback programs.If you thought that AT&T's 31-year history of modest dividend increases was impressive, 3M's streak is nearly twice as long, And at least in recent years, 3M's payout boosts have been far more generous.Moreover, AT&T's management is currently focused on using spare cash to pay down debt rather than raise dividends. In contrast, 3M is using its superior credit rating to add more debt to bolster its balance sheet -- leaving lots of room for large dividend increases.In the eyes of many income investors, consistent and lavish dividend growth trumps rich yields paired with stagnant growth. That's how the comparison between 3M and AT&T works out, and it's in 3M's favor.Short but sweetMoving on to wireless tower operator American Tower, that company does not come with decades of dividend history. This dividend policy is only 4 years old, but investors have enjoyed some massive increases over that short span:T DIVIDEND DATA BY YCHARTSGranted, American Tower's yield stops far below AT&T's huge payout. Today, the ratio stands at just 2.1%.However, as a real estate investment trust, generous dividends are absolutely required. REITs must funnel at least 90% of their pre-tax profits into dividend payments, or else lose the tax benefits of being a REIT.In other words, these payouts will continue to rise at least as quickly as American Tower's bottom-line profits. The company is even going beyond the call of duty, as dividend payouts are soaring much faster than either EBIT profits or free cash flows.American Tower may not be a household name of the same caliber as AT&T or 3M, but its services are nonetheless vital to running a functional wireless network in North America and beyond. The company is likely to stay relevant and healthy at least as long as smartphones need a tower-based data network. In the long run, American Tower stands a good chance of joining the Dividend Aristocrats list. Just keep in mind that I'm building that conclusion on a fairly short dividend history, augmented by what we know about REIT stocks in general.The best of both worlds?And that brings us to our last stop today, hard-drive builder Seagate Technology.Here's a dominant force in the hard-drive business, with only one serious rival to speak of. Seagate's dividends per share have more than tripled over the last five years while AT&T's only increased by 11.6%. And unlike American Tower and 3M, whose stock charts have been robust, Seagate is going through a trough in a very cyclical market, driving dividend yields higher as share prices fall. Today, Seagate's 7% yield is far richer than AT&T's:T DIVIDEND YIELD (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTSIt is understood that this stock comes with a heaping dose of risk. That's already baked into the stock price, of course. Shares took another dive last week, when management lowered its revenue guidance for the current quarter.But we're talking about a fantastic history of dividend increases, on top of the option to lock in downright drool-inducing dividend yields at today's low share prices. Unless you think that hard drives and bulk data storage are going the way of the dodo, it's hard not to get enthusiastic about Seagate as a dividend stock.There you have it. 3M beats AT&T in terms of dividend history and commitment to raising its payouts. American Tower is a hot newcomer to the dividend game, but what a start! And Seagate combines massive dividend growth with a nearly double-digit starting yield.In short, it's not hard at all to find better dividend stocks than AT&T."
The 10 Worst Stocks in the Nasdaq in 2015,"Jan 17, 2016 at 8:03PM","IMAGE: BFISHADOW, FLICKR.The Nasdaq 100 Index did much better than the Dow and S&P 500, picking up gains of 8% in what was generally a flat year for the broader benchmarks. Yet even though many of the tech stocks that make up the biggest stocks on the Nasdaq stock exchange exploded higher, some sectors of the index held its performance back. Let's look at the 10 worst performers in the Nasdaq 100 in 2015 to see what they say about the weakest areas of the stock market right now.Stock2015 ReturnMicron Technology(59.6%)Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC)(44.3%)Viacom (NASDAQ:VIAB)(43.7%)Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX)(42.4%)Bed Bath & Beyond(36.7%)NetApp(34.7%)Yahoo!(34.2%)Whole Foods Market(32.7%)Qualcomm(30.6%)21st Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX)(28.6%)SOURCE: S&P CAPITAL IQ.Perhaps the most interesting thing about this list is that there aren't any energy companies on it. That's a reflection on the composition of the Nasdaq 100, as large players in the oil and gas industry have consistently chosen to list of the NYSE instead.Hard-driving declinesStill, you can see some broad themes play out on the list. First, the presence of hard-disk drive giants Western Digital and Seagate Technology point to the difficulties that the storage industry has had over the past year. Despite getting some respite from a brief uptick in PC demand in 2014, both companies have seen demand shift away from traditional hard-disk drive storage toward solid-state solutions.Western Digital has attempted to bolster its position in that space by buying flash-expert SanDisk, but intense competition among flash-drive players has also put a crimp in profits there. Seagate, meanwhile, has focused on returning capital to shareholders through a strong dividend as a massive repurchase program. Neither strategy has inspired confidence in their stocks, but Seagate and Western Digital trade at attractive valuations as long as you think their businesses won't fall apart entirely.Eventually, both companies will likely come up with more modern storage technology solutions for its clients. But 2015's performance shows that Western Digital and Seagate Technology have further to go before they get there.Media falloutThe other major theme among losing stocks in the Nasdaq was the difficulty in the media industry. Both Viacom and 21st Century Fox have extensive exposure to the cable television industry, and cord-cutting among cable subscribers has led to a decline in viewership for their respective networks. Competition from streaming-video companies producing their own content has also presented increasing challenges for the media companies, and Fox has had to deal with increased prices for showing valuable sports content that have posed long-term threats to profitability if viewership trends don't reverse course and support rising payments to major professional sports organizations.Fox can point to potential success on the film side of its business as a hedge against the cable industry's woes, but Viacom is arguably more dependent on traditional cable programming. Major cable networks hope that they can find ways to circumvent cable companies entirely, going direct to viewers by offering access to programming through home broadband and mobile devices. Yet unless they can find a way to sustain advertising rates in a shift toward mobile -- something that tech companies have struggled with -- then Fox and Viacom could see further pressure in the years to come.Even though the Nasdaq 100 outperformed most market indexes last year, there were pockets of weakness that demand attention. By looking at prevailing trends, you can work toward outperforming the indexes by avoiding tough sectors like these and focusing instead on the companies with the best future prospects.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Western Digital Corp. Fell 13.5% in April,"May 15, 2016 at 10:23AM","What: Shares of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) fell 13.5% in April 2016, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The hard-drive giant mirrored the chart moves produced by Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), but with a much lower amplitude. By the end of the month, Seagate's plunge had stretched all the way to 36.8%.So what: When Seagate lowered its quarterly sales and margin guidance, Western Digital took a sympathy plunge to the tune of 7%. That was nowhere near Seagate's 22% pain, partly because the news wasn't Western Digital's own, and partly because the company had some good news of its own that could soften the blow. That day, Western Digital also closed the books on $5.2 billion of debt notes, bringing the company one step closer to consummating its merger with SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK).The SanDisk deal is a crucial move that could keep Western Digital relevant for years beyond the death of hard drives based on magnetic platters. Seagate has no equivalent play on the solid-state drive market, where data is stored on flash-based memory chips. Hence, news items that take Western Digital closer to that merger can cancel out negativity from the traditional hard-drive segment.When both companies reported earnings on April 28, Seagate fell far short of Wall Street's estimates while Western Digital came much closer. On top of that, SanDisk also reported results the same night -- and beat expectations. So Seagate fell another 19% the next day, but Western Digital's drop was a more subdued 11%. Still painful, but it could have been worse.Now what: Seagate is swimming in dire straits these days, while Western Digital appears to have a viable long-term plan. Closing that SanDisk deal is absolutely essential, but the final roadblock fell on May 10. After final approval from Chinese regulators, the deal is now expected to close on May 12.As the merger unfurled, Western Digital shares have fallen more than 60% over the last 52 weeks. Buy today, and you'll lock in a solid 5.2% dividend yield. And Western Digital can back its payouts with just 56% of its trailing earnings or 31% of free cash flows. Seagate's dividend payments don't come with that kind of cash-based guarantee.If I had to pick a hard drive play at this point, Western Digital looks like the healthier choice -- and the race isn't even close.10 stocks we like better than SanDisk CorpWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Will 2016 Be Western Digital Corp's Worst Year Yet?,"Jan 21, 2016 at 11:34AM","Shares of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) have tumbled more than 20% since the beginning of the year, extending its 12-month decline to 56%. However, that drop has reduced its trailing P/E to just 8, a big discount to the industry average of 15, while its dividend yield has hit a historic high of 4.2%. Do those figures now make Western Digital a compelling value stock? Or could 2016 be the storage device maker's worst year yet?SOURCE: PIXABAY.The good newsWestern Digital and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) control over 80% of the global market for platter-based hard disk drives (HDDs). But over the past decade, the HDD market has been cannibalized by flash-based solid state drives (SSDs). SSDs are more expensive than HDDs, but they run faster, use less power, don't have damage-prone platters, and fit better in ultrathin notebooks and tablets. Between the third quarters of 2011 and 2015, TrendFocus estimates that global HDD shipments fell from 175.3 million to 118.6 million.To counter that decline, Western Digital expanded its core business away from HDDs and toward SSDs. It acquired Hitachi's hard drive business, SSD maker STec, enterprise storage firm Virident Systems, storage software maker Velobit, flash storage array maker Skyera, and flash storage giant SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK). WD will control 14% of the SSD market after the SanDisk deal closes, according to Kitguru. That will make it the second largest SSD maker in the world after Samsung, which controls nearly half the market.There were also two positive developments for WD in China last year. First, state-backed Tsinghua's Unisplendour bought a 15% stake in the company to expand its data storage portfolio. Second, the Chinese government finally approved WD's integration of Hitachi's hard drive business after three years of antitrust-related delays. The combination of WD and Hitachi's manufacturing and supply operations should cut production costs of data storage devices for the Chinese market. To balance out the market, the Chinese government also approved Seagate's integration of Samsung's HDD operations, which had been stalled for similar reasons.The bad newsThe problem with Western Digital's SSD strategy is that it's a costly one that was arguably executed too late. WD will fund the $19 billion SanDisk acquisition by taking on $18.4 billion in debt and suspending its buyback program. By comparison, it finished last quarter with $2.1 billion in long-term debt and $5.9 billion in total liabilities. WD will keep paying dividends, but it's unclear if it can keep raising that payout annually. WD's buyout offer also valued SanDisk at 35 times earnings -- a steep premium considering that analysts expect SanDisk's earnings to decline 2% annually over the next five years.SOURCE: PIXABAY.DRAMeXchange recently noted that 2.5-inch SSDs cost 11 times more than HDDs on a dollar-per-GB basis in 2012, but they now cost just 6.5 times as much. The company also expects next-gen 3D NAND technology to narrow that gap to just 2.8 times by 2017. SanDisk notably lags behind Samsung in 3D NAND technology, which means that WD's HDD commoditization problems could play out again with SSDs.To make matters worse, sales of PCs, which are crucial to HDD and SSD makers, continue to decline. IDC recently estimated that global PC shipments fell 10.6% annually in the fourth quarter of 2015. Although the market is expected to stabilize this year as more consumers replace their aging PCs, that growth might coincide with bigger price declines in HDDs and SSDs.Lower demand and price declines will weigh down WD and Seagate's margins and bottom line growth. Last quarter, WD's gross margin fell from 29.1% in the prior year quarter to 28.4%. Seagate's fell from 28.1% to 24.2%. Looking ahead, growth looks weak -- analysts expect WD's annual earnings to grow just 2.3% annually over the next five years, and for Seagate's to rise 4%. That gives WD and Seagate respective 5-year PEG ratios of 3.2 and 2.7. Since a PEG ratio under 1 is considered undervalued, neither stock looks cheap based on its earnings growth potential.Will it be Western Digital's worst year yet?2016 probably won't be pretty for Western Digital, but it probably won't be the company's ""worst"" year yet. Its worst years in recent history were 2008, when the stock lost three-fourths of its value, and 2015, when it plunged nearly 50%. For now, WD's low P/E and 4.2% yield will probably limit its downside potential. However, its upside potential will also probably be limited because of ongoing concerns about sluggish PC sales and the commoditization of the HDD and SSD markets.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Upgrades: 3 Facts You Must Know About Micron Technology's Big Boost,"Feb 16, 2016 at 1:00PM","With the stock down 5% over the past two weeks, Goldman Sachs may have been early in recommending Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) shares two weeks ago -- but that doesn't mean Goldman was wrong. Indeed, more and analysts are starting to agree with Goldman Sachs: Micron stock has bottomed.The newsOn Tuesday, investment banker Mizuho Securities clambered aboard the Micron bandwagon. According to StreetInsider.com, Mizuho has just upgraded Micron shares to ""buy,"" and says the shares that cost just $10 and change today are really worth closer to $12.But is Mizuho right? Here are three facts you need to know to decide.Fact 1: Micron costs less than its book valueKey to Mizuho's buy thesis for Micron is the fact that Micron shares currently cost just 0.8 times the book value of the stock. (Currently, data from S&P Global Market Intelligence put the valuation at closer to 0.9 times book value of $11.89 per share -- but this is after the stock jumped in price in reaction to Mizuho's upgrade.)In any case, Mizuho says this is close to a ""trough valuation"" for the stock. What's more, the stock could look even cheaper once it has absorbed Inotera. With its erstwhile rival's assets incorporated into it, Micron's book value could rise by another $2 to $3, says Mizuho.That could put Micron's book value close to $15. At which point, even if investors continue to value Micron at only 0.8 times book, the stock should be worth $12. A price closer to Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) 1-times-book-valuation, on the other hand, would imply a price of $15 for Micron stock. And if investors were ever to price Micron closer to the 2.4 times book value at SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK), or the 4.9 times book value at Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) -- Micron stock could soar.Fact 2: There's a reason why Micron shares might go upWhat would it take to convince investors to pay so much more for Micron than they're willing to pay today? One possibility would be a buyout. Part of the reason that SanDisk shares cost so much, relative to their book value, is that Western Digital agreed to pay a big premium to buy SanDisk. At a market capitalization of less than $11 billion, Micron currently costs less than SanDisk, so a buyout doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility.But even absent a takeover, Mizuho sees thinks Micron could grow just fine on its own. According to the analyst, gross margins on DRAM memory appear to be improving -- and DRAM sales make up nearly 60% of Micron's business.Fact 3: Mizuho's not aloneMizuho isn't the only analyst singing Micron's praises today, either. Simultaneous with Mizuho's upgrade, Susquehanna Securities (which already had a positive rating on Micron stock) announced that although 2016 could continue to be tough for Micron, it sees a ""strong rebound"" in Micron's share price in 2017.According to Susquehanna, ""unit economics"" could begin improving toward the second half of this year, with gross margins improving in both Micron's DRAM and NAND memory businesses. Valuing the stock roughly at the same level as Western Digital's 1 times book value, Susquehanna predicts a $15 share price for Micron.And one more fact...All that being said, and as positive as these three analysts -- Goldman, Susquehanna, and now Mizuho, too -- are about the stock, there's still one more fact you need to consider before acting on today's upgrade:The analyst making the upgrade today is not good. In fact, it's kind of horrible.According to our data here at Motley Fool CAPS, where we've been tracking Mizuho's performance as an analyst for more than four years now, Mizuho Securities ranks in the bottom 20% of investors we track. Over the past four-plus years, fewer than 34% of Mizuho's stock recommendations have succeeded in outperforming the S&P 500 -- and on average, Mizuho's picks are underperforming the stock market by more than 13 percentage points per pick.What's more, when it comes to picking semiconductor stocks, Mizuho does even worse:Company  Mizuho Said:CAPS Says:Mizuho's Picks Beat (Lagged) S&P By:Altera CorpOutperform****4 pointsLattice SemiconductorOutperform***(35 points)Marvell TechnologyOutperform****(84 points)None of which has me feeling particularly enthusiastic about Mizuho's endorsement of Micron Technology stock today.A better way to make moneyGranted, Micron has the lowest P/B ratio of any of the memory-makers we've covered so far -- Micron, Seagate, Western Digital, and Western D's new prize, SanDisk. Granted, too, Micron's sub-6 valuation gives it the lowest P/E ratio of any stock on this list.But Micron also generates less free cash flow than any other stock on this list. Indeed, Global Market Intelligence puts Micron's FCF number at just $394 million -- a mere fraction of the $2.1 billion that Micron reported as its net income for the past 12 months. And according to Susquehanna's note today, Micron will probably need to up its capital spending as high as $5.3 billion to $5.8 billion this year, driving its free cash flow into negative territory.If you ask me, that prospect is likely to keep a lid on Micron shares at least through the balance of this year. I'm much more optimistic about the prospects for Seagate stock (trading at just 8.3 times free cash flow) or Western Digital, which costs less than 6 times FCF. Not only do those two offer better valuations than Micron does -- they also pay solid dividend yields...which Micron does not.Long story short: If you're going to be waiting around a year for the memory market to recover, you might as well get paid a dividend while you wait. Seagate and Western Digital will pay you that dividend.Micron won't.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip. Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner and his brother, Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner, just revealed two brand new stock recommendations. Together, they've tripled the stock market's return over the last 13 years.* And while timing isn't everything, the history of Tom and David's stock picks shows that it pays to get in early on their ideas.Click here to be among the first people to hear about David and Tom's newest stock recommendations.*Stock Advisor returns as of April 2, 2018"
3 Reasons Micron Technology Stock Could Rise,"May 24, 2016 at 11:00AM","IMAGE SOURCE: MICRON TECHNOLOGY.Shares of memory-chip maker Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) have lost nearly 70% of their value since peaking in late 2014. Oversupply in the DRAM and NAND markets has ravaged the company's bottom line, turning once-record profits into losses. During Micron's latest quarter, the company reported a steep 30% year over year drop in revenue and a $97 million net loss.MU DATA BY YCHARTSThe worst for Micron may not be over, but there are a few reasons why the stock could rise over the next few years.Trouble in the hard-drive marketWhile DRAM accounts for the majority of Micron's revenue, NAND is an important business for the company as well. The NAND market has been rough for Micron recently, with the company's storage segment posting a loss in each of the past five quarters.One development that could help Micron's NAND business is the deteriorating state of the hard-drive market. Between Seagate, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Toshiba, hard-drive unit shipments plunged by 20% year over year during the first quarter. A weak PC market is one driving force, but the rapidly falling price of solid-state drives is also a factor. Western Digital recently closed on its acquisition of NAND manufacturer SanDisk, with the company recognizing that hard drives are unlikely to be a growth market going forward.Only a mid-teens percentage of Micron's NAND revenue came from solid-state drives during the company's latest quarter, with the bulk coming from memory cards and USB drives. But the SSD market is growing, with research company MarketsAndMarkets expecting total SSD sales to grow by 9.5% annually between 2016 and 2022. Unit sales should grow even faster as prices fall.One way to put an end to an oversupply situation is for demand to increase, and rising demand for SSDs could help put Micron's storage business back into the black. That would give investors a reason to push the stock higher.3D XPointMicron and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) jointly developed 3D XPoint, a new type of memory that is non-volatile like NAND but both faster and more durable. Intel is expected to release SSDs based on 3D XPoint sometime this year, and Micron will be free to launch its own products as well. The relationship between Intel and Micron is somewhat unclear, and Micron will apparently be competing directly with Intel. But if 3D XPoint memory is widely adopted, it could create an entirely new revenue stream for Micron.3D XPoint could either replace DRAM, NAND, or both, or it could act as a middle layer of memory between them. In data center applications, having a fast middle layer could make sense, allowing databases normally stored on NAND to be sped up significantly. 3D XPoint may also work well in mobile devices, potentially acting as both random-access memory and storage.Micron has previously stated that it doesn't expect meaningful revenue from 3D XPoint until 2017, but the company's expectations after that are sky high. CEO Mark Durcan suggested during the company's summer analyst conference that 3D XPoint could grow to be a $5 billion business by 2018, about half the size of Micron's DRAM business at the time. That outlook may be overly optimistic, but if 3D XPoint lives up to the hype, Micron's stock could soar.Hope for DRAMDRAM accounts for the majority of Micron's revenue, making the current oversupply situation plaguing the industry a major drain on revenue and profits. The PC market has so far shown no real sign of stabilizing, and the smartphone market suffered its first year-over-year unit shipment decline during the first quarter of 2016. Micron's mobile segment was hit particularly hard during the company's latest quarter, with revenue plummeting 40% year over year.The DRAM market may remain weak for a while, but there has been some good news recently. Micron rival SK Hynix forecasted strong DRAM shipment growth when it reported earnings in April, a possible sign that demand is picking up. Samsung, another DRAM rival, has reportedly slowed down supply growth, a move that led Bernstein to raise its price target on Micron to $11 per share and predict that supply tightness would manifest itself by the second half of 2017.Oversupply in the DRAM market will eventually be corrected, either by rising demand or falling supply. Micron's DRAM business will recover as a result, but it's impossible to predict exactly when this will happen. It may be this year, it may be next year, or it may take even longer. With the stock down so much over the past couple of years, any good news on the DRAM front could send Micron stock higher.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This Diverse Income Portfolio Sports an Average Dividend Yield of 7.5%,"Mar 11, 2016 at 6:59AM","IMAGE SOURCE: PICTURES OF MONEY VIA FLICKR.There are a lot of ways for investors to get from the start of their working career to a comfortable retirement, but the easiest way from Point A to B tends to run through dividend-paying stocks. Over time, dividend stocks tend to handily outperform stocks that don't pay a dividend, making them an ideal buy-and-hold candidate.The profits and pitfalls of dividend investingWhat is it about dividend-paying companies that makes them so attractive to the long-term and retired investor? To begin with, dividends act as a beacon that lets investors and retirees know that a company's business model is so fundamentally sound today that it can afford to share a percentage of profits with its shareholders. Secondly, dividends help ease the pain during stock market corrections and bear markets. They don't erase the red arrows, but they certainly help hedge your losses a bit. Finally, and most importantly, dividends can be reinvested back into more shares of stock, allowing your position and future dividends to compound. This last point is where substantial wealth can be created over time.On the flip side, investors have to be prudent not to simply chase a stock with a high dividend yield. Yields are a function of share price, meaning a company with a rapidly deteriorating business model and share price could, in theory, have a high-yield and incorrectly look like a great buy to an income-seeking investor. Income investors need to be willing to look at the entire picture to establish whether a dividend is sustainable.This diverse income portfolio has triple the yield of the S&P 500So what do you do if you want a high-yield portfolio that's also diverse? The answer is you scour the nearly 400 companies currently yielding 5% or higher and come up with a short list of five diverse high-yield giants that could add some real kick to your nest egg. This is precisely what I did, and the average yield of the following income portfolio that I'm about to share is 7.5%, or triple the current yield of the S&P 500. With yields like this, your nest egg could double from the dividend alone about once every decade.Let's have a look at which five companies make the cut.Seagate Technology: Technology, 7.4% yieldThe technology sector isn't known for its dividends, but Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is among the best exceptions. Many investors worry about the emergence of solid-state drives and what that might do to Seagate's bread-and-butter hard-disk drive segment, but it appears to be more an overreaction than anything.IMAGE SOURCE: SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY.What's driving Seagate's growth is the expectation of a storage demand increase from enterprises for cloud computing and data centers. Seagate actually has both hard-drive and solid-state drive selections to offer enterprises, thus covering both bases.Additionally, Seagate has been purchasing back its stock hand-over-fist. After announcing a $2.5 billion share repurchase program in 2012, Seagate, in April 2015, announced another $2.5 billion share buyback. Share buybacks can make a company's valuation look particularly attractive. Between the buybacks and its 7.4% yield, it's easy to see why income investors may want to hang onto this stock for years.GlaxoSmithKline: Healthcare, 6% yieldGlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) hasn't had the easiest go of things over the past couple of years due to the imminent emergence of a generic version of inhaled COPD and asthma blockbuster Advair. The good news is, at least according to GSK's latest results, newer product growth is outpacing the drop we're witnessing in Advair's sales.IMAGE SOURCE: GLAXOSMITHKLINE.Looking toward the future, there's a lot for income investors to latch onto. GSK has a burgeoning HIV franchise that's growing by a triple-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis; its next-generation respiratory franchise is getting off the ground after a modest launch, and it's on pace to launch up to 20 assets by 2020 and perhaps up to 40 by 2025. This is a deep pipeline that shouldn't be overlooked.Considering the pricing power that drugmakers possess, GlaxoSmithKline and its 6% yield have to be on income investors' radars.General Motors: Industrials, 5% yieldUp next, we'll look at a company that's been driving over the competition: General Motors (NYSE:GM). Forget the company that was a debt-riddled disaster from a decade ago, because the new GM is a lean, mean profit machine, and it all starts with innovation.2016 CHEVROLET SILVERADO. IMAGE SOURCE: GENERAL MOTORS.In 2014, after more than a half-decade without a makeover, General Motors redesigned its Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra to the delight of consumer, who've responded by pushing sales of both trucks higher. GM is also benefiting from its innovative interior and exterior focus on its Chevy sedans. According to GM, Chevy remains the fastest-growing full-line brand as of February. We're also seeing positive impacts from GM's focus on vehicle interiors. The addition of infotainment systems has helped improve the perceived luxury of the vehicles GM sells without pushing the sale price of these vehicles out of reach. Lastly, GM's also rejoicing in low fuel prices. Lower gas prices encourage the consumer to buy SUVs and trucks, which come with high margins.Sporting a low forward P/E of five and a 5% yield, this is an income stock that could remain in high gear.Annaly Capital Management: Financials, 11.7% yieldAnnaly Capital Management (NYSE:NLY) may take a lot of flak as a mortgage real estate investment trust (mREIT), but it's been among the highest-yielding dividend stocks over the past decade, and it's likely to remain so moving forward.IMAGE SOURCE: FLICKR USER MARK MOZ.Annaly mostly buys agency-only mortgage-backed securities. What this means is Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae guarantee Annaly's assets against default. Of course, assets that are guaranteed against default often have low yields, thus a rising interest rate environment is often bad news for Annaly because it likes to lever up and pump up its profits. However, the Federal Reserve doesn't look as if it's going to be aggressive with lending rates anytime soon. That's great news for Annaly as it means it can continue to expect low borrowing costs and a steady net interest margin.Annaly is also pushing into higher-yield credit assets in order to boost its net interest margin. It does run the risk of default by adding these assets to its portfolio, but its management has maintained a conservative approach to add a bit of asset diversity. Even if a dividend cut is in Annaly's future, I'd surmise it remains head and shoulders above the S&P 500's average yield.Holly Energy Partners: Basic materials, 7.3% yieldLast, but not least, we have Holly Energy Partners (NYSE:HEP), a midstream oil transportation, terminaling, and storage company, which also happens to be a subsidiary of HollyFrontier.IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.Despite oil being beaten like a punching bag, Holly Energy Partners has done very well thanks to its prime geographic pipeline locations in the central, south-central, and southwestern United States. The company is also benefiting from the ability to pass along price increases, as well as its ongoing pipeline expansion. All told, in fiscal 2015 Holly Energy Partners delivered revenue increases for its refined products pipeline, crude pipeline, and terminaling operations. Only intermediate pipeline revenue declined, and even here it was just by $0.9 million to $28.9 million.Holly Energy Partners' conservative expansion has allowed its cash flow to grow right along with its dividend. In fact, the company has increased its payout in 45 consecutive quarters, with little near-term fears of a cut. These are some figures high-yield investors can possibly get behind. As always, the companies listed above should be considered a starting point for your research into safe, high-yield dividend stocks and not a concrete buy recommendation. Every investor's needs and risk tolerance differs, but these five companies could definitely be worth your time if you're looking to add substantive, diversified income on a regular basis.10 stocks we like better than Annaly Capital ManagementWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is Seagate Technology PLC's Dividend Safe?,"Oct 31, 2016 at 5:15PM","IMAGE SOURCE: SEAGATE.Hard disk-drive maker Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) is particularly interesting to income investors because of what is arguably a very aggressive capital return policy. The company routinely buys back significant amounts of stock, which has contributed to a steep decline in the number of its shares out there in the market.AGGRESSIVE BUYBACK ACTIVITY HAS REDUCED SEAGATE'S SHARE COUNT SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE 2012. IMAGE SOURCE: YCHARTS.However, what's probably more exciting to investors who love capital returns is that Seagate's dividend is quite large and has been growing at a steady pace for years now, though it's worth pointing out that the buybacks and dividends go hand in hand -- a reduced share count helps boost the dividend per share that a company can pay with a given amount of capital.As of writing, the dividend yield on the shares is a healthy 7.38%, and it's reasonable to assume that the company aims to increase it as its financial performance allows.SEAGATE'S DIVIDEND PER SHARE HAS GONE STEADILY UP SINCE 2012. IMAGE SOURCE: YCHARTS.Seagate has historically targeted aggressive dividend yields, but whenever a company's yield seems too good to be true, it leads investors to ask whether the dividend is sustainable. I asked the question last year, and the answer then was in the affirmative. Is that still true nearly a year later? Let's take a closer look. Free cash flow tells much of the storyThe key to a sustainable dividend is a company's ability to generate enough free cash flow to cover that dividend. Look at Seagate's free cash flow per share over the past decade:SEAGATE'S FREE CASH FLOW PER SHARE HAS BEEN VOLATILE OVER THE YEARS. IMAGE SOURCE: YCHARTS.Seagate enjoyed a large surge in free cash flow per share beginning in 2012, and although that figure has come down over the past several years, it's still generating north of $3 per share in free cash flow.The company's current quarterly dividend sits at $0.63 per share, or $2.52 annually, so over the past 12 months the company's dividends have been supported by the free cash flow it managed to generate during that time. The past covered it, but can the future?From the trailing-12-month figures on free cash flow per share, Seagate seems to be raking in enough free cash flow to cover the dividend. However, there's not a lot of wiggle room here. So for investors to be confident in that dividend, they need to have reason to believe that Seagate's underlying business itself won't see a dramatic reduction in free cash flow anytime soon. Going by current analyst estimates, Seagate should be able to generate around $3.72 per share in earnings this year and $3.73 per share next year. (Note that these figures represent averages of a wide range of estimates.)Seagate's free cash flow and earnings per share track very closely, as they generally should, so if Seagate can hit figures in the ballpark of what analysts are looking for, the dividend should be safe at least through the next year. SEAGATE'S EARNINGS PER SHARE AND FREE CASH FLOW PER SHARE TRACK VERY CLOSELY. IMAGE SOURCE: YCHARTS.A solid dividend stock for tech stock investorsSeagate stock has been quite volatile year to date, with the stock losing about half of its value between April and May and then recovering all its lost value, and then some, between May and September.SEAGATE INVESTORS HAVE HAD TO STOMACH SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY YEAR-TO-DATE. IMAGE SOURCE: YCHARTS.In contrast to the company's share price, its dividend has been quite solid and, from the looks of it, should continue to be a reliable source of income for Seagate shareholders for a while yet."
What's Up With Seagate Technology PLC Falling 33% in 2016?,"Jun 27, 2016 at 12:20PM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.What: Shares of hard-drive maker Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) have fallen 33% so far in 2016, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The company's core market is changing quickly, and chief rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is better prepared for the new business reality.So what: Solid-state drives, or SSDs, offer much greater read and write speeds than traditional magnetic disk devices. The old-school hard drives still have their uses, because they offer more storage for the buck and larger sizes in general. But those advantages are eroding, as SSD specialists keep pushing street prices down and device sizes up.These days, you can get a 10-terabyte Seagate hard drive for the modest price of $0.08 per gigabyte. (One terabyte is 1,024 gigabytes.) The largest SSD units stop at roughly 4 terabytes, priced at approximately $0.48 per gigabyte. And the SSD prices are getting downright competitive for consumer-grade devices, where a 250-gigabyte drive costs just $0.36 per GB. In that category, best-selling magnetic drives are going for about $0.05 per gigabyte.Under these circumstances, the total market for traditional hard drives is shrinking fast. Seagate shipped 39.2 million drives in the recently reported third quarter. That's 29% below the 55.2 million drives it shipped two years earlier.STX DATA BY YCHARTS.Now what: The time to find a foothold in the rising SSD market is now, before memory chips get cheap enough to erase the last advantages of owning a magnetic disk model. Western Digital addressed this vital need by buying SSD specialist SanDisk, giving the company an established SSD brand with years of experience in that market. Seagate is still looking for a response to that brilliant move, and coming up short.The company is flailing. In Seagate's latest earnings call, management acknowledged that SSD alternatives are eating into many of its most important markets. But they never addressed an SSD strategy for Seagate itself, beyond lowering production volumes in the areas hardest hit by the market change.Seagate shares have now fallen 65% from the highs of late 2014, giving me little reason to believe in a rebound any time soon. This company needs to surprise us all with a flashy (pun intended) SSD-oriented buyout or the unveiling of an in-house product line for the new age. For now, there are no signs of anything like that."
Can Seagate's Dividend Even Survive?,"Aug 19, 2016 at 8:16AM","IMAGE SOURCE: SEAGATE.It's hard to find a technology stock with a dividend more generous than Seagate's (NASDAQ:STX). The maker of traditional hard-drives currently pays its investors around $0.63 per quarter per share. Trading near $32, Seagate yields almost 8%. Dividend payouts vary from company to company and from industry to industry, but by nearly any standard, Seagate's yield is unusually high. It may seem attractive, but would-be investors should approach with caution.If the market was confident in the sustainability of Seagate's dividend, investors would likely buy the stock en masse, pushing its yield down to a more pedestrian 3% to 5% (chief rival Western Digital, for example, yields just over 4%). The fact that Seagate's yield is so high suggests many investors view the company skeptically, anticipating a reduction in its payout at some point in the near future.However, if Seagate can sustain its dividend, it could reward investors with a steady stream of sizable payments. Let's take a closer look at the prospects for Seagate's dividend.A little high, but manageableFrom the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2014, Seagate's dividend yield remained consistent at around 3%. But early in 2015, Seagate's business began to deteriorate. Over the last 18 months, Seagate's share price has crumbled, and its dividend yield has surged. On two of the company's recent earnings calls, management was asked explicitly about the possibility of a dividend reduction.STX DIVIDEND YIELD (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTSDuring the company's January earnings call, CEO Steve Luczo expressed complete confidence in the dividend going forward. ""Our cash flow relative to our dividend payment is not a concern for us at all,"" he said.But in April, Seagate turned in a disastrous third-quarter report. Unsurprisingly, Luczo's subsequent remarks were far more tempered. ""We would certainly like to keep the dividend level where it is,"" he said. ""[But] obviously, these...pay-out ratios [are high].""CFO Dave Mosley remarked that Seagate's dividend was ""manageable"" but was careful to note that the company's board of directors would make the final determination. ""We think [the dividend] is well manageable, albeit at the higher end of those levels of a pay-out ratio, and obviously up to the board of directors,"" he said.Seagate's payout ratio looks unsustainableIn each of its last three quarters, Seagate paid out $188 million worth of dividends. Operating cash flow, however, has varied, and has been trending down. In the second quarter, Seagate generated $382 million of operating cash flow. That fell to $205 million in the third quarter, and $269 million last quarter. In other words, Seagate has spent almost two-thirds of its operating cash flow on dividend payments since the beginning of the year.Looking at net income, the comparison is even worse. Seagate has recorded a total net income of $301 million in 2016. On a trailing 12-month basis, Seagate's payout ratio is an astounding 293.1%. A year ago, Seagate had $2.5 billion of cash on its balance sheet -- that fell to just $1.13 billion at the end of last quarter.Seagate's management undertook a number of cost-cutting initiatives this summer aimed at reducing its expenses. ""Overall restructuring activities are proceeding as planned, and we expect the financial benefit of these actions will begin to have a positive impact [next quarter],"" Morton said on the company's August earnings call.But over the last four quarters, the drop in Seagate's business has been swift, and for shareholders, alarming. In its fiscal year 2015, Seagate generated $2.65 billion of cash from its operations; that dropped to just $1.68 billion in 2016. At the same time, annual sales fell from $13.74 billion to $11.16 billion.Seagate's business remains tied to the market for traditional PCs, and its core hard-drives are under pressure from increasingly affordable flash-based storage. If Seagate's business continues to deteriorate, a sizable dividend cut seems likely.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Key Takeaways From Broadcom Ltd.'s Earnings Call,"Jun 8, 2016 at 11:30AM","IMAGE SOURCE: BROADCOM. Shares of Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), a fairly broad-based semiconductor company, reached fresh 52-week highs after the company reported strong earnings results and forward guidance. So far, things are looking good for the company, which was recently formed from the combination of Broadcom Corporation and Avago Technologies.On the conference call accompanying the earnings results, management offered a lot of insight into the business. Here are some items from the call that should be of particular interest to potential and current investors in the company.Broadband and switching offsetting wireless and hard disk drive weaknessAccording to CEO Hock Tan, ""demand for hard disk drives and smartphones was weak this quarter."" Broadcom's wireless business depends significantly on sales of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone family of products. Demand for iPhones is known to be weak, and it doesn't help suppliers like Broadcom that the iDevice maker is trying to bring down iPhone channel inventory levels (meaning that suppliers will likely under-ship end demand for iPhones).The relatively weak demand for hard disk drives, as evidenced in the quarterly results from hard disk drive makers Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), also doesn't help Avago's business. The company's enterprise storage sales were down 23% quarter-over-quarter as a result of both the drop in the total addressable market for hard disk drives as well as ""seasonal weakness in the enterprise server storage connectivity market.""Nevertheless, Tan says that the company was able to deliver revenue ""in line with expectation"" as a result of ""strong product cycles from switching and broadband in a wide segment.""Wireless rebound in the coming quarterAlthough weak iPhone demand weighed down the company's wireless business in the most recent quarter (offset somewhat by ""increasing shipments to a large Asian handset OEM""), Tan appears optimistic about the company's wireless segment in the coming quarter.""Moving onto [the] third quarter, we're expecting a very different picture for our wireless segment and expect strong sequential revenue growth in the mid-20% range,"" Tan said.The executive went on to add that this growth will be driven by the ""start of a ramp from a large North American smartphone customer as they transition to their next generation platform enhanced by a substantial increase in Classic Avago's RF content in this new handset.""This is no doubt driven by an improvement in the cellular modem capabilities of the new phone.In addition to an increase in RF content in the new iPhone, Tan says that ""wireless connectivity content will also increase in this new handset."" In other words, expect Apple to advertise a boost in Wi-Fi speeds and capabilities in the next iPhone as well.In a statement intended to preemptively shoot down analyst concerns about the long-term viability of Broadcom's traditional wireless connectivity business (which have come up in prior calls), Tan made the following comment:We anticipate our wireless connectivity business to continue to drive significant innovation for mobile Wi-Fi and Bluetooth applications and expect this product line to be a very key long-term contributor to our wireless segment.Enterprise storage bottoming out this quarterTan says that the company expects further declines in the total addressable market for hard disk drives (negative for Seagate/Western Digital), which will drive Broadcom's enterprise storage revenues down by ""low single digits sequentially.""The good news, though, is that the company expects the current quarter to represent the ""trough for enterprise storage revenue this fiscal year."" Additionally, Tan expects Broadcom to ""continue to gain share in [its] hard disk drive business.""10 stocks we like better than Broadcom LtdWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here's How to Find the Best Dividend Stocks,"Dec 14, 2016 at 12:00PM","Dividend investors often prioritize a stock's yield above all other factors. While a stock's yield is certainly important, it's also important to examine five other key factors -- payout ratios, earnings growth, free cash flow growth, valuations, and historical dividend hikes.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Payout ratiosA stock's payout ratio is the percentage of a company's earnings which are allocated to dividend payments. The lower this percentage is, the more room a company has to grow its dividend. If the payout ratio remains above 100% for several quarters, the dividend is likely unsustainable.For example, hard drive maker Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) has a forward dividend yield of 6.4%, but it also has a whopping payout ratio of 200%. Its bigger rival, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), pays a lower forward yield of 3%, but has a much more sustainable payout ratio of 56%. Income investors who only chase yield would probably buy Seagate instead of Western Digital, but they could be disappointed by a big dividend cut in the future.Earnings growthInvestors should also avoid income stocks with declining earnings. For example, camera maker Canon (NYSE:CAJ) pays a forward yield of 4.7% and has a payout ratio of 86%. However, its earnings are also expected to fall 25% this year and another 5% next year due to the commoditization of the camera market.Those declines will inflate Canon's payout ratio and increase the likelihood of a dividend cut. Moreover, Canon's poor earnings growth is already reflected in the stock's 34% decline over the past five years. Therefore, investing in a declining stock with sliding earnings for a higher yield isn't a sound strategy.Free cash flow growthEarnings-based payout ratios can be distorted by buybacks, follow-on offerings, or all sorts of bottom line adjustments. As a result, some payout ratios don't accurately reflect the sustainability of certain dividends.That's why investors should also check a company's free cash flow (FCF), which is a company's operating cash flow minus its capital expenditures. By comparing a company's total dividend payments over the past year to its FCF, we can calculate the FCF payout ratio -- which more accurately reflects a dividend's sustainability.If we check Seagate again, we'll notice that it only paid out 61% of its FCF as dividends over the past 12 months. This means that Seagate can keep supporting its dividend for now, although the payments exceed its per-share profits every quarter. Companies sometimes do this if they believe that reducing the dividend would cause a big sell-off. But if a company's earnings and FCF payout ratios both exceed 100%, the dividend will likely be cut.ValuationsThe low interest rate environment has made dividend stalwarts more attractive than bonds over the past few years. But that will change as interest rates rise, boosting the yields on high-grade bonds to levels which match those of income-generating stocks. Since bonds are fixed income investments with guaranteed returns, they will become the preferred vehicle of wealth preservation for income investors.As a result, dividend stocks which have rallied to historically high prices and valuations could be aggressively sold off as rates rise. Tobacco giant Altria (NYSE:MO), for example, currently trades at 25 times earnings compared to the industry average of 21 for big tobacco companies. Its yield of 3.5%, while solid, also hovers near a historical low:SOURCE: YCHARTSThis means that Altria, and other dividend stalwarts with high valuations and low yields, will be hit hard by interest rate hikes next year. Investors should avoid those types of dividend stocks and stick with ones that trade at discounts to their industry peers.Dividend hikesLastly, some stocks have high yields but don't raise their dividends annually. A company doesn't need to be a ""dividend aristocrat"" that has raised its payout for over 25 years, but a strong record of dividend hikes indicates that it's dedicated to rewarding long-term, buy-and-hold investors with a consistent cut of its profits.The key takeawayI personally own a lot of dividend stocks, and I've made plenty of mistakes chasing high-yield stocks in the past. But I found that by looking beyond yield, it was easier to find safer income stocks with sustainable yields, consistent dividend hikes, low valuations, and decent profit growth. Therefore, income investors should run their potential dividend plays through these tests to see if they're worthy long-term buys.10 stocks we like better than Altria GroupWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

These Are the 10 Highest-Dividend Stocks by Yield -- but Are Any Worth Buying?,"Jul 8, 2016 at 7:38AM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Many dividend investors focus on squeezing as much income as they can from their investments. Yet although it's easy to find top-yielding dividend stocks, the question is whether they have the combination of stability and growth potential to make them smart investments for the long run. Below, we'll show you the 10 current highest-yielding dividend stocks, and then take a closer look at which companies have the best prospects.The top 10 yields in the stock marketHere are the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the S&P 500 as of July 4:StockDividend YieldWilliams Companies (NYSE:WMB)12.5%Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX)10.5%Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR)8.5%CenturyLink7.4%HCP (NYSE:HCP)6.5%Staples5.4%Kohl's5.3%General Motors (NYSE:GM)5.3%Navient5.2%ONEOK5.2%DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE.The first thing that's evident from this list is that at least one company has already signaled that it's likely to cut its dividend in the near future. Specifically, Williams Companies said in early June that if a planned acquisition by Energy Transfer Equity didn't go through, it would have to reduce its payout next quarter. The pipeline company already paid its most recent quarterly dividend in late June, and although Williams hasn't said exactly how much it would reduce its payout, the carnage in the energy industry could produce a substantial cut.Greater uncertainty among dividend payersSeveral other companies on the list have shareholders concerned about their future prospects. Hard-disk drive manufacturer Seagate has had a double-digit dividend yield for some time, largely because its stock has gotten hit hard over the past year and a half. Share prices are down by two-thirds, and the company recently cut 1,600 jobs in a cost-cutting measure aimed at trying to bolster profitability. With Seagate specifically looking at conserving cash, a dividend cut is a natural place to look.Healthcare real estate investment trust HCP faces a much less pessimistic outlook, but dividend investors still need to keep an eye on the REIT. HCP expects to spin off its ManorCare assets into a separate company, and some believe that the surviving entity might have to reduce its dividend in the immediate aftermath. The company has said it intends to focus on total shareholder return, which it says includes dividend growth. But HCP executives didn't directly contradict an analyst on last quarter's conference call who stated his belief that a cut would be necessary.Getting the job done with dividendsBy contrast, some of the companies on the list stand a better chance of staying on the list for the foreseeable future. Frontier Communications has been on the list for a long time, defying those who have argued that its quarterly payout was unsustainable. Even though Frontier has made severe dividend cuts in the past, continuing acquisitions of new business assets have allowed the telecom company to grow recently. In fact, Frontier actually boosted its dividend last year. Not everyone is convinced that its most recent buyout of assets in Texas, California, and Florida will go as well as the company hopes, but Frontier has repeatedly remained committed to its current dividend and still wants to increase its quarterly payments to shareholders if conditions warrant.IMAGE SOURCE: GENERAL MOTORS.Similarly, General Motors has been unpopular with investors lately, but its fundamentals remain strong. After enjoying a record year in the auto industry in 2015, GM has also seen sales success so far this year. Most shareholders are focusing on the cyclical nature of the auto industry, figuring that there's little chance that the automaker can continue to boost earnings at the pace the company has managed in the past. Yet with its current dividend, General Motors pays only a quarter of its overall earnings to shareholders in quarterly payments. That means that even if GM's business does contract somewhat, the auto giant should still be in a position to sustain its dividend without worrying about a cash crunch.Top-yielding stocks are always enticing, but there's always a story behind them. Only by looking closely at each company can you come up with better answers about its future dividend prospects. There's no guarantee that Frontier and GM will keep their dividend yields where they are, and Seagate and other high-yielders on the list might end up surprising skeptical investors by keeping dividends at current levels. Seeing a high-yield list as a starting point rather than a collection of buy recommendations is a great way to avoid mistakes and become smarter as an investor.10 stocks we like better than Williams CompaniesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Forget Micron Technology, Inc: These 2 Stocks Are Better Buys","Sep 15, 2016 at 1:21PM","Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has rallied more than 20% this year on the belief that tighter DRAM and NAND (flash memory) supplies could boost memory prices across the market. But despite those positive catalysts, Micron sales and earnings growth remain weak. Revenue fell 25% year over year last quarter, compared to a 30% decline in the previous quarter and a 3% decline in the prior-year quarter.IMAGE SOURCE: MICRON.In the NAND market, Micron faces tough competition from larger rivals like Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), Toshiba, and Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) SanDisk. In the mobile DRAM market, it lags behind Samsung and SK Hynix. Analysts expect Micron's sales to fall 24% sales this year, compared to a 1% decline last year.Micron posted a non-GAAP net loss of $0.08 per share last quarter, compared to a loss of $0.05 in the previous quarter and a profit of $0.54 a year earlier. In addition to tough competition, Micron's bottom line has been dragged down by market oversupply, pricing pressures, and challenges from integrating the manufacturing processes of its combined Elpida and Micron fabs. Analysts expect Micron's annual earnings to merely break even at $0.00 this year, compared to a profit of $2.47 per share in 2015. Micron also isn't cheap at 49 times earnings, which is more than four times the average P/E of 11 for the memory chips industry.In my opinion, there are safer ways to play the rebound in memory prices than Micron. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Western Digital, for example, both offer better diversification with exposure to the same markets.Intel's a more diversified computing playIntel left the DRAM market in 1985 amid intense competition, but started jointly developing NAND chips with Micron in 2006. That partnership formed the foundation of Intel's non-volatile memory business, which generated 4% of its sales last quarter. Together, the two companies developed new memory technologies like 3D NAND and 3DXPoint, the latter of which could offer ""1,000 times"" the performance of current-gen NAND chips.A 3DXPOINT WAFER. IMAGE SOURCE: MICRON.Intel frequently highlights non-volatile memory alongside the Data Center, Internet of Things, and Programmable Solutions businesses as ways to diversify its top line beyond PCs. However, the ongoing decline in memory prices caused Intel's non-volatile memory chip revenue to fall 20% annually last quarter. The unit also posted an operating loss of $224 million, down from an operating profit of $92 million in the prior year quarter.Those gloomy figures mirror Micron's results, but Intel generates most of its revenue and operating income from its dominant Client Computing (PC and mobile solutions) and Data Center groups. The ongoing slowdown in PC sales caused Intel's Client Computing revenue to fall 3% annually last quarter, but that decline was partly offset by 5% growth in Data Center revenues.Rising memory prices won't boost Intel's sales as much as Micron's, but Intel offers investors more balanced growth than Micron. Analysts currently expect Intel's revenue to rise 4% this year while earnings are expected to improve 7%. Intel also trades at just 18 times earnings, compared to the industry average of 22 for broad line semiconductor companies, and it pays a forward dividend yield of 2.9% -- while Micron has never paid a dividend.Western Digital's a more diversified NAND playWestern Digital stock slid 14% this year due to sluggish sales of older HDDs (hard disk drives), which were being cannibalized by NAND-based SSDs (solid state drives). However, WD made a bold move and purchased SanDisk for $19 billion earlier this year.The purchase instantly made it the third largest NAND maker in the world with a 15% market share, according to DRAMeXchange's first quarter figures. Samsung leads the market with a 35% share, while Toshiba and Micron respectively control 22% and 13% of the market. While the massive acquisition will take time  to fully integrate, analysts expect the move to reduce WD's dependence on HDDs and get its sales growth back on track with 2% top line growth next year.SANDISK'S FUSION IOMEMORY FLASH DEVICES (L) AND ENTERPRISE SSDS (R). IMAGE SOURCE: SANDISK.WD's main HDD rival, Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), hasn't made a meaningful purchase in the NAND space yet. Instead, it formed a multi-year strategic alliance with Micron to expand its presence in enterprise SSDs. That plan hasn't impressed analysts, who still expect Seagate's sales to slide 3% next year.To fund the SanDisk acquisition, WD suspended its buybacks, thus reducing its EPS growth. However, the company is still expected to post 44% earnings growth next year (as SanDisk becomes earnings accretive), which makes its forward P/E of 8 look very cheap. Moreover, WD pays a forward dividend yield of 3.9%, which is still easily supported by its FCF payout ratio of 33% over the past 12 months. Like Intel, WD is a cheap dividend play instead of an aggressive bet on memory prices rising, but its SanDisk unit will still benefit from that turnaround when it happens.The bottom lineMicron would benefit much more than Intel or WD from rising memory prices, but it could also lose a lot more if that recovery is delayed. So with the market near all-time highs, I personally prefer buying cheap income-generating investments like Intel and WD over speculative turnaround plays like Micron."
3 Top High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Buy in 2017,"Dec 26, 2016 at 9:03AM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.More often than not, dividend stocks are what form the foundation of any great retirement portfolio. Not only have dividend stocks handily outperformed non-dividend-paying stocks over the long run, but they also offer a number of other advantages that income investors are bound to like.Dividend stocks pay out cash (known as the stock dividend) to shareholders each year. Because dividend stocks pay shareholders regularly, they must regularly make money too -- so most dividend stocks have proven business models. Income and stability are attractive traits in a portfolio, but the key is to buy the right dividend stocks. Here’s how.Dividend stocks also help to hedge against inevitable stock market corrections -- there have been 35 stock market corrections of at least 10% since 1950 in the S&P 500 -- and payouts can be reinvested back into more shares of stock via a Dividend Reinvestment Plan, or DRIP. Purchasing more shares of dividend-paying stock with your payout in a repeating cycle can help your nest egg quickly compound in value over time.Unfortunately, dividend stocks can also harbor a dark side. Income seekers would like the highest dividend yield possible, but they also have to ensure that a payout is sustainable. Dividend yields are a function of a stock's price, meaning a plunging stock price can dramatically lift dividend yields, making them seem attractive, at least on the surface. But, as we know, a plunging stock price could signify a business model that's in trouble. Thus, high-yield dividends, or those with yields of 4% or higher, should be heavily scrutinized by investors.The good news is there are a number of top high-yield dividends that income seekers can consider buying in 2017. Here are three to add to your list.IMAGE SOURCE: SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY.Seagate Technology PLCEarlier this year, storage solutions company Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) was a strong candidate to cut its dividend. Seagate has struggled with the transition to cloud-computing, and while it's been focusing on its next-generation solid-state drives (SSD), growth in this category hasn't been able to outpace losses in revenue from traditional hard-disk drives (HDD).However, Seagate may be in better shape than Wall Street is giving the company credit for. For instance, even though HDD revenue has fallen in each of the past four years, Wall Street could be overlooking the enormous data storage demands of big data centers. Companies are increasingly turning to the cloud and data centers to streamline their business, and that should help form a solid foundation for HDDs, even if Seagate's pricing power for HDDs is down and competition in the space is fierce.  Along those same lines, we're also seeing a strong push toward enterprise reliance. This isn't to say Seagate doesn't thrive outside of its enterprise consumers, but enterprise demand is where its greatest current growth opportunity lies in both HDD and SSD. During its fiscal first quarter report for 2017, Seagate announced that 41% of its revenue was derived from enterprise customers, which is up from 30% in the first quarter of 2015. It also shipped its highest level of HDD Exabyte capacity for any quarter over the past two years. So even though its volume of HDD units being shipped is down notable from two years ago, enterprise demand is still very much alive for HDDs.Finally, Seagate continues to do an admirable job of sharing the wealth. It's spent nearly $2.3 billion over the past nine quarters to repurchase its own common stock, and has returned nearly $1.3 billion via dividend in aggregate between fiscal 2015 and 2016. The company's current yield of 6.5% appears sustainable given the nearly $6 in free cash flow per share expected by Wall Street in 2017, making Seagate a worthwhile top high-yield dividend stock to consider.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.AbbVie Inc.Healthcare isn't exactly a sector income seekers typically flock to considering that most drug and device developers aren't profitable. Even those that are usually reinvest a substantial portion of their cash flow back into marketing and research and development. Of course, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) isn't your traditional drug company.There's little denying the prime selling point of AbbVie -- anti-inflammatory drug Humira. Of the $18.8 billion in sales AbbVie has registered through the first nine months of 2016, Humira is responsible for $11.8 billion. Currently on pace for nearly $16 billion in annual sales, Humira is the best-selling drug in the world, and it's about to turn in the best year ever for a pharmaceutical product by sales. Humira has 10 Food and Drug Administration-approved indications, and while there's concern that biosimilar competition could begin chipping away at Humira's dominance toward the end of the decade, for now it continues to deliver in a big way for AbbVie and investors.Beyond Humira, AbbVie has two key building blocks: blood cancer drug Imbruvica and its growing hepatitis C portfolio. Imbruvica is a blockbuster cancer drug acquired when AbbVie purchased Pharmacyclics in 2015. It's already generated more than $1.3 billion through nine months for AbbVie, and this doesn't even factor in that a sizable chunk of Imbruvica's revenue goes to Johnson & Johnson, which was Pharmacyclics' licensing partner on the drug.Within just the past few days, AbbVie filed a new drug application for pan-genotypic regimen of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, known as G/P for short. In clinical studies, G/P led to a sustained virologic response in 97.5% of patients who were treatment-naïve and without liver cirrhosis. When combined with Viekira, which is already on pharmacy shelves, AbbVie could have a multi-billion dollar HCV product portfolio.Sporting a 4.1% yield and a well-below-average forward P/E, AbbVie is certainly worth a closer look.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Royal Dutch Shell PLCA final top high-yield dividend stock worthy of your consideration is integrated oil and gas giant Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A)(NYSE:RDS-B).The big knock against big oil in recent years has been the precipitous drop in crude prices. Even with a steady rebound in 2016, crude is still about 50% lower than where it was three years ago, and that can take a big bite out of oil giants like Royal Dutch Shell. A smaller issue is the company's acquisition of BG Group for $53 billion, which ballooned its net debt to nearly $77 billion as of the end of the latest quarter. Even though interest rates have been low and conducive to M&A, carrying around so much debt has clearly spooked investors a bit.Now for a bit of good news: Shell's purchase of BG Group is going to transform the company in a very positive and meaningful way. BG Group has abundant natural gas and natural gas liquid assets, which instantly makes Shell one of the largest gas players in the world. Even though natural gas prices have been hit right along with crude in recent years, governments in developed countries are pushing for cleaner-burning fuels. This would imply that natural gas has a more favorable long-term outlook than coal, for example. Furthermore, the BG Group deal should boost production by 20% annually, while also giving the combined entity up to $4.5 billion in annual cost synergies. In short, we're talking about improved cash flow and margins once this deal is completely digested.Royal Dutch Shell has also done an exemplary job of controlling its costs to boost margins and preserve its 7% dividend yield, which, at one point earlier this year, looked to be in danger of being cut. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $25 billion and $30 billion in 2016 after coming in at $60 billion in 2013. By more wisely picking and choose its projects, Royal Dutch Shell is demonstrating that less can indeed be more.Assuming we've put a floor in for both crude and natural gas, Royal Dutch Shell could be a surprisingly strong income play for investors in 2017.10 stocks we like better than Royal Dutch Shell (A Shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks That Are Nothing but Dividend-Yield Traps,"Sep 20, 2016 at 2:02PM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Dividend investing is more complicated than simply choosing stocks with high dividend yields. The sustainability of those dividends is equally important. There's nothing worse for a dividend investor than seeing a company slash its dividend, a move which often sends the stock tumbling, adding salt to the wound.We asked three of our contributors to discuss a stock that could prove to be a dividend trap, luring investors with an attractive yield only to cut the payout down the road. Here's what they had to say.Don't fall for this double-digit yieldMatt DiLallo: MLP Martin Midstream Partners (NASDAQ:MMLP) currently yields an eye-popping 16.6%. That yield, however, is nothing but a trap, because the company is not generating enough cash flow to support the payout at its current level. That is causing a growing number of analysts to warn that it needs to face reality and cut the payout. Operating conditions are challenging across several of Martin Midstream Partners' operating segments. As a result, distributable cash flow fell 12.3% in the first quarter to $32.5 million. However, because the company maintained its distribution, it only generated enough cash flow to cover 98% of what it paid investors. Unfortunately, operating conditions grew even worse last quarter, and when combined with higher maintenance capital expenditures, resulted in distributable cash flow slumping 20.4% to $25.4 million. Because the company again choose to maintain its distribution, the coverage ratio sank to even more worrisome 0.76 times last quarter.Clearly, the company's payout is currently unsustainable, which has its management team ""focused on multiple initiatives to improve our leverage profile and distribution coverage ratio both near and long term."" Analysts believe that the easiest solution to both problems would be to cut the payout to a more sustainable level. Baird, for example, has Martin Midstream Partners on its list of 14 MLPs that could see their unit prices pop by cutting their distribution given the market's response to rivals that recently cut their payout. Meanwhile, FBR Capital sees Martin Midstream Partners as a potential outperformer once it cuts the distribution, which is what it is forecasting will happen.Bottom line: Don't fall for Martin Midstream's eye-catching yield because barring a significant market change or strategic catalyst, it likely will not last much longer. Hard drive bluesTim Green: Hard disk drive manufacturer Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), one of just three major players in the industry, sports a dividend yield just shy of 7%. That may seem enticing to investors, but there's a good chance that Seagate ends up being nothing more than a dividend trap.Seagate managed to produce exceptional profits from fiscal 2012 all the way through fiscal 2015. But fiscal 2016, which ended in June, was a different story. Revenue plunged to just $11.2 billion, about the same as in fiscal 2007, and the company's operating margin slumped to just 4%, down from 15% in fiscal 2015.Hard drive shipments are in decline, hurt by both a weak PC market and rapidly falling prices for solid-state drives. This fact has finally caught up with Seagate, and its profitability dropped accordingly. The company still produces plenty of cash, with about $1.1 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2016, which covers the annual dividend payments of about $750 million. But the future is clouded with uncertainty.Unless Seagate can boost its profitability in a sustainable way, a dividend cut could be in the cards. Don't be fooled by the sky-high yield.Slowing profit could mean fewer dividendsTodd Campbell: A high dividend yield only matters if dividends continue to be paid and unfortunately, I think that Computer Programs and Systems (NASDAQ:CPSI), a healthcare IT company, isn't on solid enough financial ground to keep paying the dividend for long.Computer Programs and Systems sells healthcare software to small and midsize hospitals, and while there's a lot of demand for healthcare IT solutions, this market is highly competitive and that's keeping a lid on the company's growth.In August, Computer Programs and Systems reported second-quarter sales of $68.4 million and EPS of $0.48, which were $5 million and $0.31 below what industry watchers estimated, respectively. The company cited longer-than-anticipated decision timelines and fewer add-on sales as the reasons behind its sluggish performance.The anemic results have already prompted management to cut its dividend payout by 47% to $0.34 and frankly, I'm not sure if that's the end to its dividend cuts. Computer Programs and Systems' board adopted a variable dividend policy earlier this year that limits dividends to 70% of the preceding quarter's non-GAAP earnings per share. Since Computer Programs and Systems' cash position has been weakened by past acquisitions -- the company has $155 million in short- and long-term debt and only $3.8 million in short-term cash as of June --  and business headwinds could crimp non-GAAP EPS in foreseeable future, this company's dividend payout appears to be anything but safe to me.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

7 Reasons I Bought Carbonite Inc. Stock,"Aug 26, 2016 at 8:24AM","I recently highlighted Carbonite (NASDAQ:CARB), a small-cap player in the cloud backup market, as a promising growth stock to buy in August. After doing more research, I took my own advice and started a small position in the stock. Here are my seven main reasons for doing so.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.1. It's growing in an overlooked niche marketAt first glance, the cloud backup market looks incredibly crowded. Microsoft, IBM, CA (NASDAQ:CA), EMC (NYSE:EMC), Commvault (NASDAQ:CVLT), and Symantec are the market leaders in the space, while the rest of the market is fragmented among at least a dozen other vendors.However, most of these vendors price their backup solutions for large companies, which makes their plans less economical for SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses) with fewer than 300 employees. Carbonite has carved out a niche within that market with competitive prices and features.To beef up those capabilities, Carbonite acquired Seagate Technology's (NASDAQ:STX) EVault cloud backup service for $14 million in January. That was a steal, since Seagate originally acquired the service for $185 million back in 2006. There wasn't anything technically wrong with EVault -- it's just that Seagate repeatedly failed to integrate its cloud-based features into its core hard drive business.2. Accelerating sales growthYet EVault was a natural fit for Carbonite, and the integration boosted the company's revenue considerably. Its revenue surged 57% annually to $53.4 million last quarter as bookings rose 50% to $53.7 million.That represents an acceleration from 46% sales growth in the previous quarter and 12% growth in the prior-year quarter. The company currently expects its sales to rise 41% to 48% for the full year, compared to 11% growth in 2015. CEO Mohamad Ali stated that the EVault integration was ""exceeding expectations"" and ""yielding faster and better-than-expected synergies.""3. Improving profitabilityCarbonite generated $1.2 million in GAAP net income last quarter, compared to a net loss of $4.8 million in the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP net income came in at $5.2 million, compared to a loss of $0.3 million a year ago. That bottom-line growth can be attributed to rising sales growth, the acquisition of EVault, and its GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins staying above 70%.Unlike many small tech companies, Carbonite is fairly responsible with stock-based compensation, which consumed just 4% of its revenue last quarter. Operating expenses rose 26% year over year to 68% of revenues, but that was expected due to the EVault integration.4. Rising cash flowsCarbonite also defies the stereotype of a cash-burning tech company. Its operating cash flow rose 27% annually to $5.1 million last quarter, and its adjusted free cash flow surged 128% to $7.3 million.Its cash and equivalents fell from $63.9 million at the end of 2015 to $43.2 million at the end of June, but that was mainly due to the EVault acquisition. Those healthy figures indicate that investors won't need to worry about share-diluting secondary offerings.5. Not much attention from analystsFor a company with such solid fundamentals, Carbonite doesn't get much attention from Wall Street. Six analysts cover the stock, compared to the 13 analysts that follow Commvault, 15 that follow CA, and 14 that follow EMC. Carbonite's institutional ownership of 65% is also lower than Commvault's 95%, CA's 70%, and EMC's 81%.These two facts indicate that Carbonite is still an under-the-radar stock for major investors. If the company can continue posting strong growth over the next few quarters, more analysts could start covering the stock and open the floodgates for the bigger investors.6. Surprisingly low valuationsThe analysts that cover Carbonite believe that its earnings could grow 233% this year (inflated by the EVault integration), 14% next year, and rise at an average rate of 30% for the next five years.That gives Carbonite a five-year PEG ratio of 0.9. Since a PEG ratio less than 1 is considered undervalued, the stock looks cheap relative to its earnings growth potential. Commvault, CA, and EMC respectively have PEG ratios of 4.9, 16.8, and 5.2.7. Activist involvement and buyout potentialLastly, one of Carbonite's top investors is business cloud and media company J2 Global (NASDAQ:JCOM). Its position is considered an activist one, and reportedly led to the appointment of Ali, a former HP (NYSE:HPQ) executive, as CEO in late 2014.J2 Global already tried to buy Carbonite twice -- once in 2012 and again in late 2014. The second offer, at $15 per share, still represents a 13% premium to its stock price as of this writing, and indicates that J2 Global might make another bid if Carbonite keeps growing.Should you buy Carbonite?I don't have enough faith in Carbonite to make it a core holding in my portfolio yet, but I'm willing to start a small position in this growing player in cloud storage. The numbers look promising, its niche seems defensible, and Wall Street isn't paying much attention to its growth. Investors willing to ride out the volatility that comes with lower-volume small-cap stocks should take a closer look at this stock. 10 stocks we like better than CarboniteWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The 10 Top Nasdaq 100 Dividend Stocks: Do Any Belong in Your Portfolio?,"Aug 19, 2016 at 2:02PM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Historically, the Nasdaq 100 hasn't been well-known as a habitat for dividend stocks. The tech-heavy exchange was full of companies that tended to reinvest their profits into growth projects rather than returning capital to shareholders. But in recent years, more Nasdaq-listed companies have are looking at dividends as a critical part of their total return success.Below, we examine the 10 top-yielding dividend stocks in the Nasdaq 100 today, with an eye toward identifying whether any of them give you the combination of income and growth prospects that make them ideal candidates for your portfolio.The Nasdaq 100's High Yield WinnersHere are the 10 highest-yielding stocks among the Nasdaq 100 as of Aug. 18:CompanyDividend YieldSeagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX)8%Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD)5.4%Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT)4.5%Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC)4.4%Viacom (NASDAQ:VIA) (NASDAQ:VIAB)3.7%Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)3.4%Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)3.4%Maxim Integrated Products (NASDAQ:MXIM)3.2%Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX)3.1%Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)3%DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE.The most obvious thing about this chart is the huge lead that Seagate Technology has over its Nasdaq 100 brethren. The maker of hard-disk drives and other data storage products has long been on many investors' danger lists in terms of expectations for a dividend cut in the future, especially because the company has been under considerable pressure as the mobile revolution reduces the importance of PCs, with their traditional reliance on hard drives for storage. In addition, Seagate's free cash flow has been less than its dividend payments in the first two quarters of 2016.Ordinarily, such a high yield would indeed be a danger sign. However, Seagate has actually seen its yield drop from double-digit percentages earlier this year as the stock recovered somewhat from lows below $19 a share, and optimism about the company's prospects are the primary cause. Investors were pleased by Seagate's recent restructuring announcements, and even though the company expects to reduce production of hard drives, it is looking at focusing more on high-end enterprise applications, which carry higher margins. In addition, efforts to expand its exposure to flash memory and solid-state drives could represent growth opportunities for Seagate as well. Rival Western Digital has also seen some positive movement in its share price, and although its yield also remains high, rays of hope have emerged for the data storage industry.Flying lowerAnother trend you can see in this list of stocks is that it includes many former high-flyers that have come upon tough times. In the semiconductor industry, for instance, Qualcomm and Intel are both going through the pains of adapting to changing conditions in the PC and mobile chip businesses. Cisco has seen similar changes afflict its networking hardware unit. Yet an recently improving tech sector has lifted those stocks and sent their yields lower compared to where they were early in 2016.Among the stocks above, however, there are some interesting growth candidates. Vodafone has struggled due to competitive pressure in the European wireless telecom market, but the decline in the British pound could bolster its profits due to favorable foreign-exchange impacts and help send the stock higher. Moreover, expansion efforts in emerging markets in Africa, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region could also add to growth. Even though Vodafone no longer has its exposure to the U.S. market after selling its minority stake in Verizon Wireless, the British telecom arguably has even better prospects because of the potential in many underserved emerging markets.At the same time, Paychex has exposure to the strong U.S. economy. By offering payroll services to employers, especially small and mid-sized businesses, Paychex keeps its finger on the pulse of American employment trends. As job growth has increased and the economy has recovered from the financial crisis, Paychex has been able to sustaining its own growth. With the U.S. still outpacing its peers overseas economically, Paychex offers not only an attractive yield but also plenty of possibilities for rising share prices.For dividend investors looking at the Nasdaq as a source of stock ideas, the index's traditional aversion to dividends has almost entirely disappeared. By focusing on the stocks with the best growth prospects, however, you'll ensure that you not only get paid while you wait for companies to reach their full potential but also enjoy share-price appreciation when they succeed in their growth goals. Seagate offers that mix for those who are willing to assume the execution risk of the storage-device maker's turnaround efforts, and both Vodafone and Paychex also have opportunities to expand their respective businesses to give dividend investors even more of what they want in the months and years ahead.10 stocks we like better than PaychexWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

How to Pick the Best Dividend Stocks,"Jun 27, 2016 at 8:55AM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Dividend investing is one of the most effective and time-proven strategies to obtain superior returns over the long term. However, picking the best dividend stocks is about much more than simply going after companies with high dividend yields. Investors need to take a look under the hood and analyze key aspects, such as dividend growth history and dividend sustainability going forward.Why you should invest in dividend growth stocksEarnings are subject to all kinds of corporate gimmicks and accounting manipulations; on the other hand, dividends are paid in cold, hard cash. This means that dividend payments can be considered a far more transparent measure of a company's financial health. If a company is going to reward investors with consistently growing dividends over the long term, then it needs a solid business generating increasing cash flows through all kinds of scenarios.According to statistical studies, dividends have accounted for nearly half the total return the S&P 500 index has produced over the last 30 years. Not only that, but dividend-paying stocks have considerably outperformed non-dividend stocks in the long term. Even better, companies with consistently growing dividends have beaten both companies with no dividend payments and those with stable dividends.Based on data from Ned Davis Research, from Jan. 31, 1972 to March 31, 2016, non-dividend paying stocks delivered a disappointing annual return of 2.4%. Dividend payers with no change in dividends did considerably better, with an average annual return of 7.3% over that period. Interestingly, companies with consistent dividend growth delivered an even higher return of 9.8% over the period under analysis. There is no infallible magic formula to outperform the market, but the historical evidence indicates that investing in dividend growth stocks can significantly increase your chances of obtaining market-beating returns over the long term.Buying the best dividend stocksMany dividend investors tend to put too much attention on dividend yield alone, and this can turn out to be a remarkably expensive mistake. For example, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is trading at a steaming-hot dividend yield of almost 11%; however, I would still avoid this stock like the plague.Seagate Technology is a market leader in hard disk drives, an industry going through massive challenges due to technological change and evolving consumer demand in computing. In this difficult context, Seagate Technologies reported a 23% decline in revenue during the quarter that ended on April 1, and the company lost money on a net income basis. Investors are clearly feeling the pain, since Seagate stock is down by a breathtaking 55% in the last year. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), on the other hand, is a completely different story. The company is a top player in the global snacks and nonalcoholic drinks market, where it owns 22 different brands making over $1 billion each in annual revenue across the world. This rock-solid competitive position in a stable industry has allowed PepsiCo to generate consistently growing cash flows over the years, which the company translates into dependable dividend growth for shareholders.PepsiCo has increased its dividends over the last 44 years in a row, including a 7% dividend increase for 2016. The stock is currently trading at dividend yield of 2.9%. That's quite a respectable yield coming from a company with such an impeccable track record of dividend payments, but investors can still find much higher dividend yields somewhere else. Make no mistake, though. On a total return basis, meaning dividends plus capital gains, PepsiCo stock has downright obliterated the S&P 500 index over the long term, offering a great illustration of how dividend growth stocks can be spectacularly profitable investments.PEP Total Return Price data by YChartsImportantly, investment decisions need to be made by looking at the windshield as opposed to the rearview mirror. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) doesn't have a particularly long trajectory of dividend payments, and the dividend yield is quite modest. However, Starbucks is well-positioned to deliver substantial dividend growth over the years ahead.Starbucks is one of the most remarkable success stories in the consumer sector over the last several years, and the business is clearly firing on all cylinders. Total revenue grew 9% last quarter, while net earning per share jumped 18%. The company started paying dividends in 2010, and what was a quarterly payment of $0.05 back then has rapidly increased to $0.20 per share. The last dividend increase from Starbucks was a caffeinated 23.4% hike announced in November of last year.Starbucks stock pays an unimpressive dividend yield of 1.44% at current prices; however, the dividend payout ratio is comfortably low, in the neighborhood of 42% versus earnings forecast for the current fiscal year. Chances are that Starbucks will continue delivering vigorous earnings growth in the middle term, and since the payout ratio is quite conservative, it allows a lot of room for sustained dividend increases going forward.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

3 Tech Stocks That Could Make You Rich,"Dec 7, 2016 at 7:49PM","With the market hovering near historic highs, it seems tough to find stocks with much upside potential. However, just because a stock surged over the past year doesn't mean that it will run out of steam next year. Let's take a look at three tech stocks which rallied in 2016 but might make investors even richer in 2017 -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), MeetMe (NASDAQ:MEET), and Carbonite (NASDAQ:CARB).IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.AMDAMD seemed doomed earlier this year as its stock fell below $2. Intel was crushing its CPU business, and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) was marginalizing its GPU business. But the chipmaker bounced back on the strength of its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which produced SoCs for non-PC platforms like gaming consoles, including the PS4 and Xbox One.Robust sales of those consoles helped AMD post 8% annual sales growth during its second quarter earnings in July -- marking its first quarter of positive year-over-year revenue growth in two years. It followed that up with 23% annual growth in the third quarter and a return to non-GAAP profitability.AMD is now fighting back against NVIDIA with new low-end ""VR ready"" GPUs, and its upcoming Vega chipset could challenge NVIDIA in the high-end market. It also plans to take on Intel's x86 dominance with its powerful new Zen CPUs early next year. AMD's success definitely isn't guaranteed in either market, but analysts believe that it could post 7% sales growth and a non-GAAP profit next year. If AMD can exceed those expectations, it could have much more room to run despite rallying over 220% in 2016.MeetMeMeetMe's social networking app helps users find new people to chat with. The small cap company, which acquired rival platform Skout earlier this year, had over 8.5 million monthly active users (MAUs) at the end of last quarter. That seems tiny compared to Match Group's Tinder, which has around 50 million MAUs, but MeetMe has a robust presence among millennials and is rapidly growing.MEETME. IMAGE SOURCE: GOOGLE PLAY.The app's mobile MAUs rose 32% year-over-year last quarter, and its mobile revenue soared 39% to $16 million. Total revenues, mainly generated by in-app ads, grew 20% to $17.2 million. Non-GAAP earnings rose 30% to $6.2 million, GAAP earnings surged 316% to $4.4 million, and adjusted EBITDA improved 31%.Analysts expect MeetMe's revenue and non-GAAP earnings to respectively rise 38% and 17% next year. MeetMe already advanced nearly 40% this year, but it still trades at less than 7 times earnings, compared to the average P/E of 50 for internet information providers. MeetMe's growth might eventually peak, but I believe that its stock could still double or triple from current levels if its growth stays consistent.CarboniteCarbonite offers cloud backup services for SMBs (small and medium sized businesses) with fewer than 300 employees. The cloud backup space might seem crowded, but market behemoths like Microsoft and IBM generally focus on large enterprises instead of SMBs.This enabled Carbonite -- which beefed up by acquiring Seagate's EVault cloud backup service in January -- to carve out a growing niche in the SMB market. Carbonite's revenue grew a whopping 50% annually to $51.9 million last quarter, and non-GAAP net income rose 80% to $3.8 million. The company also generated a slim GAAP net profit of $107,000, compared to a loss of nearly $6 million in the prior year quarter. Its adjusted free cash flow more than tripled to $4.5 million.Much of Carbonite's growth this year was inflated by the EVault acquisition, but analysts still expect it to post 7% sales growth and 19% earnings growth next year. Carbonite already rallied nearly 90% this year, but it still trades at 27 times forward earnings -- which remains lower than its industry average of 29.The bottom lineAMD, MeetMe, and Carbonite all crushed the market in 2016, and they could continue to do so next year. However, all three companies face clear headwinds -- AMD's efforts against Intel and NVIDIA could flop, MeetMe could be crushed by Tinder, and Carbonite could be marginalized by its larger rivals. But if they overcome those challenges, these stocks could continue soaring and make investors very happy."
What Happened in the Stock Market Today,"Oct 11, 2016 at 5:02PM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Stocks fell on Tuesday as third-quarter earnings season kicked off on a sour note. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) indexes both fell by more than a percentage point. Today's stock marketIndexPercentage ChangePoint ChangeDow(1.09%)(200.38)S&P 500(1.24%)(26.93)DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE.Most of the broadly owned exchange-traded funds declined. The United States Oil Fund ETF (NYSEMKT:USO), for example, ticked down by 1% as crude oil prices fell. Meanwhile, the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index (NYSEMKT:EEM) slipped by 2% after hitting a one-year high on the previous trading session. As for individual stocks, Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) were two of the market's biggest movers as both stocks fell following quarterly earnings updates.Illumina lowers its outlookIllumina shares lost one-quarter of their value after warning of a surprising growth slowdown ahead. In a preliminary update on its fiscal third quarter, the genetic testing equipment specialist revealed that revenue will be $607 million this quarter, which is significantly lower than the $623 million that executives forecast in late July. The scale of the miss isn't particularly bad: $607 million in revenue amounts to 10% higher sales, compared to the 12% increase executives targeted and the 11% uptick that Illumina logged in the prior quarter.However, the company explained that the shortfall came from a large drop in sales for its high-throughput sequencing instruments. These are expensive machines and even a few less orders than expected can drive big swings in Illumina's overall sales figures. Management doesn't see this dip as simply a matter of a few big contracts slipping from one period into the next, though. Instead, executives are bracing for that demand weakness to continue into the next quarter. Sales in Q4 will be ""flat to slightly up"" from Q3's $607 million result, Illumina said in a press release. Consensus estimates were looking for closer to $684 million to finish the fiscal year, and so it makes sense that the stock would fall in response to this slowdown relative to expectations.Seagate Technology hits its numbersHard drive maker Seagate fell 8% despite positive news from the company on its latest quarterly operating results. Revenue will weigh in at $2.8 billion as gross profit margin holds steady at 29% of sales this quarter, executives said as part of a preliminary quarterly earnings release. That compares to management's early August forecast of at least $2.7 billion of sales and at least a 27% profit margin. ""Our strong results reflect persistent growth and demand for cloud-based storage exabyte capacity and our new high-capacity HDD products are gaining traction in the marketplace,"" CEO Steve Luczo said in a press release. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Seagate's cost-cutting program also appears to be paying dividends by holding down growth in operating expenses. The company aims to lay off nearly 7,000 employees, which should help it achieve gross profit margin of around 30% over time. Tuesday's release shows that this target is within reach, especially since the restructuring ""continue to progress as planned,"" according to management.Overall, there's nothing in the release to suggest a weakening of Seagate's growth prospects or finances. Instead, the stock's drop seems to be more about investors taking a step back after shares surged higher in the past few months (the stock is up 84% since May). Long-term investors can ignore fluctuations like these and look forward to more details from Seagate, including an updated outlook, when its full results are published before the market opens on Oct. 19."
These Are the 10 Highest-Yielding Dividend Stocks -- but Are Their Payouts Safe?,"Oct 30, 2016 at 6:23AM","High-yielding dividend stocks are attractive to investors looking for income, and companies like CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL), Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), and Ford (NYSE:F) have some of the best dividend yields in the market right now. Yet before you simply go out and buy the 10 highest-yielding dividend stocks listed below, you owe it to yourself to consider whether the companies on that list are likely to stay there. Below, we'll take a closer look at some of these dividend stocks to see which ones deserve more of your attention.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The top 10 yields in the S&P 500Here are the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the S&P 500 as of Oct. 28:StockDividend YieldFrontier Communications10.2%CenturyLink7.6%Seagate Technology7.4%HCP6.5%Staples6.4%Iron Mountain5.7%AT&T (NYSE:T)5.3%Host Hotels (NYSE:HST)5.2%Ford5.1%ONEOK5%DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE.The most important thing to think about is that this list already looks different than it did just a few months ago. Recently, Williams Companies cut its dividend in the wake of its stalled merger plans, and what had been a double-digit dividend yield has now sunk below the 3% mark. That's not an uncommon phenomenon with high-yield dividend stocks, and investors must be vigilant to avoid getting stuck in a dividend trap.Getting paid to take on riskMeanwhile, you'll notice that the 10 stocks on the list fall into a couple of broad categories. The most obvious is that the telecom industry is well-represented, with Frontier, CenturyLink, and AT&T making the list. Telecoms often have high dividend yields because they're able to generate large amounts of cash flow from their fixed assets, with immense initial capital investment in their respective networks gradually paying off from the revenue that customers' monthly bills generate for the companies. In some cases, those above-average yields reflect concerns about the long-term viability of their business strategies, and the increasingly competitive conditions in the industry make investing in telecom even riskier. That's likely one reason why CenturyLink is looking closely at a potential merger of equals with Level 3 Communications, in an effort to bring both telecom services and infrastructure assets into a single company and provide more appealing products to valuable business customers. Yet with Level 3 currently paying no dividend, it seems unlikely that a post-merger combined company would be able to sustain the same dividend yield over a broader investor base. Strategies like the one AT&T is using to concentrate on wireless expansion seem more conducive to growth in a way that won't necessary jeopardize dividends.Several other stocks on the list are going through some transitions. Seagate is working hard to go beyond its legacy hard-disk drive business to keep up with the pace of innovation, and its yield has fallen dramatically in the past several months simply because its stock price has soared. Staples, meanwhile, has had to deal with its attempted merger with Office Depot getting derailed, and it is still working to convince investors that an independent strategy could be viable in the long run. Even Ford is facing pressure, with recent record sales activity starting to give way to what many see as the next cyclical downturn for the industry. That has put pressure on its stock, but it has also led to some delivery slowdowns that could hurt earnings in the future.Are REITs the answer?One place that dividend investors have turned lately for higher yields is the real estate investment trust market. REITs are required to pay out the bulk of their income as distributions, and that produces some impressive yields. HCP and Host Hotels are both structured as REITs, and they've attracted many income investors with their payout levels.However, it's important not to take REIT payouts for granted. Host Hotels, for instance, gradually built up its quarterly payments from $0.01 per share in the aftermath of the financial crisis to $0.26 per share in late 2014. But immediately thereafter, the company reined in its quarterly payouts to $0.20 per share and has kept them locked there ever since. Yet as strong as that growth seems, it only returned Host Hotels to roughly the distribution amounts it was making in 2008 prior to the crisis, showing the vulnerability of REIT dividends to changing conditions that affect income. HCP has been more dependable, with annual increases stretching back for decades, but even it might have to make dividend reductions in the wake of its spinoff of Quality Care Properties.The unsatisfying answer for dividend investors is that the highest-yielding dividend stocks are never entirely safe as far as being able to sustain their payouts forever. The track record of stocks on this list is mixed, but several of them have had to make dividend cuts in the past, and others are likely to do so in the future. By weighing the risk of dividend cuts against the benefit of high income now, you can make your own judgment call about whether the potential rewards of high-yield dividend investing are worth it for you."
10 Highest Dividend Yielding Stocks,"Sep 9, 2016 at 7:28AM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.It's no secret that dividend-yielding stocks are the cornerstones of a solid retirement portfolio. Usually, such stocks represent ownership in stalwart businesses that pay shareholders on a quarterly basis. Those payments not only offer downside protection, but they can also compound returns over time.Still, one of the dangers of dividend investing is chasing after high yields. Case in point: The 10 stocks listed below have the highest yields of all the companies in the S&P 500, but not all of them are worth your investing dollars. In many cases, there's a good reason such stocks have high yields -- because there's a lot of risk involved.CompanyDividend YieldFrontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR)9.2%CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL)7.7%Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX)7.4%HCP, Inc. 5.9%Staples 5.6%ONEOK5.1%Iron Mountain 5%Ford (NYSE:F)4.8%General Motors4.7%AT&T 4.7%DATA SOURCES: FINVIZ.COM, YAHOO! FINANCE.If you're a dividend investor, there's nothing more important than free cash flow (FCF). This represents the amount of money a company was able to put in its pocket at the end of the year, minus capital expenditures. It is from FCF that dividends are paid, and investors should generally aim for companies that use less than 85% of their FCF to pay dividends.Here's how the companies above stack up in FCF payouts.There are sometimes reasonable explanations for a company having a high payout ratio. Frontier, for instance, has made some huge acquisitions that have yet to pay off fully, and its cash flow is far greater than its GAAP earnings. But we're in search of the best high-yielding stocks of the bunch, so we'll eliminate Frontier, Staples, ONEOK, and Iron Mountain right off the bat.Business momentumBeyond just paying a dividend, it's important to take note of whether or not the long-term thesis for investing in these companies is intact. Sometimes, a low payout ratio can hide a declining business that has strong FCF for the time being -- but is in long-term decline.Ideally, we should see companies that are increasing revenue by at least 2% per year to outpace inflation, over a two-to-three-year time frame. Of the remaining companies, here's how they have performed in terms of revenue growth.CenturyLink, a regional telecom, and Seagate, a provider of data storage devices, are both in long-term declines. The former is losing out to much larger national players while the latter is seeing its business be commoditized. General Motors, on the other hand, just hasn't shown the same type of growth that rival Ford has.And then there were three...That leaves us with three high-yielding dividends from the S&P 500 that are worth investigating.For Ford, the main thing holding the stock back -- and the yield up so high -- is the fact that investors are worried we're on the brink of a downturn in car-buying behavior. This is a very cyclical industry, as everyone tends to upgrade to new cars at the same time -- when the economic winds are encouraging. That's been the case for a while now. If you're willing to wait out a downturn -- or you believe there's still room for revenue to grow globally -- then this may be a stock for you.AT&T, on the other hand, benefits from huge market share in terms of mobile market share in America, as well as a smaller share in providing Internet services. The recent purchase of DirecTV also gives the company a hand in the content-delivery game. The barriers to entry are relatively high in the telecom industry, offering protection for investors. While the dividend is unlikely to grow by leaps and bounds, investors interested in a big payout would do well to investigate AT&T.Finally, we have HCP, a real-estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses on healthcare properties. Obviously, with rising healthcare costs and a generation of Baby Boomers set to retire, there's a lot of potential growth for HCP. The company will be spinning off its post-acute care and skilled-nursing facilities portfolio in the near future, but the remaining company will still have lots of opportunity for growth.Remember, not every high yield is worth chasing, but in the case of these three dividends, it might be worth buying shares for your retirement portfolio.10 stocks we like better than FordWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

10 Highest Dividend Yielding Stocks,"Dec 31, 2016 at 1:08PM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Click here to see our latest dividend-paying stock picks.One sound long-term investing strategy is to buy stocks that offer up high dividend yields. This strategy has become particularly enticing in today's low interest rate environment since it offers investors a chance to generate a lot of income from their portfolios. However, just because a stock offers up a high yield doesn't make it an automatic buy, especially since sky-high yields are often accompanied by sky-high risks. Knowing that, lets take a look at the 10 highest-yielding stocks from the S&P 500 to see if any of them are worth buying today.  For simplicity's sake, we'll exclude all real estate investments trusts, or REITs, from this article since they play by their own set of rules.CompanyTickerDividend YieldFrontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR)12.3%CenturyLink(NYSE:CTL)9%Seagate Technology(NASDAQ:STX)6.4%Mattel(NASDAQ:MAT)5.4%Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS)5.2%Ford(NYSE:F)4.8%Pitney Bowes(NYSE:PBI)4.8%Entergy Corp.(NYSE:ETR)4.8%FirstEnergy (NYSE:FE)4.6%AT&T(NYSE:T)4.6%DATA SOURCES: FINVIZIs the payout sustainable?Most dividend investors know that a key metric for any dividend stock is the payout ratio, which is the percentage of a company's earnings that it uses to pay dividends. In general, a payout ratio over 85% is worrisome as it hints that the dividend could be on the chopping block if the company's earnings ever take a hit. A payout ratio greater than 100% means that the company is paying out more in dividends than it generates in net income.Here's a look at the current payout ratio for each of these companies.CompanyPayout ratioFrontier Communications N/ACenturyLink127%Seagate Technology200%Mattel144%Staples 54%Ford 33%Pitney Bowes56%Entergy Corp.48%FirstEnergy51%AT&T82%DATA SOURCES: YAHOO! FINANCERight away we can see that this metric removes several companies from contention. Frontier Communications isn't expected to be profitable this year, which is why it doesn't even have a payout ratio. That makes it an easy pass in my book.CenturyLink, Seagate Technology, and Mattel all boast payout ratios well over 100%, which means their dividend payments currently exceeds their net income. That lets us remove them from consideration, too.Just like that, our list of 10 has been cut down do 6.Is the business growing?The remaining companies all appear to offer up stable dividend payments, but even dividend investors also need to think about growth. After all, if a company's profits are stagnant or declining, its dividend isn't likely to be increased over time, making it a far less attractive investment.Let's take a look at the projected profit growth rates of our remaining list of companies to see what analysts believe is going to happen over the next five years. CompanyEstimated 5 year growth ratesStaples 1.3%Ford 1.5%Pitney Bowes4%Entergy Corp.(8.2%)FirstEnergy(5.1%)AT&T8.4%DATA SOURCES: FINVIZ.While Entergy and FirstEnergy are profitable and paying out solid dividends, Wall Street believes that both of these companies are about to see their profits head in the wrong direction. Those numbers tell me that we should look elsewhere for investment opportunities.Staples is another company that should give investors pause. The company's business model is under attack from e-commerce companies like Amazon.com, which is a big reason why same store sales numbers have been in decline. To fight back, the company is closing down its under-performing stores and investing heavily in Staples.com, but those moves are going to take their toll on the company's profitability.The markets also appear to be quite concerned with Ford's long-term prospects. That's likely owing to worries about peaking auto sales in North America -- a theory which, if true, suggest that the company's sales and profit margins are currently unsustainable. In addition, autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing services are both long-term opportunities and threats to the auto industry. Given those realities, it's not hard to understand why analysts are being cautions with their growth estimates.For these reasons, conservative investors might want to consider removing both Ford and Staples from contention, too.And then there were twoPitney Bowes sailed through our first two tests with ease, but that doesn't mean that this is a risk-free stock. In fact, the markets have been punishing shareholders for more than two years as the company has been struggling with growth. Last quarter the company's earnings fell by more than 22% due to lower-than-expected license revenue, which is one of the company's most lucrative business lines. That caused the company to reign in its full year profit forecast. That's a troubling development that could suggest that analysts are over estimating this company's growth prospects.AT&T, on the other hand, has a lot going for it. The company's wireless division continues to be a cash cow that is supporting by very low churn rates. AT&T also offers investors the potential for growth thanks to its recent purchase of DirecTV. Its pending merger with Time Warner could also be a big win for shareholders if it goes through. . Even if the deal falls through, AT&T should still be able to crank out consistent earnings growth, allowing it to retain its status as a dividend aristocrat.So there you have it. This simple list of criteria shows that income investors would be wise to add AT&T to their watch list and largely ignore the rest. "
10 Highest Dividend Stocks on the S&P 500 -- Are Any Worth Buying?,"Sep 29, 2016 at 7:21AM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The average stock on the S&P 500 index pays a dividend yield of 2.41%, but some are paying much more. Here's a chart of the 10 highest-paying dividend stocks on the S&P 500, and which ones might be the best choices to buy and hold for the long term.CompanyStock SymbolDividend YieldFrontier CommunicationsFTR9.70%CenturyLinkCTL7.82%Seagate TechnologySTX6.92%HCP, Inc.HCP5.91%StaplesSPLS5.61%Iron MountainIRM5.18%CF Industries HoldingsCF5.17%ONEOKOKE4.96%Ford Motor CompanyF4.93%Host Hotels and ResortsHST4.90%DIVIDEND YIELDS CURRENT AS OF 9/23/2016.The three best buysBefore moving on, it's important to mention that a high dividend doesn't necessarily translate into a good stock to invest in. For example, Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR), the highest-paying company in the S&P 500, has struggled to turn a profit for several years now. In my opinion, it's at serious risk of a dividend cut in the near future.With that in mind, there are a few stocks on this list worth buying. Here are my three favorites in no particular order.1. HCP, Inc.HCP, Inc. (NYSE:HCP) is one of the largest real estate investment trusts (REITs) specializing in healthcare properties. The company has a dividend yield of nearly 6% as of this writing, and an impressive 31-year streak of increasing its payout.At the moment, HCP's portfolio is a mix of senior housing properties (40%), post-acute/skilled nursing facilities (26%), life science (15%), medical offices (14%), and hospital properties (5%). However, after some less-than-stellar performance from its post-acute/skilled nursing assets, the company has decided to split them off into a newly created REIT that will be called QCP.Here's a thorough discussion of the pending spinoff, but in a nutshell, the remaining HCP portfolio will have a much higher overall quality, which will lead to the stability investors love, as well as greater financial flexibility. And the spun-off assets will be in a company whose sole focus is maximizing their value. QCP will have strategies at its disposal that are either impractical, or unavailable, while still under the umbrella of HCP.2. Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM)Also a REIT, Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) owns and operates specialized storage facilities, and provides information protection, storage, and record management services. As of this writing, Iron Mountain has an impressive real estate portfolio consisting of 1,100 facilities located in 41 countries. In fact, the company has such a widespread presence that 94% of the Fortune 1000 are Iron Mountain customers.Storage facilities, while they may sound like a boring business, can be one of the most exciting types of real estate from a business standpoint. They have low maintenance expenses and turnover costs, and tenant retention is generally higher than other types of properties. In fact, Iron Mountain's gross profit margin is 76.6%.As far as the dividend is concerned, Iron Mountain's 26 consecutive years of revenue growth should help set your mind at ease. The company is currently in the midst of a pretty ambitious expansion plan, known as the ""2020 vision,"" and if successful, Iron Mountain projects its dividend in 2020 will be $2.54 per share. Not only would that represent a 31% increase over the current payout, but the company actually predicts that they will need to spend less of its AFFO and utilize less leverage to make it happen.3. Ford Motor Co.I see Ford (NYSE:F) as the riskiest stock out of the three that I'm discussing here, but it also has tremendous upside potential if the company's sales remain strong. The automotive business is a highly cyclical one, and even Ford has acknowledged that a downturn is entirely possible in the not-too-distant future.Investors are worrying that the current business cycle has peaked, and this is the primary reason why shares trade for an absurdly low valuation of just 5.4 times trailing 12-month (TTM) earnings. However, Ford CFO Bob Shanks assured investors that it plans to offer a ""secure regular dividend"" through the entire business cycle, and even mentioned the plan to pay a supplemental cash dividend when cash flow allows.The bottom line is that Ford's 4.9% dividend is safe. The company is doing a great job with capital allocation, and the $20 billion in cash on the balance sheet makes me even more confident in Ford's dividend commitment. And once sales begin to rise again, the shares have a great deal of upside potential.The bottom lineThere are some high-paying stocks on the S&P 500, but they aren't all worth owning right now. However, the three stocks discussed here offer sustainable income in addition to the possibility of market-beating growth over the long run. Any of these three would be an excellent addition to a retirement or income investing strategy.The $16,122 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlookIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $16,122 more... each year!

5 Best Performing Stocks in September,"Oct 3, 2016 at 1:30PM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.In September 2016, two classes of stocks outperformed everything else by a wide margin. Partly thanks to surging oil prices, three of the S&P 500's top five performers that month came from the energy industry. The other two tickers in that elite quintet were hard-drive builders, lifted by a rebounding market for PC systems.Let's have a closer look at September's best performers.APA DATA BY YCHARTSIn a series of jumps and drops, the price of crude oil rose more than 8% last month. The tide of global political pressure turned as the OPEC consortium agreed to cut production by 1.5 million barrels per day. A rising tide lifts all boats, and oil stocks were generally very kind to their owners in September. For major independent oil producer Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), this was the main story behind September's rising share prices.But wait -- there's more.On top of that strong foundation, Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA) announced the discovery of a newly discovered 3 billion-barrel reserve of shale oil. Apache's stock rose 7% on that finding alone.And for Spectra Energy, oil prices hardly even mattered. Here, the big boost arrived when fellow energy pipeline operator Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) announced an all-stock merger with Spectra to create a titan of the energy midstream industry.After several months of plunging oil prices, the energy sector is thirsty for a serious rebound. Many smaller companies have found merger partners to stave off a bitter end -- or gone out of business altogether. Weak balance sheets are being put to the ultimate test here, and the sector is consolidating in response.Signs of life in PCsMeanwhile, in the computer hardware corner, rumors of the PC's death turned out to be greatly exaggerated.Storage giant Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) got the ball rolling in early September. That's when the company raised its first-quarter guidance, reflecting two positive trends: the integration with recently acquired peer SanDisk that's running ahead of schedule -- and a PC industry that's showing signs of recovery.That announcement lifted Western Digital shares 13% higher overnight, and the stock has held steady at this elevated level.Arch rival Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) took a smaller step up that day but followed up with another surge as private-equity firm ValueAct Capital invested more than $400 million in the company. ValueAct is now one of Seagate's largest shareholders, holding 4% of the company's shares. The firm explained its investment with a desire to take advantage of ""attractive long-term secular trends"" around Seagate's business.Other technology businesses and independent market watchers have only amplified the message found in Western Digital's tea leaves. The PC market seems is not quite dead yet, and it seems ready to stick around for a while.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

4 Cybersecurity Stats That Will Blow You Away,"Nov 13, 2016 at 11:28AM","The global cybersecurity market could grow from $122.45 billion today to $202.36 billion by 2021, according to a new report from Research and Markets. The firm believes that growth will be driven by an increase of connected objects across the Internet of Things, relaxed BYOD (bring your own device) policies at work, and the need for tighter application security.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.It also estimates that the banking, financial services, and insurance market vertical will experience the highest growth due to the rising adoption of web and mobile apps, and that the Asia Pacific region will experience the highest growth as growing markets like China and India deploy more cybersecurity solutions.That forecast sounds bullish, but investors should also examine these four other stats to understand how rapidly the cybersecurity market could grow within the next few years.Stat number oneNearly 178 million personal records were exposed in data breaches in 2015, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center. Nearly 70% of those breaches occurred in the healthcare sector, and almost 20% occurred at government/military agencies.These organizations will likely increase their cybersecurity budgets considerably in the near future, which means more business for ""best in breed"" perimeter defense companies like FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW). FireEye's threat prevention platform identifies incoming threats before they strike, and Palo Alto's next-gen firewalls prevent them from reaching internal networks.Larger companies with bundled security solutions -- like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) -- will also likely see stronger demand for their security appliances and services.Stat number twoThe global cost of handling cyberattacks is expected to rise from $400 billion in 2015 to $2.1 trillion by 2019, according to estimates from Lloyd's and Juniper Research. That includes direct damage as well as post-attack disruptions. Payroll giant ADP, hard drive maker Seagate, the FBI, the IRS, and the Department of Homeland Security -- which were all struck by data breaches this year -- all know how costly these attacks can be.While larger companies and organizations are gradually responding to these threats, Cisco's 2016 Annual Security Report found that just 29% of small to medium-sized businesses used basic security tools like configuration and patching to prevent breaches -- down from 39% in 2014.Stat number threeDespite that apparent complacence, 52% of respondents in CyberEdge Group's 2015 Cyberthreat Defense Report believed that their companies would be hit by successful cyberattacks within the year. That fear is certainly justified -- Symantec, best known to consumers as the maker of Norton Antivirus, recently discovered that three quarters of all websites had exploitable vulnerabilities.Companies like Symantec are also evolving into ""all-in-one"" guardians for these businesses and organizations. Symantec recently acquired security firm Blue Coat to add its network and cloud protection services to its core portfolio of security solutions for PCs, data centers, and emails. That move makes it an ""end-to-end"" security provider which offers ""layers"" or protection, which previously required services from multiple vendors.Stat number four43% of data breaches were caused internally, according to a report from Intel Security last September. Half of those breaches were accidental, caused by poor security practices, while the other half were intentional -- caused by disgruntled employees and malicious insiders.Although internal data breaches are rising, most cybersecurity companies only focus on external threats with firewalls and threat prevention systems. The standout performer in the internal data breach market is CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR), the market leader in PAM (privileged account management) solutions. CyberArk's platform locks down compromised systems and quarantines internal threats before they can spread to other parts of the network.The key takeawayInvesting in most cybersecurity stocks today isn't for queasy investors, since many of these high-growth players have high valuations, low profits, and are prone to wild price swings. However, less risk-averse investors should still keep one or two cybersecurity stocks in their long term portfolio since the market still remains ripe for long-term growth and consolidation."
Growth Stock Investing: The 3 Worst Mistakes You Can Make,"Nov 25, 2016 at 12:20PM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.According to a study conducted by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch over a 90-year period, both growth stocks and value stocks have delivered double-digit returns for investors. Based on the data, growth stocks are up an average of 12.6% annually since 1926, while value stocks have jumped 17% annually in value.  On the surface, it would appear as if value investing is the way to go, but since the end of the Great Recession, growth stocks have widely outperformed value stocks, probably a result of the Federal Reserve's dovish monetary policy that's allowed for cheap access to capital. But, just because growth stock investing has led to double-digit returns over the past nine decades doesn't mean a profit is guaranteed. We asked three of our Foolish contributors to weigh in on what they believed to be the worst investing mistake you could make when investing in growth stocks. Here's what they had to say. Chasing growth stocks before an industry is establishedSean Williams: I believe the biggest concern with growth stock investing is that investors have a habit of chasing new technology before it's had an opportunity to establish itself.Perhaps the best case in point is the 3D printing industry. We only need to pull up a 10-year chart of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) to get an up close look at how rapidly their valuation inflated and deflated over just a few short years.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.On paper, the 3D printing industry looks like a solid growth story -- and for many years, it was. Between 2009 and 2014, 3D Systems' revenue almost sextupled to $653.7 million, while Stratasys' revenue rose more than sevenfold to $750 million. The potential for 3D printing seemed to be without bounds. It could presumably be used to create prototypes to speed up the innovative process for industrial companies, while saving money in the process since companies wouldn't be forced to buy prototypes in bulk. 3D printing also has intriguing medical applications, with the possibility that 3D printers could create transplantable organs, or other devices. Nearly every industry had a presumed purpose for 3D printers -- and yet the bubble burst for both 3D Systems and Stratasys.Why? The fundamental answer you'll hear from the companies themselves and Wall Street pundits is that corporate spending slowed, thus hurting new orders. But there's more to it than that.To begin with, both 3D Systems and Stratasys had acquired companies at a breakneck pace for years. While M&A is a great strategy to pack on top-line growth, it can take time for businesses to mesh and synergies to be realized. The recent slowdown in top-line growth, which has also been attributed to poor product rollout execution, could be rightly blamed on 3D Systems and Stratasys trying to gel too many of their purchased components at once.More importantly, growth investors never gave either business a chance to develop an identity. They just saw big flashy numbers surrounding 3D printers and dove in feet first despite the water being ice cold. While waiting for an industry to establish itself sometimes means missing out on an initial surge in share price, it also means investing in companies that could be far less likely to swan-dive like 3D Systems and Stratasys have.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Easier said than doneDaniel Miller: Investing in growth stocks isn't for the faint of heart, as the swings in price can be huge. And while there's plenty of important things to watch -- such as how leveraged the young company's balance sheet is, or how much cash it's burning through annually -- arguably the most important thing should be the simplest: controlling your emotions.That's important because growth stocks make wild and abrupt swings in stock price, and if you're constantly refreshing the price on Yahoo! Finance, it's going to be difficult to stay invested for the long haul – and that's what you want to do with winning growth stocks.That's especially true because picking a winning growth stock for the long haul means you'll likely be holding this for a decade, or hopefully forever, and will see many cycles of the stock market. That means some dips will be devastating, even if the company's underlying business thesis is still very much intact.Perhaps the difficult aspect of ""controlling your emotions"" is actually on the flip side of the coin: selling too early! If you do pick a winning growth stock and it doubles, quadruples, or something even more jaw-dropping, it can become tough to hold on rather than cashing out and redistributing those funds to other new ideas -- take this $802,179 mistake to heart.My advice to help control emotions is to make a detailed checklist and investing thesis for your growth stocks -- or all of your stocks, really. Looking at one quarterly report compared to the prior-year result doesn't provide context, it merely incentives short-sighted reactions. Keep track of the balance sheet, revenue growth, margins, and cash burn every quarter over the long term, and let that tell the story, rather than knee-jerk reactions to a bad quarter or fear during a recession. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Growth stocks or otherwise, this mistake will hurt youJason Hall: In my experience, one of the biggest mistakes people make when investing is the same, whether it's growth stocks or otherwise: not really understanding what they own. The sad fact is, too many investors buy a stock based on an idea, tip, or reading the name in an article, but they don't actually take any further steps to investigate the company, industry, or competitors, or do any other due diligence before putting their money on the line.And frankly, this is a key thing that drives the two huge mistakes my fellow contributors write about. If you don't invest any time to learn about what you own, you leave yourself exposed to letting your emotions take control of your investing decisions, as Dan wrote about, or running out of patience if you don't know how things are playing out with the bigger picture, as Sean discussed. Bottom line: The root cause of these kinds of investing mistakes is often failing to put in the necessary time to know what you're actually investing in. "
"Why Mirati Therapeutics, Inc.'s Shares Are Being Obliterated Today","Jun 6, 2016 at 12:16PM","What: Investors in Mirati Therapeutics (NASDAQ:MRTX) are having a rough start to the week. The clinical-stage biotech's stock is down more than 40% as of 11:30 a.m. EDT after management shared a few clinical updates that caused some investors to worry.So what: Mirati Therapeutics provided updates on three of its ongoing clinical programs, but traders appear to be focused on news related to its phase 1b glesatinib dose expansion study. Glesatinib is being researched as a potential treatment for two very specific types of non-small cell lung cancer.During the trial, glesatinib was able to produce tumor regression in 10 out of the 11 patients who used the therapy, which was an encouraging result. Unfortunately, nine of those 11 patients experienced bioavailability and tolerability issues from the treatment, resulting in the need to interrupt their therapy and lower their dose. To help address these tolerability issues, Mirati has confirmed that it will be using a new formulation of glesatinib in their phase 2 study. Management believes that this new formulation has a good chance at fixing those exposure and tolerability issues.However, not everybody is convinced that the new formulation is a slam dunk, and at least one analyst has already tempered his enthusiasm for the company's shares. Leerink Partners analyst Michael Schmidt downgraded Mirati Therapeutics shares today to market perform and lowered his price target from $37 to $20, saying, ""Our new PT of $20 (from $37) reflects a lower probability of success for glesatinib, as well as reduced market assumptions to account for potential added competition.""The increased uncertainty about glesatinib's future mixed with the analyst downgrade are weighing heavily on the company's shares today. Now what: Despite the setback, Mirati Therapeutics CEO Charles Baum offered investors encouraging words about this new formulation by saying:We believe that the combination of improved tolerability and bioavailability of the new formulation will allow patients to remain on the intended dose, extend the duration of treatment and possibly increase response rates.  Because development of the new formulation was already in process for integration into the Phase 2 trial for use commercially, the change has already been discussed with the FDA and is moving forward.While it was great to see that glesatinib was able to produce tumor regression in the majority of patients tested, being forced to change the drug's formulation does add an additional element of risk to an already risky stock. For that reason, investors might want to stay on the sidelines until the company shares additional data on how well its new formulation is performing before they consider this sell-off a buying opportunity.10 stocks we like better than Mirati Therapeutics, Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Cott Corporation Stock Jumped 10%,"Aug 4, 2016 at 8:01PM","What: Beverage company Cott Corporation's (NYSE:COT) stock jumped as much as 10.8% on Thursday, after the company announced second-quarter results and the acquisition of S&D Coffee and Tea.

These figures compare to Cott's $780 million in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $0.18 in the year-ago quarter.Analyst estimates were in line with results. On average, analysts expected Cott to report revenue of $766 million and adjusted EPS of $0.15.One of the most positive takeaways from the quarter was Cott's higher gross profit margin. For the quarter, Cott's gross profit margin was 33% -- up from 30.9% in the year-ago quarter.Cott management confirmed the company ""entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement to acquire S&D Coffee,"" a premium coffee roaster and provider of customized coffee, tea, and extract solutions.""The acquisition of S&D is in line with Cott's strategy of focusing on acquiring cash accretive businesses with higher growth while continuing Cott's beverage diversification outside of carbonated soft drinks, shelf stable juices, and large format retail,"" the company said in a press release.Now what: Looking forward, management believes its recent acquisitions can help the company generate between $395 to $435 million in operating cash flow in 2019.

Why Theravance Biopharma Inc Shares Tumbled 19.5% Today,"Oct 27, 2016 at 5:18PM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.What happenedAfter reporting that it's raising capital via a stock and debt offering, Theravance Biopharma (NASDAQ:TBPH) shares fell 19.5% today.So whatTheravance Biopharma is offering $100 million of its ordinary shares and $150 million aggregate principal of convertible senior notes due in 2023. Theravance Biopharma plans to grant the stock offering underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to $15.0 million of additional ordinary shares, and the convertible offering underwriters will get a 30-day option to purchase up to $22.5 million principal amount of additional notes.Money raised from the offerings, minus fees and expenses, will land on Theravance Biopharma's balance sheet to be used to fund its general corporate activities, including the ongoing development of its COPD drug TD-4208, which it's co-developing with Mylan (NASDAQ: MYL).Now whatMylan paid Theravance Biopharma $15 million up front and agreed to pay up to $220 million in potential milestone payments on TD-4208 in 2015, and recently, the company has reported positive phase 3 efficacy from two TD-4208 trials. At the time the deal was struck, Mylan also paid $30 million to buy shares in Theravance Biopharma at a price of $18.92 per share. TD-4208 is a once-daily, long-acting COPD drug that's dosed via the mist of a nebulizer, rather than via a handheld device. Theravance has previously indicated it believes TD-4208 could help as many as 9% of the 12.7 million American suffering from COPD. Although results from TD-4208's late-stage trials were positive, the companies won't file for FDA approval until results are available from a separate late-stage safety study. Those results are expected next year. Assuming they're good, an FDA filing for approval could come shortly thereafter. Given that the market for COPD therapies values out north of billion-dollar blockbuster territory, investors will want to pay close attention to the company's progress next year.10 stocks we like better than Theravance BiopharmaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

HP Inc's Plan to Address Printer Woes Taking Shape,"Oct 5, 2016 at 10:21AM","The good news is HP (NYSE:HP) stock is up 8% since announcing a surprisingly strong fiscal 2016 third quarter on Aug. 24. The not-so-good news is that HP shares would have really skyrocketed had it not been for its lagging printer division.Consumer printing-related sales took it on the chin last quarter, as did HP's supplies segment. What really hurts is that before taxes, printing generates the majority of HP's earnings from continuing operations. Needless to say, CEO Dion Weisler and team have some work to do, but a few of HP's recent moves could be just what the doctor ordered.Phase one of the planHP's saving grace last quarter were strong PC sales. Notebook sales were particularly robust and helped HP narrow the global PC sales gap with China-based Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY) from nearly two percentage points in the second calendar quarter of 2015, to a mere four-tenths of one percentage point this year.The 12% jump in notebook units sold led to the PC unit's 4% overall improvement, despite a 6% drop in desktop sales. Notebook's delivered a 12% gain in revenue sequentially, and 8% year over year, which was the catalyst for its ever-so-slight increase in total sales to $7.51 billion compared to a year-ago $7.5 billion.As impressive as HP's personal systems unit performed last quarter -- operating margins also soared to 4.4%, up from just 2.8% in 2015 -- it was how the division was able to engineer such strong results that will be the impetus for Weisler and team to turn around that ""other"" division.HP's focus on notebooks targeting the world's mobile consumer and its recently released virtual reality (VR) ready PC OMEN specifically designed for gamers are ideal examples of its master plan. HP isn't trying to be all PC things to all people: It's carving out niches within the broader market. And based on several recent moves, it's clear HP intends to replicate that plan to jump-start printer sales.IMAGE SOURCE: HP.Phase two is under wayThe recent $1.05 billion deal for Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) printing division is one example of HP's strategy. The largest printing-related acquisition in HP's history was highlighted as notable for a number of reasons, but a few stand out.One, folding Samsung's ""formidable portfolio"" of printers and copiers utilizing multifunction printing technologies (MFPs) gives HP customers what is essentially an all-in-one alternative, including secure cloud-based functionality. Second, the new MFPs, as per HP, will come with as few as seven replaceable parts, which translates to increased efficiency and lower cost of ownership.Finally, the Samsung deal also includes ""more than 6,500"" printing patents, which will facilitate further innovations, along with a bevy of printing supplies and accessories. Supplies were HP's second largest source of revenue last quarter, behind only notebooks, so its 18% sales nosedive last quarter really stung.Another example of HP's printing strategy of targeting specific needs and markets is its recently released Sprocket photo printer. At about the size of a smartphone, Sprocket won't replace a home or office printer. Sprocket is for the social media and smartphone camera-happy consumers who, according to one estimate, will snap 2.5 trillion pictures this year.At an introductory price of $129 Sprocket sales aren't likely to pad HP's revenue coffers much. However, the trillions of pictures taken -- the majority of which will be via smartphone -- will require not only a Sprocket to print and share, but also ink, paper, and any future accessories. Much the way Telecoms subsidize smartphone costs to push data plans, Sprocket could turn out to be a means to Weisler's end: boosting supply sales.There's also the opportunity 3D printing offers -- a market estimated to reach $30 billion in five years -- high-end enterprise printer-copier solutions primarily to drive supply revenue, and the rapid global adoption of PrintOS for HP's print service providers included in Weisler's strategy. The plan to reinvigorate printing is taking shape, and if it takes hold, HP's nice stock price run of late will be just the beginning. "
3 of the Worst IPOs of 2016 (and Why You Should Consider 2 of Them!),"Dec 10, 2016 at 8:26AM","IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL.Initial public offerings (IPOs) -- when a company launches its shares on the public markets -- always generate interest: They're the new blood of the equity market. With the final month of the year under way, it's a good time to look back at some of the listings of 2016. Specifically, the table below shows three of the four worst-performing IPOs of the year (from their opening price). Don't be put off by ""worst-performing"": Past performance is not indicative of future results. In fact, among the three stocks, two are interesting ideas, one of which I believe is actionable now and could generate healthy returns next year and for many years thereafter. (Spoiler for the impatient reader: It's lubricant manufacturer and retailer Valvoline Inc (NYSE:VVV).)CompanyMarket Capitalization*IndustryReturn From IPO Opening Price (Through Dec. 7)Valvoline Inc$4.1 billionCommodity Chemicals(16%)ZTO Express Inc (ADR) (NYSE:ZTO)$9.9 billionAir Freight and Logistics(26.3%)NantHealth Inc (NASDAQ:NH)$1.2 billionHealth Care Technology(38.5%)*SEARCH WAS LIMITED TO COMPANIES WITH A CURRENT MARKET CAPITALIZATION ABOVE $1 BILLION. DATA SOURCE: BLOOMBERG.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.NantHealth Inc: Unsuitable for anything but a crap shootUnless you have a background in the industry, deciphering the offering prospectus of healthcare information technology company NantHealth is no simple matter. Allow me to make a cheeky summary: It's a mish-mash of industry jargon and red ink. Compounding this challenge, NantHealth is classified as an ""emerging growth company"" under the JOBS Act, leaving you with a mere two years of financials to try to assess the quality of the business.NantHealth simply does not qualify as an investment; it's a pure speculation. There is a place for speculating, but given the nature of the company's business and the massive uncertainty regarding whether or not it will ever achieve profitability, it is fundamentally unsuitable for individual investors -- except, perhaps, as the equivalent of a trip to Las Vegas (i.e., for entertainment purposes only, and with money you can afford to see vanish).IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.ZTO Express Inc (ADR): Delivering growth and returnsGetting comfortable with ZTO Express' business, by contrast, presents no such conundrum: With $1.3 billion revenues over the trailing 12 months to Sept. 30, it's the largest express delivery service in China, itself the world's largest express delivery market. The business is attractive: ZTO is part of an oligopoly in which the top four domestic companies controlled just over half of the market in 2015. These companies operate a ""network partner"" model whereby they manage central hubs and federate partners that are responsible for pickup and ""last-mile"" deliveries.Consequently, and despite significant growth capital expenditures, ZTO generates healthy cash flows and more than meets its cost of capital, with a return on invested capital of 18.9% in 2015. What can investors expect from ZTO going forward? That's difficult to answer, but two U.S. examples provide some sort of benchmark: Both United Parcel Service, Inc. And FedEx Corporation have beaten the market over the long term:FDX TOTAL RETURN PRICE DATA BY YCHARTS.(Against that observation, one must weigh two countervailing factors: The Chinese e-commerce market, on which express delivery services depend, is less mature than in the U.S., such that higher future growth is possible. On the other hand, the Chinese express delivery market is also less concentrated than its U.S. counterpart, and presumably, therefore, less profitable; UPS and FedEx owned roughly four-fifths of the U.S. market in 2015.)Finally, one cannot discuss a potential investment idea without mentioning price: At 20.7 times forward earnings per share, shares look reasonably priced at first glance -- particularly in light of the business's attractive economics and the growth prospects.IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL.Valvoline Inc: Lubricating cashflowsMore interesting still is Valvoline, which was spun off from specialty chemicals manufacturer Ashland Global Holdings Inc. via initial public offering on Sept. 22. A leading participant in the global finished lubricants market, Valvoline has several attractive assets, including:High-performing retail network: Valvoline operates the second-largest U.S. network of quick lube change retail stores, Valvoline Instant Oil Change (VIOC), with 1,068 locations at the end of September, up from 942 a year earlier (roughly two-thirds of the stores are franchised). VIOC may not be the largest chain, but company-owned stores deliver approximately a third more (36%) daily oil changes, on average, than competing stores. Valvoline's retail network is the heart of the quick lubes segment, which generated more than a quarter of the company's operating income in fiscal 2016.High-quality brand: Dating back 150 years to the creation of its first engine lubricant, Valvoline was and is ""a highly recognized and respected premium consumer brand."" Over time, and thanks to the company's focus, Valvoline's brand has become synonymous with innovation, which leaves it well-positioned to capitalize on the lubricant market's shift toward high-performance products. Core North America, the segment that sells to consumers and installer customers (car dealers, repair shops, etc.), contributed roughly half of Valvoline's 2016 operating income.As you might expect for a business with these characteristics, Valvoline generates plentiful amounts of free cash flow and solid, if unspectacular, returns. Don't let ""unspectacular"" (small-f) fool you: Boring businesses can earn their shareholders a lot of money over the long run! In fact, billionaire value investor Warren Buffett got involved in the lubricants market with Berkshire Hathaway's 2011 acquisition of Lubrizol (which is an important supplier to Valvoline).Speaking of value, at just 15.4 times forward earnings, Valvoline's shares are priced at a discount to peers and the broad market -- a minor Christmas miracle for a business of this caliber. Investors who get in at current prices may well find that the stock will contribute to lubricating returns to new levels of performance for years to come."
2 Key Takeaways From Seagate Technology’s Latest Report,"Feb 1, 2017 at 10:52AM","Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) shares have been soaring after the company reported strong fiscal second quarter results that beat Wall Street estimates by a huge margin. The company is benefiting from a price recovery in the memory market that started in the second half of 2016 and an improved product mix in the form of higher enterprise sales. These two factors allowed Seagate to trump the consensus earnings estimate by an impressive $0.30 per share.The earnings beat seems to have emboldened the company as management has raised its earnings guidance for calendar year 2017 from $2.50 to $4.50 per share. This major bump is not surprising since higher storage demand and a price recovery will act as catalysts for growth.Capacity cuts and higher prices are powering Seagate marginsSeagate's average selling price is gradually gaining momentum as the oversupply in the industry comes down. Over the past three quarters, the average selling price of each hard-disk drive, or HDD, has increased 10% or more from previous lows.DATA FROM SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY. CHART BY AUTHOR.The recent rise in HDD prices can be attributed to manufacturing capacity cuts at Seagate that have led to reduced supply. A tighter supply of DRAM and NAND memory has also contributed to higher memory prices. Seagate had announced last year that it would cut its manufacturing capacity by approximately 35% to a range of 35 million to 40 million drives each quarter.As a part of this initiative, the company announced earlier this month that it will shutter its HDD manufacturing operations in Suzhou, China, laying off around 2,200 employees. This move is in line with the trends seen in the storage industry overall, as storage capacity per hard drive is increasing.IMAGE SOURCE: SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY.Higher capacity per drive means that Seagate now needs to manufacture a smaller number of them to meet the same demands for storage. To add some perspective, Seagate shipped just under 40 million HDD units last quarter as compared to 46 million units in the prior-year period. However, it actually shipped 12.5% more exabytes during that same period, as you can see in the chart above.This is why Seagate is aggressively lowering its manufacturing footprint to improve the utilization rate of its factories. The reductions have allowed the company to lower manufacturing costs by $200 million, while also enjoying $300 million in savings on operating costs in calendar year 2016.The impact of these cost reductions is clearly visible on Seagate's gross and operating margins over the past four quarters:DATA FROM SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY. CHART BY AUTHOR.And this uptrend should see continued momentum -- Seagate's cost basis will decline further as it consolidates its manufacturing operations. Meanwhile, the company should also witness a gradual improvement in the top line due to higher sales from the enterprise segment.A boost from the enterprise businessWith PCs going out of fashion, Seagate has shored up its enterprise business by growing sales of storage products to data centers and servers that need to store data in bulk. Last quarter, enterprise revenue was 37% of the top line, as compared to 34% in the prior-year quarter and 32% the year before.Seagate will continue enjoying gains in this segment as increasing data consumption leads to growing storage needs in data centers. A forecast by Research and Markets suggests that the global data center storage market will grow at an annual rate of 15% until 2020. Network-attached storage, or NAS, will be one of the key drivers of this growth, and Seagate is working hard to tap this segment by launching new products.Small businesses are increasingly using NAS for their IT needs since it is like setting up a private cloud in an office where data can be stored in a centralized location. When the need to scale up arises, NAS allows a business to quickly deploy additional storage without incurring major incremental costs. The flexibility of deploying a NAS means that this segment will clock an annual growth rate of almost 26% until 2019, according to Research and Markets, outpacing the overall data center storage market.The company currently offers three variants of NAS devices that can be scaled from as low as two terabytes to as much as 30. The three configurations are 2-Bay, 4-Bay, and 6-Bay with the number of bays referring to the number of hard drives that can be configured into one NAS.Overall, Seagate has done well mitigating the drop in PC sales by focusing on higher-margin opportunities and scaling back manufacturing. It is tapping the growth in the storage market by shifting toward the enterprise segment where the majority of the growth is going to take place in coming years. This should present Seagate with sustainable opportunities in the storage industry."

Western Digital and Seagate Stocks Win Upgrades: What You Need to Know,"Apr 12, 2017 at 8:00AM","Everything old is new again. For years, we've read stories about how people aren't buying PCs anymore, and how that was lousy news for computer hard drive makers like Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) -- but no more. Yesterday, Wall Street analysts at Longbow Research and JPMorgan simultaneously decided to recommend buying shares of both of these big hard drive makers.Here are three things you need to know about why they did that.HARD DISK DRIVES (HDDS) ARE IN FOCUS ON WALL STREET THIS WEEK. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.1. Upgrading Seagate...We begin our story with Seagate, upgraded on Tuesday from neutral to buy at Longbow Research, with a $55 price target. Last month, as you may recall, we talked a bit about Goldman Sachs and its upgrade of Seagate storage rival Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), which Goldman said would benefit from ""tight"" supplies of NAND flash memory around the globe.That was good news for Micron, which makes a lot of money from NAND. It may also be good news for Seagate, though (which like Micron -- and like Western Digital -- also makes NAND memory). This is because, as TheFly.com reports, ""shortages of NAND are causing demand for hard disk drives to rise"" as an alternative to flash memory. Longbow believes this demand will obey the laws of supply ­and demand, by driving hard disk drive prices up -- boosting profits at Seagate.2. ...and Western Digital as wellAnd not only at Seagate. JPMorgan sees this dynamic of rising hard disk prices benefiting Western Digital stock as well -- maybe even more than Seagate. Additionally, JPMorgan points out that sales of personal computers are ""stabilizing,"" according to TheFly.com, while at the same time Western Digital's costs are falling as the company finds ""synergies"" among its recent acquisitions.Stable PC sales, falling costs, and widening profit margins on hard drives -- that all adds up to higher profits for Seagate, in JPMorgan's view, and justifies an overweight rating and a $116 price target on the stock.3. Just how good will these profits get?Doing a bit of quick pencil work, JPMorgan estimates that Western Digital stock will produce profits of $8.31 per share this year (3% better than previously expected). 2018 profits could be even better -- as much as $11.13 per share. Both those numbers would be significant improvements over the $1.59 per share that Western Digital lost last year. Even the lower number -- $8.31 -- would be enough to make 2017 the most profitable year Western Digital has booked in a single calendar year this millennium.But would that be enough to make Western Digital a buy?The upshot for investorsBecause when you get right down to it, that's what matters to investors: Yeah, 2017 (and 2018) might be very profitable years for Seagate stock, and might be even better for Western Digital. But if the stocks cost too much relative to the profits, then neither stock would make for a good investment.Fortunately, that looks to be not the case. At JPMorgan's projected profits, Western Digital stock looks likely to both earn great profits, and offer great value to investors as well. Here's how the numbers work:JPMorgan is saying Western Digital will earn $8.13 this year. But Western Digital stock only costs about $85 a share. That works out to about a current-year price-to-earnings ratio of 10 on Western Digital stock. And with most analysts on S&P Global Market Intelligence predicting Western Digital will grow profits at 13.5% annually over the next five years, that works out to a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 0.8. Throw in a modest 2.4% dividend yield, and Western Digital stock is looking quite attractively valued indeed.And Seagate? The story there is even better, because whereas JPMorgan bases its Western Digital valuation on projected profits, Seagate is already earning actual profits -- $514 million last year, and more than twice what it earned in 2015. S&P estimates show Seagate growing its earnings fourfold this year, to $3.22 per share. If they're right, that works out to about a current-year earnings valuation of 15 times on the stock. And again, between Seagate's projected growth rate (15%) and its dividend (5.3%), that looks like a very good deal for investors, indeed.Long story short, I'm fully onboard with both these analysts' upgrades this week. Longbow Research may lean toward Seagate, while JPMorgan prefers Western Digital.

Why Seagate Technology Plc Stock Is Soaring Today,"Jan 25, 2017 at 1:23PM","What happenedShares of Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) jumped as much as 24% higher on Wednesday following the release of surprisingly strong second-quarter earnings.So whatAnalysts were expecting earnings of roughly $1.08 per share on revenue near $2.8 billion. Instead, the hard drive maker delivered adjusted earnings of $1.38 per share on $2.9 billion in top-line sales. Unit sales volumes declined as usual, but Seagate saw the product mix leaning heavily into the more profitable enterprise segment. Moreover, earnings guidance for calendar year 2017 was lifted from $2.50 to $4.50 per share.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Now whatSeagate is firing on all cylinders at the moment, and management expects the good times to roll at least into 2018. That's why the stock is trading at fresh 52-week highs today.On the other hand, the company still lacks a clear strategy to either enter or counter the rising tide of solid-state storage devices. If left unchecked, this trend could ride declining memory chip prices all the way into the bulk storage market, where Seagate holds its greatest sway these days. Archrival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), who is reporting results after the closing bell tonight, addressed this issue by acquiring solid-state storage specialist SanDisk last year. If Seagate was hoping for a quick pick-me-up by acquiring a small solid-state specialist, it's probably too late. There are no obvious pure-play SSD options left.Western Digital's report should provide more clarity on the state of the storage market. So far, Seagate looks like a winner -- for now.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Seagate Technology plc Earnings: A Classic Beat-and-Raise Performance,"Jan 25, 2017 at 12:26PM","Hard drive builder Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) reported results on Tuesday night, covering the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. It was a solid performance, and share prices jumped more than 12% in after hours trading.Seagate's second-quarter results: The raw numbersMetricQ2 2017Q2 2016Year-Over-Year ChangeRevenue$2.89 billion$2.99 billion(3%)Net income$412 million$246 million67%GAAP EPS (diluted)$1.38$0.8268%DATA SOURCE: SEAGATE.What happened with Seagate this quarter?PC systems may be going out of style, but Seagate is making up for that negative trend by selling large volumes of enterprise storage products and consumer-grade drives nestled in media storage or personal data backup devices.Thanks to a richer product mix and disciplined manufacturing operations, Seagate's gross margins landed at 30.8% -- the highest level seen since the middle of 2012.Wall Street analysts would have settled for adjusted earnings in the neighborhood of $1.08 per share, paired with roughly $2.83 billion in top-line revenue. Seagate exceeded the Street's sales projections and crushed their average earnings estimate.Average selling prices continued their eternal downward march. Seagate collected $42 per terabyte of storage capacity sold in the second quarter, down from $49 a year ago and $61 per terabyte the year before that.On top of that revenue-sapping trend, Seagate shipped 39.9 million drives this quarter. That's 13% below the 46 million units that were shipped in the year-ago period and a 30% decline over two years.At the same time, the average drive was 30% larger this year than in the year-ago quarter, and 60% roomier than the average drive in Q2 of 2015. Taken together, Seagate shipped a total of 68.2 exabytes of storage capacity this quarter:IMAGE SOURCE: SEAGATE.Seagate's management provided the following guidance for calendar year 2017:Operating expenses are trending downward while revenues should rise in 2017. On the bottom line, CEO Steve Luczo expects to deliver calendar-year earnings of at least $4.50 per share. That would be at least a 37% increase over the $3.28 of adjusted earnings per share that Seagate collected in calendar year 2016.Luczo underscored that these projections are significantly more positive than the ones he offered last summer, setting the company up for even greater things in 2018 and beyond. As a reminder, management was painting a non-GAAP earnings bullseye around $2.50 per share for fiscal year 2017 just two quarters ago.What management had to sayIn a prepared statement, Steve Luczo congratulated his employees on a job well done and then set up a rosy view of the next few years.""Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the long-term opportunities for Seagate's business as enterprises and consumers embrace and benefit from the shift of storage to cloud and mobile applications,"" Luczo said. ""Seagate is well positioned to work with the leaders in this digital transformation with a broad market-leading storage solution portfolio.""IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Looking aheadSeagate is doing an excellent job of replacing its fading PC sales with high-quality revenue in the enterprise and consumer electronics markets. On the downside, management barely mentioned flash-based SSD products on the earnings call, and sales in that department remain forgettably small.In other words, there's life in this old clunker yet but I am not completely convinced that Seagate has a sustainable uptrend going on here. As flash memory storage grows larger and cheaper, there will come a time when that solution becomes a viable alternative to Seagate's magnetic discs even for bulk storage situations. Manufacturing improvements and fiscal discipline can only go so far.The clock is ticking, and I don't see Seagate hustling to get ready for the next era of data storage."
3 Top Data Storage Stocks to Buy in 2017,"May 23, 2017 at 12:13PM","The data storage market is sometimes overlooked by growth-oriented tech investors -- it generally conjures up thoughts of aging HDDs (hard disk drives) in a highly commoditized market. But the data storage market also includes higher-growth categories like SSDs (solid state drives), cloud backup solutions, and enterprise storage platforms.Data storage needs will inevitably rise due to the growing use of streaming media, cloud storage solutions, cloud-based apps, data virtualization, and other data-intensive tasks. Let's examine three solid data storage stocks which will likely benefit from that growth -- Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Carbonite (NASDAQ:CARB), and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP).IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Western DigitalWestern Digital acquired flash memory maker SanDisk for about $19 billion last year. That move complemented WD's other acquisitions in the flash memory space, including Virident, STEC, VeloBit, Amplidata, Skyera, and Hitachi's hard drive unit, which now handles most of WD's NAND assets.All these moves diversified WD's top line away from its aging HDD business with higher-growth SSD and flash memory products. By comparison, its rival Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) still generates most of its revenue from HDD sales, and has a much weaker presence in enterprise SSDs.Western Digital has posted three straight quarters of double-digit annual sales growth since the SanDisk acquisition closed, and analysts expect its revenue and earnings to respectively grow 47% and 75% this year. That momentum is expected to continue with 6% sales growth and 34% earnings growth next year. That makes WD -- which trades at just 9 times forward earnings with a forward yield of 2.3% -- seem like an undervalued play on the data storage industry.CarboniteCarbonite provides a cloud backup platform for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with fewer than 300 employees, which is generally a less crowded market than the one for larger enterprises. The company greatly expanded its storage capabilities by acquiring Seagate's EVault cloud backup service for $14 million last January -- a bargain, since Seagate bought the service for $185 million back in 2006.Shares of Carbonite have more than doubled over the past 12 months, fueled by the company's five straight quarters of double-digit sales growth. Those numbers were inflated by its acquisition of EVault, but the company also beat top and bottom line forecasts during each quarter due to the stronger-than-expected growth of EVault and cost-cutting synergies between its older and newer platforms.Wall Street expects Carbonite's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 17% and 28% this year, followed by 10% sales growth and 29% earnings growth next year. Carbonite may look pricey at 67 times earnings, which is well above its industry average of 28, but its forward P/E of 25 looks fairly reasonable.NetAppNetApp is one of the largest data storage and management service providers in the world. To widen its moat against rivals like Dell EMC, Seagate, and Western Digital, NetApp expanded over the past decade by acquiring Riverbed Technology's backup and protection products, flash storage vendor SolidFire, and numerous smaller companies.NetApp is a slow-growth company. Wall Street expects its revenue to fall 1% this year and rise 2% next year. However, its earnings are expected to rise 27% this year and 14% next year, fueled by its growth in the higher-margin flash array market, reduced operating expenses, and share buybacks.NetApp pays a forward dividend yield of 1.9%, and it has hiked that payout annually for three straight years. Its current P/E of 36 might look pricey, but it's actually much lower than industry average of 82 -- which makes the company a decent ""best in breed"" enterprise storage play for conservative investors.But mind the risks...Western Digital, Carbonite, and NetApp all have unique strengths in the data storage market, but they also have significant weaknesses. WD's near-term growth could be impacted by an ongoing legal battle with Toshiba over the divestment of a joint venture. Carbonite's growth could slow down if bigger enterprise rivals expand into the SMB market. NetApp could fall behind the data storage tech curve if it prioritizes cost cutting measures over R&D investments. Therefore, investors should do their due diligence and weigh these risks against the potential rewards before buying any of these data storage stocks.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

10 Highest-Yielding Dividend Stocks,"May 1, 2017 at 7:43AM","Income investors naturally gravitate toward stocks that offer up the highest yields. But not every stock with a fat payout is an automatic buy. In fact, stocks with big yields are often quite risky, which is why income investors need to be choosy about which stocks they buy. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Knowing that, let's take a closer look at the 10 highest-yielding stocks from the S&P 500 to see if any of them could be worth owning.  CompanyTickerDividend YieldFrontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR)21.7%CenturyLink(NYSE:CTL)8.5%Mattel(NASDAQ:MAT)7%Ford(NYSE:F)5.3%Seagate Technology(NASDAQ:STX)6.1%Macy's(NYSE:M)5.1%Kohl's(NYSE:KSS)5.1%Staples(NASDAQ:SPLS)4.9%Occidental Petroleum(NYSE:OXY)4.9%AT&T(NYSE:T)4.9%DATA SOURCE: FINVIZ, AS OF APRIL 24, 2017. THIS LIST DOES NOT INCLUDE REITS. Is the payout sustainable?The first metric I like to look at when I'm evaluating a dividend stock is the payout ratio. This ratio can be found by dividing a company's annual dividend payment by its last four quarters of earnings. The resulting figure will give an investor a quick glance at how much of a company's profits are being consumed by the dividend. In general, any number above 80% is a yellow flag, and a payout ratio over 100% hints that trouble could be brewing.Here's what this ratio looks like for each of the 10 companiesCompanyPayout RatioFrontier Communications NMCenturyLink186%Mattel165%Ford52%Seagate Technology147%Macy's75%Kohl's64%Staples54%Occidental PetroleumNMAT&T92%TABLE SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE. NM = NOT MEANINGFUL; THESE COMPANIES REPORTED LOSSES OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS.Right off the bat, we can eliminate several of these companies from consideration. Both Frontier Communications and Occidental Petroleum haven't even reported a profit over the past four quarters, which is why neither has a payout ratio. That's a good enough reason to give them a pass.CenturyLink, Mattel, and Seagate Technology all have payout ratios that exceed 100%. That means the dividend checks they're sending off to investors exceed their net income. That's not a recipe for long-term sustainability, which makes me believe they should be avoided as well.Are they growing? The five remaining companies all look as if they can afford their dividend payment for the time being. Next, I like to get a sense of a company's growth potential. My reasoning is that an income stock must be able to increase its dividend payment over time to be considered attractive. You can't do that unless you also have a growing profit stream. To get a rough idea of a company's growth potential, I like to look at a company's historical earnings growth rate and its projected future profit growth rate over five-year periods of time.Here's what these metrics look like for our five remaining companies:CompanyActual Earnings Growth Over Past 5 YearsEstimated Earnings Growth Over Next 5 YearsFord 5.6%2.9%Macy's (3.7%)18.6%Kohl's(3%)8.6%Staples(9.5%)2.5%AT&T5.8%7.4%DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE.This data shows that the past five years haven't been kind to big-box retailers such as Macy's, Kohl's, and Staples. That's because the entire retail sector has been under pressure as a result of increased competition from e-commerce companies such as Amazon.com. Each of these companies is responding to the pressure by closing stores and investing in their own e-commerce capabilities.Will these tactics drive long-term profit growth? That's still unclear, but Wall Street believes that Macy's and Kohl's will be successful and drive solid earnings growth over the next few years. If so, then both companies could turn into fine investments. By contrast, Staples' bottom line has taken a much bigger beating over the past five years, and market watchers are barely expecting any growth at all from here. Steering clear is likely to be the right call here.As for Ford, the company's modest payout ratio suggests that its dividend is easily sustainable. However, investors need to keep in mind that auto sales are highly cyclical. That's why it might be a mistake to place too much emphasis on a single year's earnings results. In addition, there are signs that auto sales have peaked in North America, which, if true, could spell doom for Ford's near-term profit potential. Analysts appear to have accounted for that threat by forecasting only 2.9% profit growth from here. That's not an attractive enough growth rate to warrant an investment, in my book.Finally, AT&T has proved itself to be a steady-Eddy giant that consistently cranks out profit growth each and every year. That trend should continue, since AT&T maintains a strong competitive position in the U.S. wireless space and it recently acquired DirecTV. Its pending merger with Time Warner could also be a win for shareholders if it gets the green light from regulators. While investors need to keep a watchful eye on the company's high payout ratio, a growing stream of profits should help to ensure that its dividend remains safe.Are any worth buying?While I'd hesitate to call any of these stocks a screaming buy right now, I must say that my favorite names from this list are Kohl's, Macy's, and AT&T. All three offer investors a sustainable dividend yield and a shot at posting profit growth over the next five years. That's a compelling combination.10 stocks we like better than AT&TWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

10 Highest Dividend-Yielding Stocks,"Feb 4, 2017 at 11:47AM","Many investors are naturally drawn to stocks that offer up a high dividend yield. However, a high yield can often indicate that a company is in trouble. For that reason, income investors need to be very picky about which dividend stocks they choose to buy.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.With that in mind, here's a look at 10 of the highest-yielding stocks from the S&P 500. Let's put these companies to the test to determine if any of them could actually be worth owning today.CompanyTickerDividend YieldFrontier Communications (NASDAQ: FTR)11.9%CenturyLink(NYSE:CTL)8.3%Mattel(NASDAQ:MAT)5.7%Seagate Technology(NASDAQ:STX)5.6%Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS)5.2%Macy's(NYSE:M)5.2%Kohl's(NYSE:KSS)5.1%Entergy Corp.(NYSE:ETR)4.8%Ford(NYSE:F)4.8%FirstEnergy (NYSE:FE)4.6%DATA SOURCE: FINVIZ, AS OF JAN. 29, 2017. THIS LIST DOES NOT INCLUDE REITS OR LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, SINCE THEY PLAY BY THEIR OWN SET OF RULES.Test No. 1: Is the payout sustainable?A must-know metric for any dividend stock is the payout ratio. To find this figure, we simply divide the company's annual dividend payment by its trailing twelve months earnings. Ideally, we want to see a number that is well below 90%.Here's a look at the current payout ratio for each of these companies:CompanyPayout RatioFrontier Communications N/ACenturyLink128%Mattel145%Seagate Technology146%Staples 54%Macy's70%Kohl's61%Entergy Corp.48%Ford33%FirstEnergy 51%DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE.Frontier Communications hasn't produced a profit over the past four quarters, which is why its payout ratio isn't available. That makes this a stock that we can immediately remove from contention.CenturyLink, Mattel, and Seagate Technology boast payout ratios over 100%, which means their dividend payouts are higher than their net income. That makes them stocks to avoid as well.Test No. 2: Is the business growing?The six stocks left on our list all appear to have sustainable dividend payments, which is a great start. However, the best income stocks increase their payouts over time, so we have to consider these companies' growth prospects as well. For this test, I like to look at both a company's historical earnings growth rate and its projected profit growth rates over the next five years.Here's what both of these figures look like for our remaining six stocks:CompanyActual Earnings Growth Over Past 5 YearsEstimated Earnings Growth Over Next 5 YearsStaples (13.8%)1.3%Macy's 10.2%18.6%Kohl's(1.2%)7.7%Entergy Corp.(16.5%)(8.2%)Ford(25.3%)2.9%First Energy(10.9%)(5.2%)DATA SOURCE: FINVIZ.Both Entergy and FirstEnergy have shown negative earnings growth over the past five years, and Wall Street believes that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. Thus, even though they offer up big dividend yields, I think investors would be best off avoiding these stocks.Staples' historic growth rate is also a cause for concern. The company's profits have been shrinking by double digits each year because of relentless pressure from e-commerce companies such as Amazon.com. While Staples has a plan to reverse the trend, market watchers are only expecting meager profit growth from here. That makes this stock a pass in my book.Ford is a bit of a head-scratcher. The company's stock is dirt cheap and its payout ratio is sustainable, but the markets are worried that we have hit peak auto sales in North America. If true, that could suggest that sales and profit are at their cyclical peak, so the company's stock may not appear to be as cheap as it looks. The other long-term threat is that ride-sharing services reduce the long-term demand for new auto sales, which would be a bitter pill to swallow. Those factors are probably why analysts are expecting minuscule profit growth from here, so I think investors would be better served to look elsewhere.Two stocks to considerWith a sustainable dividend and high single-digit earnings growth potential, Kohl's is an interesting big-box retailer to consider right now. While the retail world is rapidly evolving, Kohl's is adapting by shuttering underperforming stores, lowering its costs, and using its huge cash flow to buyback shares. While sales growth will be anemic for the foreseeable future, if Kohl's can steadily march its bottom line higher, then its stock could grow into a winner from here.Like Kohl's, Macy's stock is also down on its luck after the company reported weak holiday sales. In response, Macy's management team is getting aggressive by closing hundreds of stores, even some that are currently profitable. The company plans on using the proceeds to build out its website and mobile app to help it compete more effectively. In addition, the company plans to unload some of its valuable real estate assets to put the money to work for shareholders. When combined, the markets believe that these moves will allow the company's earnings to grow by more than 18% annually over the next five years. If true, that makes Macy's a stock that the markets may be overlooking.So there you have it -- our initial list of 10 high-yield stocks has been whittled down to just two. While Kohl's and Macy's are far from risk-free, investors who are after a high yield should certainly give these two businesses a closer look. "
5 Highest-Dividend-Yielding Stocks,"Jan 17, 2017 at 1:30PM","Check out our latest picks for stocks with high-yielding dividends.Today's low-interest rate environment has forced many investors to put money to work in the stock market to generate income. Unfortunately, many of these investors simply buy the highest-yielding dividend stocks they find, which can be a mistake. Here’s how to be selective and pick the best dividend stocks.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.With that in mind, let's take a closer look at the five highest-yielding stocks from the S&P 500 to see if any of them could be worth owning:CompanyTickerDividend YieldFrontier Communications(NASDAQ:FTR)11.9%CenturyLink(NYSE:CTL)8.6%Seagate Technology(NASDAQ:STX)6.8%Iron Mountain(NYSE:IRM)6.6%Host Hotels and Resorts(NYSE:HST)5.5%DATA SOURCE: FINVIZ.COM.Telecoms in trouble?Income investors will likely notice immediately that Frontier Communications and CenturyLink offer massive payouts. That's because regional telecoms offer limited growth prospects, so managers opt to return profits to shareholders in the form of massive dividend payments.That sounds attractive, but income investors should always look at a company's payout ratio before they hit the buy button:CompanyPayout Ratio (TTM Earnings)Frontier CommunicationsN/ACenturyLink128%DATA SOURCES: YAHOO! FINANCE AND FINVIZ.COM. TTM = TRAILING 12 MONTH.Frontier Communications doesn't even have a payout ratio because its net income over the past four quarters is negative, which is a big red flag. Meanwhile, CenturyLink's payout ratio of 128% means that the company's dividend payment exceeds its net income, which is not a good sign, either.Another fact that should give investors pause is that both of these companies have been on the decline. Over the past five years, both Frontier and CenturyLink have seen their net income drop considerably. What's more, analysts think that both companies are going to report big drops in net income next year, too.With suspect payout ratios and net incomes heading in reverse, investors would probably be wise to avoid both of these stocks.A company in transitionSeagate Technology is a data-storage company that has hit a rough patch. Demand for the company's legacy hard-disk drives has been on the decline. That's caused the company's revenue and profits to drop drastically over the past five years:STX REVENUE (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.The earnings plunge has pushed Seagate's payout ratio up to 200%, which means that its dividend payment currently far exceeds its profits. That figure hints that it could be on the chopping block soon.Thankfully, the demand for cloud computing should ensure that this company's main business won't completely disappear anytime soon. Better still, Seagate's free cash flow production is meaningfully higher than its net income, so its dividend isn't in as much danger as its payout ratio suggests.Still, given the company's declining profits and lofty payout ratio, investors should probably approach this stock with caution.REITs to the rescue?Many income investors have turned to real estate investment trusts, or REITs, to help them generate a strong yield. REITs are required by law to pay out at least 90% of their net income as distributions, which often gives them yields that vastly exceed the market's in general. Iron Mountain and Host Hotels and Properties are REITs that currently yield 6.6% and 5.5%, respectively, which makes them worthy of further study.Host Hotels and Properties owns a collection of high-quality hotels that are spread throughout the world. While the hotel business can be quite lucrative while the economy is heating up, demand can nosedive when tough times approach. During the Great Recession, Host Hotels was forced to slash its dividend payment, which was an unpopular decision with shareholders. The long recovery has allowed management to grow its payout consistently over the last few years, but the company's dividend is still well below its 2008 high.IMAGE SOURCE: HOST HOTELS AND PROPERTIES.Iron Mountain is a provider of storage and information management services. The company counts 94% of the Fortune 1000 as customers, which makes its business extremely well diversified. What's great about this business is that its customers sign multiyear agreements, which helps protect the company from downturns. Better yet, this business benefits from low maintenance costs, which helps it fund a strong -- and growing -- dividend.Are any of them worth buying?I must admit that Iron Mountain is my favorite stock from this list. I like that the company operates a boring but reliable business that counts a number of high-profile companies as customers. Those factors give the company a great chance at steadily improving its revenue, income, and distribution in the years ahead. Thus, if you are on the hunt for a high-yield dividend stock, Iron Mountain might be right for you.10 stocks we like better than Iron MountainWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The 3 Best Dividend Stocks in Data Storage,"Jun 1, 2017 at 5:58PM","The data storage market is generally considered a slow-growth, heavily commoditized market. But as I mentioned in a recent article, there are still good growth plays in the space that crushed the S&P 500's return over the past 12 months. Today, I'll take a closer look at the best dividend plays within that industry -- Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP).IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.Western DigitalWestern Digital, the biggest hard drive maker in the world, pays a forward dividend yield of 2.2%. Its earnings-based payout ratio is at a whopping 219%, but that figure was distorted by its $19 billion acquisition of SanDisk last year.However, Western Digital spent just 24% of its free cash flow on dividends over the past 12 months, and SanDisk's assets are now boosting its cash flows -- which gives it plenty of room for future hikes. It's also raised its dividend annually for four straight years.SOURCE: YCHARTSWD's purchases of flash storage makers like SanDisk helped it pivot away from the aging HDD (hard disk drive) market with smaller SSDs (solid-state drives) which load data faster, consume less power, and have no moving parts.The SanDisk acquisition also helps WD benefit from growing demand for NAND flash memory -- which has caused prices to surge worldwide. Analysts expect WD's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 47% and 75% this year (due to the SanDisk purchase), followed by 6% sales growth and 34% earnings growth in 2018.SeagateSeagate, the second largest hard drive maker in the world, pays a much higher forward yield of 5.8%. It spent 77% of its earnings and 38% of its free cash flow on dividends over the past 12 months.Those ratios look sustainable, but Seagate hasn't raised its dividend since 2015 due to cash flow concerns. However, Seagate's free cash flow has rebounded over the past year as data-heavy applications boosted demand for its enterprise storage products.SOURCE: YCHARTSSeagate has a much smaller presence in the consumer SSD market than WD, but it still sells enterprise SSDs to big companies. It's partnered with memory chipmaker Micron (NASDAQ:MU) in these efforts, which partly offsets its lack of a dedicated flash memory division like Western Digital's SanDisk.However, SanDisk lacks WD's growth momentum: its revenue is expected to dip 2% this year, but its earnings -- boosted by buybacks and better cost controls -- are expected to nearly double.NetAppNetApp is one of the biggest providers of data storage and management services in the world. It pays a forward dividend yield of 2%, and it spent 41% of its earnings and 26% of its free cash flow on those payments over the past 12 months.NetApp started paying a dividend in 2013, and has hiked its dividend annually in every subsequent year. But unlike Western Digital and Seagate, NetApp's free cash flow has declined in recent years due to a series of acquisitions -- including its $870 million purchase of flash storage vendor Solidfire last year.SOURCE: YCHARTSNetApp is a slow growth stock, and Wall Street expects just 2% sales growth this year. However, its earnings are expected to grow 11% this year as it cuts stock buybacks and taps the synergies of its acquired businesses. However, investors should note that rising NAND prices -- which act as a tailwind for Western Digital -- represents a headwind for NetApp, which purchases the chips for its flash-based devices and services.The key takeawaysWD, Seagate, and NetApp are all decent income stocks, and they're not terribly expensive relative to the industry average P/E of 85 for data storage providers. WD has a negative trailing P/E, due to the SanDisk acquisition, but it trades at just 9 times forward earnings. Seagate and NetApp respectively trade at 18 and 37 times earnings.Those ratios are surprisingly low, considering that WD and Seagate both nearly doubled over the past 12 months as NetApp rallied nearly 60%. But investors should also be aware that an economic slowdown could cause big orders of enterprise storage devices and services to abruptly stall out.

What Happened in the Stock Market Today,"Jan 25, 2017 at 5:18PM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGESStrong earnings results pushed stocks higher on Wednesday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) crossed the 20,000-point mark for the first time. It and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) index both finished higher by more than 0.75%.Today's stock marketIndexPercentage ChangePoint ChangeDow0.78%155.80S&P 5000.80%18.30DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE.Financial stocks were among the biggest gainers, which helped the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) rise 1.6%. In the losing column, a tick down in the price of gold sent the leveraged Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:NUGT) lower by 5%.A few individual stocks did significantly better than the market on its record-notching day, including Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX).Seagate's stabilizing businessSeagate shares spiked 15% following the hard drive specialist's strong quarterly results. Revenue ticked down slightly to $2.8 billion. Earnings, on the other hand, came in well above expectations at $1.38 per share. Consensus estimates had been targeting closer to $1.08 per share.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The business benefited from several positive trends, including declining expenses and a shift toward higher-margin high-capacity drives. As a result, Seagate managed sharply improved profitability despite lower overall demand and weakening average selling prices.""The company's product execution, operational performance, and financial results improved every quarter throughout 2016,"" CEO Steve Luczo said in a press release. In an accompanying presentation to investors, the company cited quarter-to-quarter gains in operating margin, from 1% in the first quarter, to 4%, 8%, and then 13% in the fourth quarter, as evidence of the stabilization of its business. Cash flow also rose to a near-record $656 million.The surging profits are making Seagate's dividend safer. The payout now represents 81% of earnings over the last six months, compared to nearly 180% in the prior-year period. That ratio should continue falling now that the company expects to earn $4.50 per share in 2017 -- up from its $2.50-per-share forecast issued in early August.Boeing's profit boostBoeing was the Dow's biggest winner, rising 5% after its quarterly earnings announcement. Revenue fell 1% for the quarter and by 2% for the full year as its defense, space, and security segments declined. Profitability jumped, though, as operating margin nearly doubled to 9.4% of sales. That improvement was the biggest factor behind the industrial giant's 64% spike in operating earnings.IMAGE SOURCE: BOEING.Management highlighted the improved operating and financial results that allowed Boeing to plow cash back into its business while increasing dividend payments and stock buyback spending. ""We led the industry in commercial airplane deliveries for the fifth consecutive year,"" CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a prepared statement, ""and produced record operating cash flow, which fueled investment in innovation and our people and generated significant return to shareholders.""Looking ahead, Boeing expects to deliver as many as 765 commercial aircraft for $63 billion of revenue at a near-10% operating margin. A further $28 billion from its defense, space, and security segment should bring total sales to about $91 billion, or 4% below 2016's result.Yet Boeing should produce far greater profits from that lower sales base. Executives are projecting earnings of $9.20 per share, up 27% from this past year's figure. Investors cheered that surprisingly high outlook by pushing the stock to a new record on Wednesday."
10 Highest Dividend-Yielding Stocks,"Mar 5, 2017 at 5:15PM","Today's persistently low-interest-rate environment has forced many investors to put money in the stock market in an effort to generate yield. Naturally, many of these investors are simply searching for the highest dividend-yielding stocks that they can find in order to maximize their income. However, not every high-yield stock is worth owning, so these investors need to be choosy about which companies they choose to buy.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.With that in mind, here's a look at the 10 highest-yielding stocks from the S&P 500. Let's put these companies to the test to see if any could actually be worthy of an investment. CompanyTickerDividend YieldFrontier Communications (NASDAQ: FTR)12.8%CenturyLink(NYSE: CTL)8.8%Mattel(NASDAQ: MAT)5.9%Pitney Bowes(NYSE:PBI)5.4%Seagate Technology plc(NASDAQ: STX)5.3%Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS)5.2%Ford(NYSE:F)4.7%AT&T(NYSE:T)4.7%Kohl's(NYSE:KSS)4.7%Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY)4.6%THIS TABLE EXCLUDES REITS. DATA SOURCES: FINVIZ.Test No. 1 -- The payout ratio Smart dividend investors know that they need to check a company's payout ratio before making a purchase. This metric is calculated by dividing a company's annual dividend payment by its trailing 12-month earnings. A payout ratio greater than 100% means that the company is paying out more in dividends than it generates in net income, which is a worrisome sign.Here's a look at the current payout ratio for each of these companies.CompanyPayout ratioFrontier Communications N/ACenturyLink113% Mattel143% Pitney Bowes45%Seagate Technology plc111%Staples 54% Ford34%AT&T69%Kohl's55%Occidental PetroleumN/ADATA SOURCES: AUTHORS CALCULATION.YAHOO! FINANCE.Using this data, we can immediately remove several companies from contention. Both Frontier Communications and Occidental Petroleum recorded a net loss over the past year, which is why neither sports a payout ratio. Investors should consider skipping them entirely.Meanwhile, CenturyLink, Mattel, and Seagate Technology all have payout ratios that exceed 100%. That hints that their dividends will not be sustainable in the long term unless something changes. I think investors should give these businesses a pass, too.Let's subject the remaining five companies to another simple test to whittle down the list a bit further.Test No. 2 -- GrowthThe next metric that I think investors should look at is growth. After all, companies with declining profits are unlikely to be able to grow their dividends over time, which makes the company a much less attractive investment.While these metrics are far from perfect, I like to look at a company's earnings-per-share (EPS) growth over the past five years and its estimated future growth rate to get a sense of what market watchers expect to happen.Here's what those numbers look like:CompanyPast Five-Year EPS Actual GrowthEstimated Five-Year Future EPS GrowthPitney Bowes(25%)4%Staples (13%)2%Ford (25%)2%AT&T26%8%Kohl's(6%)8%DATA SOURCES: FINVIZ.The past half-decade has not been very prosperous for Pitney Bowes' bottom line. The advancement of new communication methods and increasing competition from companies like Stamps.com have slowly eroded the company's competitive advantage. While management is investing in new software in an effort to better compete, market watchers are expecting profit growth to be meager.Staples is another company facing growth challenges. Competitive pressures from e-commerce companies have been driving away demand for the company's brick-and-mortar stores. In response, the company is closing stores and investing in its own online channels, but these actions are expected to keep profit growth in check.Finally, analysts are not feeling all that bullish about Ford's long-term profit growth, either. Those worries likely stem from concerns that North American auto sales are nearing their peak, which hints that the company's top- and bottom-lines could stall. Mix in the lingering competitive threat from companies like Tesla and the uncertainty surrounding autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing services, and it's easy to understand why market watchers are feeling cautious.Given these three businesses' tepid growth prospects, I think it's a good idea to remove them from consideration, as well.Worthy of a closer lookKohl's offers investors a well-covered dividend and the potential for high single-digit EPS growth, which is an attractive combination. However, it's no secret that big-box retailers have been under a lot of pressure in recent years due to the ever-changing consumer landscape.In response, Kohl's is adapting by closing stores, working to lower its cost structure, and returning its ample profits to shareholders in the form of a dividend and share repurchases. Those decisions will likely cause its top line to slowly decline, but its bottom line should still be able to march higher. If the plan works, then it could turn Kohl's into a decent investment, especially from today's depressed share price.Telecom giant AT&T also offers investors reasons for optimism. While the wireless market in the U.S. is mature, AT&T's massive user base should ensure that it cranks out copious amounts of cash flow for years to come. Meanwhile, the company's recent acquisition of DirecTV offers investors a decent shot at seeing bottom-line growth.The company's pending merger with Time Warner could also provide long-term upside if the deal gets the thumbs up from regulators. All in all, AT&T's investors stand a great chance of earning a huge yield while they wait for the company's growth strategy to play out.While Kohl's and AT&T are far from risk free, they both offer investors a sustainable dividend payment and a decent shot at earnings growth. That makes me think that these two stocks are worth a closer look if a big yield is what you seek.10 stocks we like better than AT&TWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What to Expect From Marvell Technology Group’s Q4 and Fiscal 2017 Earnings,"Mar 1, 2017 at 11:38AM","IMAGE SOURCE: MARVELL TECHNOLOGY GROUP.Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ:MRVL) stock is up over 21% in the last six months, thanks to strong bottom line beats in the past two quarters. The company will look to maintain this momentum when it releases its fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results after the bell on March 2.Marvell has been restructuring its business to tap the potential of the Internet of Things and the cloud. It has dialed back its mobile presence and is now busy shutting down some additional non-core operations. These moves should have a positive impact on upcoming earnings -- here's what investors can expect on Thursday.How the numbers might lookWall Street expects Marvell revenue to drop 8% from the year-ago period to $565 million, in line with company guidance. As it turns out, analysts were originally looking for higher revenue of $594 million, but seasonal weakness in the storage business forced the company to bring the numbers down.Now, Marvell's storage business brings in half of its revenue, with Seagate and Western Digital accounting for about 30% of the top line. Last quarter, Western Digital shipped 6% fewer hard-disk drives (HDDs) year-over-year, while Seagate saw muted growth of just 2.5%.By comparison, inventory replenishments and higher demand drove Marvell's sequential storage revenue growth by 19% in the third quarter. This was powered by an increase in both Seagate and Western Digital's HDD shipments -- up 6% and 18%, respectively. As a result, muted HDD shipments during the December quarter will weigh on the company's revenue.But the weak revenue is not going to drag down earnings. Wall Street estimates that Marvell will clock earnings of $0.19 per share during the period, up from $0.11 per share last year, a sign that its restructuring efforts are succeeding.Marvell had decided to exit its mobile business back in Sept. 2015, so it could shift its focus toward opportunities in the Internet of Things, automotive, and networking markets. The company estimated that exiting the business would generate $170 million to $220 million in annualized operating cost reductions, completing the transition by the end of fiscal 2016. Therefore, the upcoming results will capture the complete effect of the mobile restructuring effort and should show strong earnings gains.As it turns out, Marvell has beaten earnings estimates by huge margins in three of the last four quarters as it moved away from the mobile business (its one miss was due to restructuring-related expenses):Fiscal QuarterActual EPSExpected EPSEarnings SurpriseQ4 2016$0.11$0.0922%Q1 2017$0.01$0.07(86%)Q2 2017$0.18$0.1164%Q3 2017$0.20$0.1267%DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCEWhat about the guidance?Undoubtedly, Marvell's storage business will have the biggest say in determining its guidance. The good news for investors is that both Seagate and Western Digital are expected to see a bump in their businesses.Seagate management expects revenue to climb 4.5% from last year to $2.7 billion in the ongoing quarter. Western Digital, meanwhile, will benefit from a pick-up in notebook shipments in both February and March, according to BMO Capital.The improving business scenario at two of its biggest customers will be a tailwind for Marvell. As it turns out, consensus forecasts pin fiscal 2018 first quarter revenue at $544 million. Though this is flat year-over-year, it marks a big improvement over the fourth quarter's projected decline.What's more, Marvell could log strong earnings growth in the new fiscal year as well. Last November, the company had announced that it will slash 900 jobs worldwide in a bid to consolidate its research and development work. More importantly, the R&D reduction won't have a major impact on revenue. The company points out that the affected R&D programs accounted for just 7% of revenue, but the move could reduce annual operating expenses by approximately $190 million, almost equal to the savings realized from shutting down the mobile business.The restructuring charges will amount to $90 million to $110 million this year. Marvell expects to complete the entire exercise within the first three quarters of fiscal 2018, so it should end up boosting earnings once again in fiscal 2018. Analysts seem to agree with this outlook as they project earnings to grow to $0.90 per share in the new fiscal year from $0.58 in the previous one.Marvell Technology investors, therefore, can be optimistic, and a strong earnings report should confirm that sentiment.10 stocks we like better than Marvell Technology GroupWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Intel Corporation's Optane Cache for PCs Sounds Cool… If It Works,"Jan 12, 2017 at 8:08PM","A few days ago, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) formally unveiled its seventh-generation Core processor family for desktop computers, known as Kaby Lake. With the launch came new chips from Intel as well as new motherboards using the company's new Z200-series motherboard chipsets (the top of the line ones targeted at high-end personal computers are known as Z270).The main new feature that came with the Z270 chipset is support for the company's new Optane memory technology. Optane is the marketing name for the company's upcoming 3D XPoint memory technology, a new type of memory that's supposed to be much faster than the NAND flash used to build today's solid state storage drives.3D XPOINT MEMORY CHIPS, WHICH INTEL MARKETS AS OPTANE. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL. Intel's marketing pitch for Optane is simple: a small Optane-based solid state drive can be installed into a system alongside a traditional hard disk drive to deliver ""[solid state drive]-like speed and [hard disk drive] capacity.""IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL. This all sounds like a cool idea, and in theory, could boost Intel's PC dollar content share while also helping the hard disk drive makers. Let's look at how it could do so, if the technology works as advertised (a big ""if"").The advertised value propositionThe value proposition, particularly for desktop personal computer users, goes something like this. Hard disk drives, which are produced primarily by Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), are generally very inexpensive on a per-gigabyte basis. To put this into perspective, it costs about $260 to purchase a 1-terabyte solid state drive for a notebook or desktop computer (one can spend much more for faster/better quality drives, though). A 4-terabyte hard disk drive (that's four times the storage capacity as the solid-state drive mentioned above), runs only about $163 as of a recent check.This means that the cost per gigabyte (or, more generally, cost per unit of storage capacity) of hard disk drives is still substantially lower than those of solid state drives, even as the latter's cost has come down considerably over the years.For users who require lots of storage space for, say, high-resolution videos, video games (a single modern triple-A game can take up over 100 gigabytes of space on a computer disk drive), or other large programs, building systems with all flash storage can be prohibitively expensive.At the same time, solid state drives are much faster than hard disk drives, so users may want to keep performance-sensitive applications on a solid-state drive, while relegating the remaining files and programs to higher-capacity but slower hard disk drives.The value proposition that Intel and its partners are advertising goes something like this: A small, but very fast Optane-based solid state storage drive (Intel says Optane is substantially faster than traditional NAND flash) acting as a ""cache"" to a large hard disk drive can allow a system to enjoy similar storage performance to one that's equipped with NAND-flash based storage drives for a much lower overall cost. Potential winners and losersIf the technology works as claimed and sees significant adoption, then there could be winners and losers.Among the potential winners, I see Intel, as it would be able to gain content share in personal computers by selling Optane-based solid state drives (Intel does not supply hard disk drives today, and while it does build consumer NAND-flash solid state drives, its share in the consumer market isn't high).The hard disk drive makers, too, could benefit. If Optane combined with hard disk drives really delivers the performance of all-flash desktop computers for a much lower price, then this could erode the value proposition of all-flash storage setups in some cases, potentially slowing the shift from hard disk drives to solid state drives in desktop personal computers.The losers would be vendors of solid state drives, as Optane Cache + hard disk drive could reduce demand for traditional flash-based solid state drives.A big caveatThere have been lots of schemes like what Intel is proposing with its Optane caches done in the past, so this isn't exactly new. Hard disk drive makers have (and in some cases still do) offer hard disk drives with small NAND flash caches built in to try to deliver performance that's close to that of pure solid state drives.In 2011, Intel's Z68 desktop platform included a technology called Smart Response Technology (SRT) that allowed users to pair small flash-based storage drives with large hard disk drives to try to achieve solid state drive-like speed on the cheap. Per AnandTech's testing, SRT didn't deliver ""the same performance as a large dedicated [solid state drive]"" but it could allow users to ""turn any hard drive into a much higher performing storage device.""What could potentially make the Optane-based version of this concept more interesting than previous efforts is that instead of pairing a small NAND-flash based solid state drive with a large hard disk drive, Intel is pairing Optane technology (which Intel says is much faster than NAND flash-based drives) with hard disk drives to try to get NAND-flash solid state drive-like performance.It'll be interesting to see how this technology fares in the real world and, perhaps more importantly, if system builders and consumers ultimately adopt it."
Why Western Digital Corp. Shares Soared in January,"Feb 13, 2017 at 6:17PM","What happenedShares of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) rose 17.3% in January of 2017, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.So whatThe digital storage specialist quietly gained about 7% in the first three weeks of January on reports that Western Digital might buy Toshiba's (NASDAQOTH:TOSBF) semiconductor business. Then, sector rival Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) reported stellar earnings, taking Western Digital along for a 7% overnight gain. Western Digital's own results, published the next day, also exceeded analyst expectations, but the good news had already been priced in due to Seagate's strong market signals.IMAGE SOURCE: WESTERN DIGITAL.Now whatIn January's second-quarter report, Western Digital saw strong demand for large-capacity hard drives and all of its solid state drives (SSDs) based on flash memory chips. Western Digital increased its presence in both of these markets via strategic acquisitions of Hitachi's enterprise storage division and SSD specialist SanDisk. I'd be surprised to see any further buyout plays in the next few quarters, as the current product portfolio seems perfectly tailored for the current and near market trends. As for the rumored Toshiba deal, the two companies have been partnering for years. The Japanese technology giant is in dire need of cash, and could ask Western Digital to take a larger ownership stake in their joint ventures, but private equity firms would be the more logical spinoff target there.Long story short, Western Digital is unlikely to rock the boat very hard at the moment -- the current business plan is already A-OK.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

These Are the 10 Highest Dividend-Yielding Stocks -- But Are They Worth the Risk?,"Mar 10, 2017 at 12:24PM","Income investors love high dividend yielding stocks, and companies like Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), and Welltower (NYSE:WELL) have some of the highest dividend yields in the market. Yet rather than just going out and purchasing shares of the top 10 dividend yielding stocks that you'll find below, you need to consider whether those stocks are likely to stay on the list in the months and years to come.The top 10 yields in the S&P 500Below, you'll find the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the S&P 500 as of March 8:StockDividend YieldFrontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR)14.6%CenturyLink9.2%Iron Mountain6.1%Mattel6%Staples5.3%Seagate Technology5.2%Kohl's5%Welltower5%Macy's (NYSE:M)4.8%Ford4.7%DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE.When you consider what this list looked like just a few short months ago, the most obvious change is the dramatic increase in the yield of Frontier Communications. Shares of the telecommunications company have fallen in light of ongoing challenges with its integration of wireline acquisitions in California, Texas, and Florida, and investors are increasingly nervous about Frontier's ability to grow as quickly as they had previously thought. Yet the company remains committed to its current dividend, and so the share-price decline has boosted the yield despite no change in the underlying dividend payment.Dealing with retail woesThe best-represented sector on the S&P 500 high dividend yield list is retail, and a lot of the stocks that show up here have faced major difficulties. In the office supply space, Staples failed to gain approval for its merger with remaining rival Office Depot, and that left the company vulnerable to competition from online-only retailers and the cost advantages that they enjoy. Despite suffering losses, Staples continues to make its dividend payouts, and investors are hopeful that the company can sustain its current payout level for the foreseeable future.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Meanwhile, department store retailers are also paying attractive yields. Both Kohl's and Macy's have announced substantial numbers of store closings in recent years, with closures coming in several waves for many department store chains. Yet even with the cost-cutting moves, holiday results for Macy's and Kohl's this past year were particularly weak, and there's no sign of any imminent bounce for the department stores going forward. As with Staples, online competition is eating into the business of mall-based retail giants, and even the lure of a more tactile shopping experience hasn't been enough to drive traffic. In the long run, companies won't be able to sustain their dividend payouts if they can't reach some viable level of operations that produces sufficient sales and ample profit.Other high-yielding stocksOutside retail, the other stocks listed above have had mixed performance. For Mattel, terrible fourth-quarter performance sent the stock down 20%, and that lifted the yield to its current level above 6%. Some fear that an earnings shortfall suggests an imminent dividend cut. Ford's situation is less dire, as only a large pension-related charge was responsible for recent losses that hid strong fundamental performance throughout much of the automaker's business.On the other hand, Iron Mountain has paid an impressive dividend for a while, with a strong portfolio of properties that provide specialized storage services. Iron Mountain's specialty is information protection and records management, and it has done a good job of leading that niche market. Similarly, Seagate Technology has recently seen its shares recover in light of improving price conditions in the memory market and a resurgence of interest in storage to assist with data analytics and cloud computing applications.Will mergers solve problems?Consolidation is one area in which some companies find ways to remedy their financial issues. It isn't always successful, but sometimes it can create economies of scale that are beneficial.For instance, late last year, CenturyLink said it would combine with Level 3 Communications (NYSE:LVLT) in a transaction valued at $34 billion. The companies anticipated that the deal would produce annual synergies of about $975 million, and CenturyLink said it expected to maintain its current dividend rate even after the deal was complete. Indeed, if the merger is accretive to free cash flow within the first year following closing -- as CenturyLink expects -- then it could make it easier for the telecom giant to sustain dividends going forward.For senior healthcare-oriented real estate investment trust Welltower, acquisitions have been essential to drive growth. With moves like its purchase of a $1.15 billion senior housing portfolio from Vintage Senior Living late last year, Welltower hopes gradually to build up its size and keep generating the income it needs in order to fund its distributions.Overall, the companies that appear on this list of highest-yielding dividend stocks have their share of obstacles to overcome before they can eliminate the risks they face. As long as you go forward knowing the risks involved, the decision is yours whether the rewards outweigh the risks in adding these and similar stocks to your portfolio."
Why Kadant Stock Jumped 18% This Morning,"May 3, 2017 at 1:28PM","What happenedShares of paper recycling equipment-maker Kadant (NYSE:KAI) jumped more than 18% in early Wednesday trading before giving back about half its gains as the day continued. Kadant shares remained up 8.4% as of 1 p.m. EDT.So whatKadant beat expectations in its fiscal Q1 2017 earnings report, released after close of trading on Tuesday. The company reported earnings of $0.80 per share -- versus expectations for only $0.64 -- on sales of $102.9 million. Analysts had forecast only $99.3 million.Kadant's earnings were up 29% year over year in Q1, despite revenue gains of only 7%. Kadant expanded its operating profit margin by 120 basis points, to 11.7%, which helped explain why profits grew so much faster than revenues. Also, Uncle Sam took a smaller tax bite out of Kadant's profits this quarter than it did one year ago, which helped Kadant further pad its bottom line.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Now whatPeering into the future, Kadant CEO Jonathan Painter predicted that ""excellent operating metrics, a robust parts and consumables business, and strong bookings momentum"" have positioned the company to reap anywhere from $427 million to $437 million in revenues this year, while profits are expected to range between $3.27 and $3.37 per share -- $0.14 better than previously predicted.Granted, Kadant just finished reporting an earnings beat worth $0.16, so management's prediction of $0.14 more in profits this year appears to suggest that some of the profit Kadant planned to earn later in the year shifted forward into Q1, instead. But some is not all, and based on guidance, it still appears that 2017 will be a strong year for Kadant.No wonder investors are applauding.10 stocks we like better than KadantWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The 10 Highest-Yielding Dividend Stocks on the S&P 500 in May -- Which Are the Best Buys?,"May 7, 2017 at 7:22AM","The average stock on the S&P 500 pays a dividend yield of just under 2% as of May 2017, which is not exactly a thrilling payout for most income-seeking investors. However, there are some stocks on the index that have much higher dividends. Let's look at the 10 highest-paying stocks on the S&P 500 and see whether any of them are worth buying.CompanySymbolRecent Share PriceDividend YieldCenturyLinkCTL$25.538.4%MattelMAT$21.996.8%Iron MountainIRM$34.936.3%Seagate TechnologySTX$42.026%Kohl's CorporationKSS$38.175.6%Kimco Realty CorpKIM$20.405.3%Ford Motor CoF$11.475.2%Macy'sM$28.725.2%Verizon CommunicationsVZ$45.965%AT&TT$39.235%TABLE IS AUTHOR'S OWN. SHARE PRICES AND DIVIDEND YIELDS CURRENT AS OF MAY 1, 2017.You should be wary of some of these stocksThere are certainly some stocks on this list whose dividends are too good to be true. The top payer, telecom company CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL), is a prime example.A stock's payout ratio tells us how much of the company's earnings are being paid out as dividends. Lower is better, and a payout ratio in excess of 100% implies that the company is paying out more than it makes, and therefore the dividend might be unsustainable.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Well, CenturyLink pays dividends at a rate of $2.16 per year, but analysts are only calling for earnings of $2.16 in 2017 -- which means the company's payout ratio is forecast to be exactly 100%. What's more, earnings are expected to drop to $2.09 next year. This is a little too high for comfort.Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) looks even worse from a dividend safety standpoint. The company pays out $1.52 annually, but earned just $1.06 per share in 2016, for a sky-high payout ratio of 143%. Mattel also reported disappointing first-quarter results, and I wouldn't be surprised to see a dividend cut in the not-too-distant future.There are some good choices on this listBefore you get discouraged, I'll say that the majority of the dividend stocks on this list have pretty safe payouts. In fact, there are some that I'd call excellent long-term investments.Specifically, I love the two real estate investment trusts (REITs) on the list, Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) and Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM), and I actually own the former in my portfolio. By definition, REITs are supposed to pay out a high percentage of their earnings to maintain their tax benefits, so it's only natural that a couple of REITs made the top 10.Iron Mountain is a leader in records storage and security, and you can read my thorough discussion of why I like the company as a long-term investment here. Kimco is a retail REIT that specializes in shopping center properties anchored by defensive retail tenants such as TJX Companies, Wal-Mart, and Dollar Tree, and it has a fantastic track record of delivering market-beating performance and strong dividend growth.To name a couple more, Ford (NYSE:F) trades at an incredibly cheap valuation of just 7.4 times forward earnings, which are expected to cover the company's dividend more than 2.5 times over. Most analysts are expecting automaker earnings to fall significantly in the coming years, but Ford's low payout ratio should provide protection from a drop in profits. And Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) are excellent income investments with consistent earnings and low volatility.The Foolish bottom lineA high dividend all by itself isn't necessarily a good or bad thing. As we've seen, some of the stocks on this list don't even earn enough money to cover their dividend payments, while others earn more than enough to sustain their payouts and reward shareholders for years to come.The bottom line is that any dividend is only as strong as the company paying it, so be sure to do a little digging before diving in to any of these high-dividend S&P 500 stocks.10 stocks we like better than MattelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Bargain Stocks You Can Buy Today,"Feb 16, 2017 at 8:39AM","It's getting harder and harder to find bargain stocks today. The S&P 500 -- when including dividends -- has quadrupled since the nadir of the Great Recession in 2009. The past year alone has seen a jump of 27%, and analysts the world over are starting to wonder when the most recent ""Trump Bump"" will come to an end.While there's no telling where the macroeconomic picture is headed in the short run, there are still deals to be had. You just need to know where to look. Today, you'll see why Ford (NYSE:F), CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are all bargain stocks you can buy today. And, no, the inclusion of Facebook is not a typo.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Yes, Facebook is a bargainLet's start with what is probably the most controversial of these three picks: Facebook. Yes, the stock is up almost 550% since mid-2012. No, it does not offer a dividend. And, yes, it is currently trading for 38 times earnings.But I would argue that sometimes, we underpay for the world's greatest companies. I would say that Facebook probably deserves an even higher multiple, and that its stock is a bargain today.The most important thing to recognize is that the stock has a huge moat. The network effect is one of the most powerful forces in business: with each additional person joining Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp, those who aren't registered on the platform are further incentivized to join.It's a virtuous cycle that not only keeps the company's list of users growing, but allows for all of the content we get on Facebook to be provided for absolutely free. Think about that for a moment. Imagine if Netflix never had to pay a dime for its shows, original or otherwise.Don't get me started on the room for growth internationally. While North America accounts for just 15% of all users, it contributes over half of the revenue. The average revenue per user in other parts of the world lag considerably.  IMAGE SOURCE: FACEBOOK.  North America might always be the biggest contributor, but that's OK. The others still have lots of room to mature. Developing economies are slowly but surely moving toward digital advertising as well. That kind of dynamic, coupled with the fact that it's a mission-driven organization, with a founder/CEO with tons of skin in the game, leads me to believe that today's price tag of just 25 times future earnings is very cheap.If you're truly long term, Ford's dividend alone is worth the buyHere's the long and short of what's happening with Ford right now. Since the Great Recession, the world has been on a car-buying spree that's helped the company's stock return over 600% -- including dividends -- since the nadir of 2008. But investors are worried that the cycle is turning against Ford, and that we'll soon see a lull in car buying.That helps explain why the company's stock trades for just seven times earnings and free cash flow. Already, we're starting to see that some of those worries aren't completely unfounded: Sales have slowed in one of the company's biggest growth markets -- China -- and Ford has slowed production stateside.But it's those very same production cuts that should be so encouraging. While Ford avoided government bailouts nine years ago, it was lack of fiscal restraint that led the entire industry to the brink. The company's decision to temporarily idle production at certain plants is the kind of decision that should keep the company, and its dividend, safe.Speaking of the dividend, that's a huge reason to buy the company. While I'm not sure how much capital appreciation investors can expect from Ford stock, the role of the company's 4.8% dividend yield can't be overlooked. In fact, if we look at the last 30 years, Ford's stock has advanced 180% -- only 3.5% per year. But when we throw dividend reinvestment into the mix, the returns increase almost tenfold.F TOTAL RETURN PRICE DATA BY YCHARTS.Fellow Fool John Rosevear recently broke down how safe Ford's dividend is, considering how wonky the numbers can get because of the company's Ford Credit arm. His conclusion: ""No company's dividend is ever 100% completely safe. But Ford shareholders need not lie awake at night worrying about theirs, even if the U.S. economy slips.""Don't forget this corner store-turned-health companyFinally, we have CVS. Most non-investors likely look at the company as a convenience store. But that overlooks a key business segment: prescription-drug fulfillment. Don't be misled -- this is big business.Over the past year, two major pharmacy accounts -- Prime Therapeutics and Tricare -- decided to leave CVS in favor of Walgreens Boots Alliance. That helps explain why shares now trade for just 13 times earnings and only 10 times free cash flow.Indeed, the immediate future could be painful for shareholders. The aforementioned defections plus uncertainty surrounding the future of the Affordable Care Act and drug prices in general -- under the Trump administration -- have management sounding cautious. Earnings are only expected to increase 4% next year, and free cash flow could fall as much as 25%. But as with Ford, we can't ignore CVS' dividend. Currently yielding 2.6%, CVS should have no trouble paying it in the future. Over the past year, only 24% of free cash flow had to be used to pay the dividend. Even in a worst-case scenario for 2017, the dividend would only eat up 30% of free cash flow.And this company is an absolute cash machine. Take a look at trends in both free cash flow and the growth of the company's dividend over time.CVS As a Cash MachineCreate column chartsFor long-term shareholders who want to buy in on a company experiencing short-term pain, I think CVS is a bargain today.And lest you think I don't have skin in the game with any of these three bargains, Facebook is my second-largest holding personally, while CVS and Ford are both outperform picks on my CAPS profile, which you can see here.10 stocks we like better than CVS HealthWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Fabrinet Stock Popped Today,"May 9, 2017 at 7:45PM","What happenedShares of Fabrinet (NYSE:FN) popped as much as 12.7% early Tuesday and then settled to close up 8.3% after the advanced optical packaging company announced strong fiscal third-quarter 2017 results.So whatQuarterly revenue rose 46.2% year over year to $366.8 million and translated to 46.6% growth in adjusted net income to $30.5 million. Adjusted net income per share increased 42.9%, to $0.80. By comparison -- and keeping in mind that adjusted earnings included a foreign exchange loss of $3.7 million, or $0.10 per share -- analysts' consensus estimates predicted adjusted earnings of $0.88 per share on lower revenue of $362.2 million. IMAGE SOURCE: FABRINETFabrinet CEO Tom Mitchell stated:We had a strong third quarter, with revenue that exceeded our guidance range and grew 46% from a year ago. We are benefiting from growth in a variety of existing customer programs that are further supported by new business. Our new facility in Chonburi, Thailand, and our new product introduction facilities in Santa Clara, Calif., and the U.K. are also making important contributions that we expect to expand as we look ahead.Now whatFor the current (fiscal fourth) quarter, Fabrinet expects revneue of $361 million to $365 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.82 to $0.84. Curiously, both ranges fell below investors' expectations for fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $371 million and adjusted earnings of $0.88 per share. Of course, given Fabrinet's relative outperformance in fiscal Q3, this doesn't rule out the possibility that it's once again under-promising with the aim of over-delivering. Fabrinet's quarter also helped alleviate fears that it would feel the brunt of industry slowdowns in China. So with shares still down more than 16% over the past three months as those fears had intensified leading up to today's report, it's no surprise to see Fabrinet stock rebounding today. 10 stocks we like better than FabrinetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"If You're Bullish on the Trump Economy, This Is the Stock for You","Mar 13, 2017 at 7:19PM","The election of President Donald Trump has been kind to the stock market.Since Election Day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has jumped 13.8%, the Nasdaq is up 12.4%, and the S&P 500 has gained 10.5%.Among the winners have been cyclical stocks like banks, which are expected to benefit from looser financial regulations and a potential increase in borrowing, and industrial stocks have generally outperformed, but one stock stands head and shoulders above the rest.IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL.United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI) has soared 63.8% in the four months since the election, making it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500. As a specialist in renting construction equipment, it seems clear why United Rentals has rallied following Donald Trump's election. Investors are bullish that Trump will get an infrastructure bill passed, which would be a boon for United Rentals and other construction companies. Since Trump is himself a real estate developer, the market also likely expects him to look kindly on the industry.Since the election, United Rentals' gains have come mostly from two separate surges. The first came on the days following the election, and the other followed a strong fourth-quarter earnings report and news of an acquisition.URI DATA BY YCHARTS.United Rentals was one of several construction companies that surged in the week following the election, as peers like Tutor Perini and AECOM Industries also skyrocketed.URI DATA BY YCHARTS.Then, in January, United Rentals posted earnings per share of $2.67 on estimates of $2.24, though revenue growth was unchanged, at $1.523 billion. However, adjusted EPS increased from $2.19 to $2.67 as gross margin improved. CEO Michael Kneeland credited ""broad-based demand"" for the improvement in profits.Separately, United Rentals also announced that it acquired NES Rentals Holdings for $965 million. NES is one of the 10 largest equipment rental companies, and it will help United further penetrate strategically important regions in the U.S. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter and be accretive to earnings, though it has not yet updated its guidance. What the future holds for United RentalsWith a beta of 2.9, United Rentals is highly sensitive to the macroeconomic environment. That figure signals that the stock tends to be nearly three times as volatile as the overall market, much like the rest of the construction industry, which booms and busts according to the greater economy.In the recent earnings call, CEO Kneeland said he sees demand trending up in the current year, and noted, ""there's obvious industry optimism about the focus of the new administration."" However, he expressed some cautiousness, saying, ""In our opinion, it's too early to call. If a government spending stimulates construction, it will be incremental to a cycle that we already see as positive for our business."" Trump has promised a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, and though it's still unclear if such a bill will get passed, infrastructure improvement seemed to be the Trump proposal that Democrats most supported earlier in the year.Such a bill would likely be a boon for rentals companies like United Rentals who rely on gaps in the market between supply and demand, and a sudden spike in government funding would seem to create such an event.At this point, the Trump administration is only seven weeks old, and it's unclear if it will be able to carry objectives, or if the market will continue to move higher on the belief that the administration will be good for business.But if the rally does continue and the Trump economy booms, United Rentals, which still only trades for a P/E of 19, figures to be a big winner.10 stocks we like better than United RentalsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Will Double-Take Fuel Carbonite Growth?,"May 11, 2017 at 6:52PM","Carbonite Inc. (NASDAQ:CARB) acquired Double-Take Software in January of this year. As a user of Carbonite's automated backup product, the purchase intrigued me and I wanted to take a look at whether the stock would make a good investment. When I began to look into it and found that the stock had doubled in the past 12 months, my curiosity was piqued, and my research began.CARB DATA BY YCHARTSWhat is Carbonite's business?Carbonite makes an automated backup solution that is sold to consumers, like me, as well as to small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs). If Murphy's Law strikes and data is lost, it can typically be recovered in a matter of hours. For some, taking a few hours to do a data recovery is not a major problem. There are many businesses, though, that need to have a near real-time recovery solution to keep the business up and running when a data loss occurs.To solve this problem of near-time recovery, Carbonite offers a hybrid solution that consists of a hardware backup product for the more urgently needed files, and cloud backup for files that would not need instant recovery if data was temporarily disrupted.By buying Double-Take, Carbonite acquires a fully cloud-based near-time backup solution. This should expand Carbonite's business beyond businesses that were not interested in a hybrid solution, or customers who may want to upgrade to a completely cloud-based backup solution and ditch the hardware associated with the hybrid product. It also provides it with a much larger selection of products customers can use for system migration and real-time application and data replication.Image source: Getty Images.Why did the stock more than double?In December 2015, Carbonite announced it was buying a product line called EVault from Seagate Technology PLC to help the company expand its hybrid backup business in the SMB market. The company paid $14 million in cash and said the deal would be accretive in one year and double the addressable SMB market for the company. Carbonite then went on to have a banner year in 2016, growing its SMB business bookings by 128%, as is shown in the table below.Metric 2015  2016 Growth (YOY)Consumer bookings $89.6 million $84.9 million (5%)SMB bookings $54.5 million $124.4 million 128%Total bookings $144.1 million $209.3 million 45%DATA SOURCE: CARBONITE 2016 10K. YOY = YEAR OVER YEAR. Since the Dec. 16, 2015, announcement of the purchase, Carbonite's stock has risen roughly 120%. In 2016 the company grew its total bookings by 45% which is a big factor in why the stock went up 70% last year.Will this company double again?Although the acquisition of Double-Take looks like a good strategic fit, it cost the company $65.5 million, a lot more than EVault, and does not appear to have a similarly immediate impact on growth in 2017. The chart below shows management's earnings guidance for 2017 along with the contribution from the Double-Take acquisition.Metric 2016 Earnings/Share  2017 Earnings/Share Guidance Growth at Midpoint of Guidance (YOY) Double-Take's Contribution to Earnings/Share Guidance Growth at Midpoint of Guidance Not Including Double-Take (YOY)Non- GAAP EPS $0.60 $0.72-$0.80 27% $0.08-$0.12 10%DATA SOURCE: CARBONITE FULL-YEAR 2016 PRESENTATION. YOY = YEAR OVER YEAR. When the growth attributed to the Double-Take acquisition is removed from the guidance, it is worth noting that the company is guiding to 10% adjusted earnings growth. This tells us the growth from buying EVault is not going to repeat itself and its addition to Carbonite made for easy comparisons on a YOY basis in 2016.The bookings guidance is even more revealing as it shows the target SMB market only growing at 12% YOY without Double-Take and 32% including Double-Take. This is much less than the 128% SMB bookings growth the company experienced in 2016 after it bought EVault and as a result we cannot expect the same type of increase in the stock's price that occurred last year.Metric 2015  2016 Growth (YOY) 2017 Guidance Double-Take's Contribution at Midpoint of Guidance Growth at Midpoint (YOY) Growth Without Double-Take ContributionConsumer bookings $89.6 million $84.9 million (5%) $76.4 million-$84.9 million 0 (5%) (5%)SMB bookings $54.5 million $124.4 million 128% $158.6 million-$170.2 million $25 million 32% 12%Total bookings $144.1 million $209.3 million 45%  $235.0 million- $255.1 million $25 million 17% 5%DATA SOURCE: CARBONITE. CHART BY AUTHOR. YOY = YEAR OVER YEAR. Operational efficiencies may improveIt is quite possible that the Double-Take solution may allow the company to exceed its own expectations for growth. In addition, I want to see if Carbonite achieves synergistic cost reductions from integrating the two companies. This would be shown as greater operational efficiency.The chart below shows that the company has been achieving success in this area, with costs coming down as a percentage of revenue prior to the Double-Take acquisition.IMAGE SOURCE: CARBONITE.Foolish conclusionsIn light of the slowing rate of growth in the company's SMB business, I'll pass on the stock for now and will continue to monitor the company to see if it realizes higher growth than management is projecting. The possibility of improved operational efficiency could also translate into greater-than-expected profits, which may result in the stock going higher.I like the company's product and its strategic direction, but for now, it remains on my watchlist.10 stocks we like better than CarboniteWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

HP Inc. Stock Upgraded: What You Need to Know,"Apr 13, 2017 at 8:00AM","Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...It's been a good couple of months for investors in personal computer parts suppliers. So far, we've seen shares of Micron, Seagate, and Western Digital -- all makers of computer solid state and hard disk drives -- upgraded with buy ratings. And the reasons Wall Street gives are encouraging: Demand is high and supplies are tightening for solid state memory. And that implies (and other data support the thesis) that demand for personal computers is finally stabilizing.Conclusion: The PC industry is coming back to life -- and according to Citigroup, that's good news for HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ).Here are three things you need to know about that.ARE PC SALES MAKING A COMEBACK? CITI -- AND HP INVESTORS -- HOPE SO. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.1. Upgrading HPYesterday, in an upgrade heard round the world, Citigroup announced it is raising its recommendation on HP stock from neutral to buy. As reported on TheFly.com yesterday, Citi sees ""better than expected PC data points"" and believes that HP's printer ink business is also beginning to stabilize.This could lead analysts to revise their earnings targets for HP stock higher, which would naturally result in a higher stock price as well. Citi estimates HP could hit $20 within a year -- about an 11% improvement from the current stock price. Tack on a respectable 3.1% dividend yield, and that makes for a potential 14% profit for new buyers of HP stock.2. More profits, more market shareAnd that's not all. Digging deeper into Citi's analysis of HP stock, StreetInsider.com says that not only is the PC market improving, but HP is capturing a bigger share of that market. Combining improved profit margins with more sales, Citi argues that HP could earn as much as $1.64 per share this year ($0.05 more than previously postulated). This could be followed by earnings of $1.75 in 2018, and perhaps $1.79 in 2019, if all goes well.Thus, HP's current stock price of $18 and change values the company at roughly 10 times 2019 earnings -- and to Citigroup, that's good enough to merit a buy rating. On the other hand, given that even Citi is only predicting about 4% to 5% annualized sales growth for HP, investors may wonder if HP stock is really worth paying 10 times earnings two years out -- earnings that may or may not happen. (For the record, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, most analysts think HP will only be earning $1.60 in 2019.)3. Trouble in paradiseAnd for that matter, is business really as good as Citigroup says? Not all experts think so. For example, earlier this week, tech-watcher Gartner published a report that shows worldwide PC shipments declining 2.4% year over year in Q1. Gartner noted, furthermore, that this was the first time PC makers shipped fewer than 63 million units in a full quarter -- since 2007!Fact is, Gartner reports that the only segment of the PC market that is growing today is purchases of PCs by businesses -- and even this growth is only ""modest."" Consumer purchases of personal computers continue to decline, as individuals make do with older PCs rather than upgrading to fancier versions. At the same time, some consumers, says Gartner, have abandoned PCs altogether, and do their computing today on tablets and smartphones instead.What it means for investorsGartner's conclusion doesn't necessarily contradict Citigroup's upgrade of HP stock, but it does refine it a bit -- and this could be important for investors to bear in mind. Says Gartner, with consumer sales growth nonexistent, ""maintaining a strong position in the business market"" is what will be ""critical"" for PC makers. Emphasizing the point, Gartner believes PC industry investing may become less a matter of finding ""winners,"" and more one of just finding ""survivors.""Who will those survivors be? Gartner argues that only the top three vendors of PCs have much of a chance of coming out of this downturn alive. That means Lenovo in China, privately held Dell, and -- the only one of the three that's actually easy to invest in -- HP. Unless PC sales suddenly and magically improve, everyone else, warns Gartner, could be forced out of the PC market ""in the next five years.""So what's the upshot for investors? Gartner believes HP will be one of only a small handful of survivors remaining in the PC market five years from now. That may be enough to merit a buy rating, if you believe Citi's prediction of 4% to 5% growth -- and if that's fast enough growth for you.For me, it's not, and that's why I'll be passing on this particular buy recommendation.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Washington's The Washington Companies group has apparently been talking with Dominion Diamond, about taking over the company, for some months. Dominion hasn't been totally averse to the deal, but it had asked Washington to refrain from making public proclamations regarding the negotiations. That silence ended yesterday, when Washington decided to enlist shareholder support for its offer of $13.50 a share to acquire the company -- making its offer public and upsetting Dominion to no end.Dominion quickly responded with a statement of its own, dismissing the bid as ""generic"" and ""boilerplate,"" blasting Washington as lacking ""experience in the highly specialized diamond mining and marketing industry,"" and calling its offer ""opportunistic."" (Dominion shares sold for more than twice their pre-weekend sub-$9 share price as recently as two years ago).THE WASHINGTON COMPANIES THINK THEIR OFFER TO BUY DOMINION DIAMOND IS RATHER SPARKLY. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Now whatIn short, Dominion Diamond is not terribly enthused with the offer, and there's no guarantee that any acquisition will happen, at any price. Nevertheless, The Washington Companies are persisting in their pursuit of the company, even suggesting they might propose ""an increased offer price"" if Dominion agrees to permit them to conduct due diligence on its business. So a deal might result at some point, and perhaps at an even higher price than Washington have already offered. (In fact, Dominion may have been positioning itself to argue for a higher price when, late last week, it issued new guidance predicting its sales will surge more than 60% in the new year).That guidance notwithstanding, when you consider that Dominion Diamond's last earnings report featured a near-30% drop in revenues, and that the company has been losing money for more than a year, the prospect of a huge premium to last week's share price probably looks pretty attractive to investors today. Now that the negotiations are public, don't be surprised if the pressure increases on management to go ahead and make a deal.10 stocks we like better than Dominion Diamond CorporationWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why CryoLife Inc. Jumped Higher,"Apr 27, 2017 at 1:20PM","What happenedCryoLife (NYSE:CRY) is up 10.5% at 12:37 p.m. EDT after announcing solid first-quarter earnings.So whatRevenue increased 5% year over year in the first quarter, which was driven by growth in sales of the On-X aortic heart valve and tissue products. CryoLife has made a strategic decision to focus on certain markets, so revenue was hurt by the absence of sales of its HeRO and ProCol products, which it sold off last year, and a decrease in TMR revenues, but the strategy seems to be paying off.Adjusted earnings were flat year over year at $3.2 million in the first quarter of this year and last, although there are more shares outstanding now, so on a per-share basis, adjusted earnings fell $0.01 to $0.09 per share. The year-over-year increase in revenue didn't fall to the bottom line because CryoLife spent more on research and development than it did in the year-ago quarter, which is an investment in the future.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Now whatManagement reiterated its guidance for the year with expectations for adjusted product revenue and tissue processing revenue to both produce year-over-year grow in the mid-single digits. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the $0.40 to $0.43 range, so management is predicting that earnings will pick up a little as the year progresses.Investors will get a look at how well On-X might be able to drive CroyLife's sales higher next month at the American Association for Thoracic Surgery meeting, where the company's academic collaborator will present data from the PROACT clinical trial."
Should You Buy Seagate After its First Quarter Surprise?,"Oct 27, 2017 at 5:08PM","Seagate Technology's (NASDAQ:STX) stock rallied by about 13% after the hard drive maker posted better-than-expected first quarter earnings on Oct. 23. But even after that pop, Seagate's stock remains down about 25% over the past six months.Seagate's headline numbers were unremarkable, but they still beat analyst expectations. Its revenue fell 6% annually to $2.63 billion, topping estimates by $110 million. Non-GAAP earnings slipped 3% to $0.96 per share, but also beat expectations by $0.11.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.But if we dig deeper into Seagate's quarter, we'll understand why buyers came back to this unloved stock. Let's examine the bullish catalysts to see if the stock is a worthy buy at current prices.Understanding Seagate's predicamentSeagate is the second largest maker of platter-based HDDs (hard disk drives) in the world after Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). This market is a tough one for two reasons -- it's heavily commoditized, and HDDs are gradually being displaced by SSDs (solid state drives).SSDs store data on NAND flash memory chips instead of platters, so they're smaller, faster, less prone to damage, and consume less power. This makes them ideal for high-end laptops, PCs, and data centers. SSDs are pricier on a per gigabyte basis, but many industry analysts believe that they'll achieve price parity with HDDs within the next few years.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.To escape that inevitable downturn, Western Digital acquired flash memory and SSD maker SanDisk for nearly $19 billion last year. That was a smart move, since surging NAND prices lifted SanDisk's revenue and offset WD's softer sales of traditional HDDs.Seagate acquired some NAND chips through its acquisition of Samsung's  HDD unit and partnerships with Micron and SK Hynix. It was also part of the consortium, led by Bain Capital and SK Hynix, which recently agreed to buy Toshiba's memory chipmaking business for $18 billion.However, none of those deals helped it keep pace with market leaders Samsung and Western Digital, which together control over half of the entire SSD market. Seagate's partners, Micron, SK Hynix, and Toshiba, each control single-digit shares of that market.Focusing on the growing need for high-capacity HDDsWithout a meaningful foothold in the SSD market, Seagate focused on boosting the capacity of its existing HDDs for enterprise customers. The main idea is that while enterprise HDDs will never beat SSDs in terms of performance, demand for high-capacity HDDs should keep rising as a surge in data from streaming media, apps, and other cloud services causes data center operators to prioritize capacity over raw speed.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.That's precisely what we saw during the first quarter, as Seagate's HDD shipments rose 5% annually and its average capacity per hard drive rose 12% to 1.9 terabytes per drive. However, its average selling price still fell three dollars to $64, and its non-GAAP gross margin dipped from 29.5% to 29% -- but those declines came in lighter than expected.Analysts expect Seagate's revenue and earnings to respectively slip 4% and 3% this year, so its turnaround won't take shape anytime soon. But its numbers are stabilizing, and the company isn't sitting idly by as HDDs become obsolete. Instead, it's expanding its portfolio with its aforementioned NAND partnerships, which could eventually help it gain a bigger slice of the SSD market.Seagate could also fare better than Western Digital if NAND prices, which are approaching a cyclical high, crash. That's because Seagate purchases NAND chips from partners instead of directly selling them like SanDisk, so lower NAND prices would boost its margins instead of crushing them.What about the valuations and dividends?Seagate looks fairly cheap at 11 times next year's earnings. But Western Digital has a lower forward P/E of 7 thanks to the accretive boost from its SanDisk acquisition.As for the dividend, Seagate's forward yield of 6.4% is much higher than WD's 2.3% yield. Seagate spent just 73% of its earnings and 38% of its free cash flow on that payout over the past 12 months, so its high yield shouldn't be considered a red flag.So is it time to buy Seagate?Seagate's first quarter numbers reveal that its core business is stabilizing, and that the bearish thesis of SSDs completely wiping out HDDs might be overblown. Looking ahead, Seagate could tread water with higher capacity HDDs as it gradually expands into SSDs or hybrid storage solutions.Until that happens, its low valuation and high dividend should also set a floor under the stock. I'm not completely confident that Seagate is returning to growth yet, but these factors indicate that it probably wouldn't hurt to nibble on the stock at current prices.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is Seagate Stock a Sell? 1 Analyst Thinks So,"Jul 13, 2017 at 2:24PM","Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) investors have endured a rough ride this past year. Up an impressive 33% over the past 12 months, shares spiked in January as signs of a resurgent market for PC hard drives began to appear -- then jumped even higher on analyst upgrades in April. The enthusiasm quickly waned, however, and today, Seagate stock is actually trading barely above where it began this year.And one analyst thinks things will get worse before they get better.BARCLAYS MAKES A CASE AGAINST HARD DISK DRIVE MANUFACTURER, SEAGATE -- BUT IT'S HARD TO DISLIKE A STOCK THIS CHEAP. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Barclays downgradesThis morning, British megabank Barclays Capital announced it is pulling its ""equalweight"" rating on Seagate shares, and downgrading Seagate stock to ""underweight."" As StreetInsider.com (requires subscription) explains in a write-up on the re-rating this morning, Barclays believes ""upside for the stock is limited."" The analyst has three main reasons for thinking this way, and two of them involved Seagate rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC).Western Digital could winWestern Digital, as you may have heard, is involved in a high-stakes, $1.1 billion lawsuit with its flash memory partner Toshiba. Toshiba is trying to sell its part of a joint venture between the two companies, but Western Digital is trying to block the sale.Toshiba says Western Digital is engaging in unfair competition with it, and has stolen ""trade secrets."" Litigation is ongoing, but Western Digital has told the court that Toshiba's claims are ""frivolous and without merit."" The litigation hasn't had much effect on Western Digital's stock price (which has surged) so far this year. Barclays' worry with respect to Seagate is that if things go well for Western Digital, that company's shares could outperform Seagate's by an even wider margin, ""de-coupl[ing]"" them from Seagate's valuation, and leaving Seagate shares in the dust.Logically, if that happens, the smart move would be for investors to dump Seagate shares and buy Western Digital instead -- which is just what Barclays seems to be advising.The ""12 TB transition""At the same time, Barclays worries that companies are beginning to transition to buying larger and larger hard drives, specifically 12 terabytes and up. Seagate is preparing to sell 12-, 14-, and even 16-TB hard drives -- but no sooner than next year. Meanwhile, Western Digital has already announced its own hard drives of these sizes. If Western Digital beats Seagate to market with its products, Barclays thinks Seagate could ""miss the 12TB transition, ceding high-margin market share to WD,"" reports StreetInsider.The trouble with Seagate stock, specificallyNor are all of Seagate's problems Western Digital-related. One of the reasons that Seagate stock is up so much over the past year (over 29%), despite its recent relapse, is that its profit margins have been surging as the company cut operating costs. Data from S&P Global Market Intelligence show that Seagate's operating profit margins surged from just 1.8% in Q1 of last year, to 7.6%, then 10.8%, then 13.9% over the ensuing quarters.Last quarter, however, Seagate's operating profit margin slipped back to 11.7%, and this has Barclays worried that ""most of the excess costs at Seagate have been purged from the system."" If profit margin growth stalls, that would remove a big reason for thinking the stock still has upside -- and could give investors even more reason to prefer Western Digital stock over Seagate.The upshot for investorsIs Barclays Capital right about all of the above worries? They certainly sound like valid concerns to me.That said, priced at 16 times earnings and with a projected 19% annual earnings growth rate, it's hard to see Seagate shares as expensive today. The more so when you consider that S&P Global data show Seagate generating $1.5 billion in annual free cash flow -- an amount twice what the company reports as GAAP net income, and a sum that gives Seagate stock a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of just 8.With a cheap share valuation and a 6.3% dividend yield to cushion any further worries about its business, I see a lot of risk already baked into Seagate's share price. Barclays may say it's time to sell it, but at these prices, I still think Seagate stock is a buy.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Seagate Stock Popped 17% Today,"Oct 23, 2017 at 1:23PM","What happenedShares of Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) stock jumped as much is 17.1% in early trading Monday after the company reported fiscal Q1 2018 earnings that handily beat estimates. Analysts had projected that Seagate would earn $0.86 per share in Q1, but it reported pro forma earnings of $0.96 per share -- a dime above consensus. Seagate stock is still up 12.1% as of 12:30 p.m. EDT.SEAGATE'S CASH PROFITS PLUNGED IN Q1, BUT INVESTORS AREN'T GIVING SEAGATE A ""HARD"" TIME OVER THAT. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.So whatAt $2.6 billion for the quarter, Seagate sales were down 6% year over year. Operating expenses, though, slumped 8%. As a result, despite scoring lower revenue for the quarter, Seagate's operating profit actually increased 15%. On the bottom line, net profits were up 8% at $181 million. Per-share diluted profits -- not pro forma -- grew 12% year over year.Now whatNo doubt, Seagate's results could have been worse, given the revenue decline. That said, I am not certain that investors enthusiastic response to the news is entirely appropriate. Although net profits increased, Seagate suffered a steep drop in free cash flow during Q1.Cash from operations of $237 million was cut by more than half once capital expenditures were figured in, resulting in free cash flow of only $113 million. That's compared to last year's Q1, in which Seagate generated $451 million in positive free cash -- a 75% decrease year over year.Granted, at a current valuation of 8.8 times free cash flow, and with analysts projecting 15% annualized long-term growth, Seagate shares look exceedingly cheap. To be cheap, however, Seagate will need to show that it can continue to grow free cash flow at that 15% projected rate. For more on that score, tune in again in three more months."
What to Expect When Seagate Technologies Reports Earnings,"Jul 24, 2017 at 3:23PM","Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) stock got off to an impressive start in 2017 thanks to a terrific fiscal second quarter that encouraged the company to raise its guidance. But things soon started going downhill as the storage specialist failed to deliver in the third quarter after setting high expectations.Seagate shares are down roughly 20% since its quarterly report on April 26 (but up about 4% year to date) in as investors seem to have have lost confidence in the company's ability to deliver on its promises. The company turned  in $2.67 billion in third-quarter revenue after forecasting that it could achieve a figure of almost $2.7 billion.The stock dropped 17% on the day third-quarter earnings were announced even though Seagate beat the bottom-line estimate by three cents. What's in store when Seagate reports fourth-quarter results July 25? Let's take a look.  IMAGE SOURCE: SEAGATE The expectationsAnalysts expect Seagate's revenue to drop 3.2% year over year during the fourth quarter to $2.57 billion, though adjusted earnings are, on average, estimated to increase from $0.69 per share to $0.99 per share thanks to lower costs. Wall Street has dialed down its estimates according to the storage specialist's own  guidance, which calls for revenue between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion but analysts' expectations are a shade higher than Seagate's guidance. Now, it won't be surprising if the company fails to hit the top-line target as the hard-disk drive (HDD) market was affected  by seasonality, forcing Seagate to maintain a lower inventory to keep costs low.Gartner estimates that the worldwide PC market dropped  4.3% during the second quarter of 2017, which corresponds to Seagate's fiscal fourth quarter. By comparison, shipments had improved  0.6% during the first quarter, which clearly indicates that Seagate's unit shipments will decline. But at the same time, Seagate will also get a higher price as the average price per hard disk drive has increased this year, thanks mainly to the shortage of DRAM (dynamic random access memory) and NAND components. However, selling prices could tank as the likes of Samsung start investing  in memory capacity.What next?PC sales have been hurt by the higher prices of components such as DRAM, solid-state drives, and HDDs. A continuation of this trend could lead to lower PC shipments for the rest of the year, which will hurt Seagate's shipments.However, the expected growth in memory capacity won't start  until 2019, which could lead to stronger pricing and help Seagate offset a decline in memory shipments. Additionally, Seagate could find growth in fast-growing areas of the storage market, especially in the enterprise space.For instance, the network-attached storage (NAS) market is expected to grow  at 26% a year until 2020 thanks to an increase in data center storage. Seagate is busy tapping this market by offering NAS solutions that integrate a different number of hard drives into each NAS depending on the customer's requirement.Therefore, Seagate can enhance its sales as it will be able to ship more HDDs into a market that's starting to take off. However, the company's top line will continue to remain challenged in the short run as PC shipments decline. Additionally, the rise of Toshiba in the HDD space has hurt  Seagate, with the former cornering an impressive 24% of the market at the end of 2016.Not surprisingly, analysts expect Seagate's revenue to drop another  3% in the next quarter given the many challenges it is facing. Investors will be watching on July 25 to see what the company has to say."

How Seagate Technology plc Stock Fell 15% in July,"Aug 1, 2017 at 1:28PM","What happenedShares of hard drive maker Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) fell 14.9% in July 2017, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.So whatSeagate posted a fourth-quarter earnings report on July 25, and it wasn't a pretty picture. Revenues landed at $2.4 billion, 7% below the Street's $2.6 billion consensus estimate. Bottom-line earnings fell 6% year over year to stop at $0.65 per share, while analysts were looking for 43% growth. Moreover, longtime CEO Steve Luczo announced his retirement. Seagate shares fell 15% on the news.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Now whatLater that week, archrival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) took a 7% overnight haircut based on disappointing results. Seagate investors had already priced in that pain into the stock, but the dual letdown was at least a clear signal of sectorwide weakness rather than a unique Seagate situation.That being said, both Seagate's and Western Digital's management explained that this should be a temporary drop while demand for data storage remains healthy and growing in the long term. In Seagate's case, the company ran into soft demand for its cloud storage systems and cautious orders from enterprise customers in China.Luczo's retirement was said to be the culmination of a two-year transition process, and new Seagate CEO Dave Mosley should step up from the COO post to hit the ground running on Oct. 1.So there's nothing terribly wrong with Seagate right now, at least if you take the company's management at its word.

1 Analyst Upgraded Seagate Stock. Then Earnings Happened.,"Jul 25, 2017 at 1:24PM","Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...Perhaps Loop Capital thought it was being clever. Heading into Seagate Technology's (NASDAQ:STX) fourth-quarter earnings report, optimism was running high. Wall Street was calling for only $2.6 billion in quarterly sales (a 3% decline from last year), but an amazing $0.99 per share in net profit -- a 43% year over year increase!By all indications, Q4 was shaping up to be a blowout when earnings were released this morning. And so, at 4:30 p.m. EDT yesterday, Loop Capital initiated coverage of Seagate stock with a buy rating and a $50 price target. It was just hours before earnings were due, and Seagate was selling for less than $40 then -- so a good time to book a quick profit on imminent results.For good measure (perhaps they were looking for some pin action after Seagate bowled everyone over), StreetInsider.com reports that Loop also initiated coverage of Seagate rival Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) with the same buy rating and a $140 price target (requires subscription).Now here are three things you need to know about what happened next.INVESTORS IN HARD DISK DRIVE MAKER SEAGATE ARE HAVING A HARD MORNING TODAY. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.1. The best-laid plans of mice and menSurprise! It wasn't what Loop Capital expected would happen. (Nor, to be frank, what I expected, either.)Instead of reporting $0.99 per share in profit, Seagate said it earned only $0.38 per share in Q4. Revenue also missed targets, coming in at just $2.4 billion. Granted, the company qualified that, ""on a non-GAAP basis"" excluding ""certain items"" from its report, earnings would have been $0.65 per share -- but even that number would have missed Wall Street's target by more than 34%.2. Adding insult to injuryThat wasn't the end of the surprises, either. On top of the earnings miss, Seagate announced that CEO Steve Luczo is being promoted out of office, abandoning the CEO's chair and becoming executive chairman (effective Oct. 1) so as to give him more time ""to focus on longer-term shareholder value creation.""Taking over as CEO at Seagate will be current President and Chief Operating Officer Dave Mosley, a 22-year veteran of Seagate -- but in his role as COO, one of the people chiefly responsible for this morning's massive earnings miss.Investors were not amused, and Seagate shares have fallen 15% as of 1:09 p.m. EDT.3. Who saw this coming?Clearly, Seagate's bad news took Wall Street by surprise. But should we have been surprised? Although I disagreed with their call at the time, Barclays Capital actually predicted something very much like what we saw this morning in its downgrade of Seagate stock two weeks ago.Back then, Barclays warned that because Western Digital was beginning sales of 12-, 14-, and even 16-terabyte hard drives this year, while Seagate would not begin selling such huge drives before 2018, Seagate was at risk of ""miss[ing] the 12TB transition, ceding high-margin market share to WD."" Barclays also warned that Seagate's operating profit margins, which had been surging in recent quarters, stumbled in Q3, falling from 13.9% to 11.7%. Barclays' theory was that Seagate had already ""purged"" all of the ""excess costs"" from its business, and had no way to grow margins anymore.Turns out Barclays was right about that. S&P Global Market Intelligence's record of margin trends at Seagate shows that Seagate's operating profit margin in Q4 was a lowly 8.1%, only 50 basis points higher than it achieved in Q4 2016, and a full 360 basis points below Q3 2017.What it means to investorsSo what can investors learn from all this? Well, the first lesson is obvious: The next time you're faced with a situation in which Loop Capital says buy but Barclays says sell -- you might want to listen to Barclays' advice and ignore Loop's.A second lesson: Loop Capital appears to have tried to time the market, sneaking in a quick buy rating on a stock it expected to pop -- but didn't. Instead of emerging a hero, Loop Capital is left with egg on its face. It'll take a long time for Loop to get back to breakeven on this one.But here's perhaps the most important lesson of all: Seagate Technology had a lousy quarter in Q4. Some investors saw it coming, others (including yours truly) did not. But this does not necessarily mean that you should sell Seagate stock just because everyone else is doing so today. Instead, acknowledge that there are risks to investing, and that sometimes things won't work out as you hope they will -- and insist on getting a good, fat margin of safety before you buy into a stock.In my view, Seagate Technology still offers such a margin of safety for long-term investors patient enough to wait out the current storm. Even figuring Q4's awful numbers into the mix, Seagate boasts trailing-12-month net profits of $772 million, and free cash flow twice that -- $1.5 billion. Weighed against a $9.6 billion market capitalization with $2.5 billion in net debt (i.e., an enterprise value of $12.1 billion), that gives Seagate stock an enterprise value-to-free-cash-flow ratio of only 8.1. At this valuation, Seagate only has to grow its profits at about 8% annually over the long term to be fairly priced -- and according to the analysts on S&P Global, Seagate is still expected to grow twice that fast over the long term, this morning's bad news notwithstanding.Loop Capital's hoped-for post-earnings pop did not materialize. But over the long term, Seagate Technology still looks like a very cheap stock.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Things Seagate Technology PLC Management Wants You to Know,"Jul 25, 2017 at 6:30PM","On July 25, hard disk drive manufacturer Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) reported its fourth-quarter earnings. Unfortunately, the results were well below expectations, and shares plummeted in response.As my Foolish colleague Evan Niu explained in his excellent write-up explaining the drop, Seagate's revenue came in at $2.4 billion for the quarter, missing expectations of $2.56 billion, and earnings per share was $0.65, missing consensus of $0.98.IMAGE SOURCE: SEAGATE.Additionally, the company announced a leadership transition. Dr. Dave Mosley, previously president and COO of the company, will take over from Steve Luczo as CEO beginning on Oct. 1, 2017, and Luczo will become executive chairman.Seagate management also hosted a conference call to discuss the results. Here are three items from the call that I found particularly interesting.What drove the miss?Luczo said that the company ""saw strength in the quarter from [its] largest nearline U.S.-based [cloud service provider] customers and relative seasonal demand in the compute and branded markets.""Seagate defines ""nearline applications"" as ""those which require high capacity and energy efficient storage solutions.""""We expect such applications, which include storage for cloud computing, content delivery and backup services, will continue to grow and drive demand for solutions designed with these attributes,"" the company said in its most recent form 10-K filing.Additionally, the company defines ""compute"" applications in its 10-K as ""solutions designed for desktop and mobile compute applications ranging from traditional laptops, tablets and convertible systems.""Continuing with this quarter's results, Luczo said that the previous factors were offset by ""weakness in [Seagate's] enterprise storage customers, including traditional OEM nearline and mission critical demand, China [cloud service provider] nearline demand, and [Seagate's] own Cloud Storage systems business.""""In addition,"" Luczo added, ""there was weakness in the surveillance and [network attached storage] markets due to some intra-quarter channel inventory management.""Short-term versus long-term?Luczo said that the company's revenue results, driven by the above dynamics, ""were approximately 5% below plan.""The executive indicated that ""approximately half"" of the revenue miss came from the company's cloud storage systems business and the other half came from enterprise hard disk drive ""weakness and channel inventory management.""Luczo then explained that ""some of these factors"" -- he cited the China cloud service provider and network attached storage (NAS) issues as examples -- ""are temporal and supply chain related.""In other words, they don't appear to be issues with the underlying markets; it's an issue with Seagate's execution.However, Luczo also conceded that ""some of the OEM revenue declines are more structural.""10 TB and 12 TB ambitions""We continue to ramp our 10TB nearline product and shipped approximately 300,000 units in the June quarter,"" Seagate CFO Dave Morton said.He added that Seagate's ""sales for this capacity point have almost doubled over the last two quarters,"" and that the company is planning to ship a million 10 TB drives in the current quarter.""In addition, our 12TB product shipped for revenue in the June quarter with excellent feedback,"" Morton said. ""And we are confident that our qualification process is competitive.""All told, Morton says that the company expects to capture ""approximately 50% of the exabyte share within the 10 TB and 12 TB market by the end of the calendar year.""10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Why Seagate Technology, Alder Biopharmaceuticals, and Avis Budget Group Slumped Today","Jun 27, 2017 at 5:05PM","The stock market fell on Tuesday, with more extensive losses than investors have seen in quite a while. The Nasdaq Composite fell more than 100 points, or just over 1.6%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials had more modest declines. Negative comments from central bank leaders in the U.S. and Europe added to concerns about the ability of the Trump administration to move forward on its business-friendly domestic agenda, weighing down the market. Certain company-specific news sent some individual stocks down much more sharply, and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), Alder Biopharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALDR), and Avis Budget Group (NASDAQ:CAR) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.Seagate falls in sympathyShares of Seagate Technology declined 7%, following in the footsteps of its main rival in storage devices despite news that ordinarily might have sounded positive. Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) preannounced last night that its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings would be better than it had initially expected. The company cited strong demand for its storage products, especially in the flash-memory and high capacity hard-drive markets. Yet investors seemed to be less than satisfied with the news, and the fact that Western Digital only repeated its full-year outlook rather than boosting it showed some reluctance to project solid growth forward. Western Digital bounced back from most of its losses earlier in the session, but Seagate investors seemed to want even better industry news following a tough period in its most recent quarter back in April.IMAGE SOURCE: SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY.Alder's headache drug might not be a winnerAlder Biopharmaceuticals stock plunged 28% after the company released mixed results from a phase 3 trial of migraine-treatment candidate eptinezumab. Many industry followers were pleased with the study results, because they indicated statistically significant impacts in reducing the number of migraine headaches per month in its patients. However, the magnitude of the benefit wasn't as strong as most were hoping to see, and that could make it difficult for Alder to persuade medical professionals to choose eptinezumab over existing treatments even if it does manage to get approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. If Alder can't demonstrate bigger advantages in its drug, then it will face difficulty dislodging already available treatments from regular use.Avis Budget gives back some gainsFinally, shares of Avis Budget Group dropped 8%. The downward move gave back more than half of yesterday's gains for the car rental company, which soared after announcing a deal to supply fleet support and maintenance to the self-driving car business Waymo. The stock rose yesterday on the idea that a fleet of self-driving cars could be a huge boon for Avis, because it could reposition vehicles to wherever they're needed. Moreover, Waymo sees the benefit of Avis' expertise in maintenance and fleet operations. However, today's drop seems to recognize the amount of competition in the autonomous vehicle space and the potential for problems that could offset some of the positives of the arrangement for Avis.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Why Goldman Sachs, Seagate Technology, and Tenet Healthcare Jumped Today","Dec 12, 2017 at 4:30PM","The stock market continued to climb on Tuesday, with the Dow and S&P 500 moving higher to record levels even as the Nasdaq Composite lagged behind. Investors were generally focused on the beginning of the December meeting of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee, which will conclude on Wednesday with a much-anticipated decision on whether to raise short-term interest rates. Yet Wall Street seem poised for whatever outcome the meeting has, as even a rate hike would serve to confirm the strength of the U.S. economy. Moreover, several major companies managed to gain considerable ground, with sizable percentage increases despite their being among the leaders of their respective fields. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), and Tenet Healthcare (NYSE:THC) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.Goldman gains on Fed, bitcoinGoldman Sachs was a top performer in the Dow on a percentage basis on Tuesday, with shares rising 3% in light of a couple of favorable news items. First, financial stocks in general seem to expect good news from the Fed meeting this week, as higher rates have helped to support spreads between the deposit rates banks pay their deposit customers and the lending rates they charge their borrowers. In addition, Goldman said that it would move forward with plans to clear bitcoin futures trades for some of their clients after looking at the risk profile and other specifications of the contracts. With the investment bank having enjoyed good business results recently, Goldman shareholders are hopeful that it can capitalize on markets going forward.IMAGE SOURCE: GOLDMAN SACHS.Seagate looks at possible labor cutsSeagate Technology stock picked up 4% after the computer storage specialist said it would reduce its workforce by about 500 employees during the first six months of 2018. The move affects just 1% of Seagate's global workforce, but the decision is part of a broader restructuring plan that Seagate is implementing in order to cut costs and boost profitability. New CEO Dave Mosley has helped the company reach record shipment volume recently, and bullish investors want to see a combination of smart cost-cutting and better strategic vision in driving Seagate's business forward.Tenet earns nice words from analystsFinally, shares of Tenet Healthcare gained more than 8%. The hospital operator received favorable comments from analysts at Citi, who upgraded Tenet from neutral to buy amid several similar upgrades of other hospital peers. For Tenet, Citi believes that a combination of strategic moves to sell off assets and a rebound in patient volume should help the company see better bottom-line performance in 2018. Hedge fund Glenview Capital Management's position in Tenet also strongly suggests that the hospital operator is consistently looking at any strategies that it thinks could lead to outperformance for shareholders in the near future."
"How Seagate Technology, Plc. Shares Rose 11.5% in October","Nov 10, 2017 at 5:19AM","What happenedShares of hard drive manufacturer Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) gained 11.5% in October 2017, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. At the heart of this surge, you'll find a surprisingly solid first-quarter earnings report.So whatSeagate's first-quarter sales fell 5.9% year over year to land at $2.63 billion. Adjusted earnings declined 3% to $0.96 per diluted share. While hardly the stuff of growth investors' dreams, both of these figures exceeded Wall Street's consensus estimates at the time by a comfortable margin. Share prices surged as much as 17% higher the next day.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Now whatThe company is riding its portfolio of traditional hard-drive products as hard as possible, because Seagate is a market leader there but a hopelessly trailing also-ran in the healthier SSD storage market. As long as Seagate can defend its chosen niche in low-cost, large-capacity storage devices, I guess that's fine. But it's not an excellent market position for the long term, and it's high time to get a credible SSD strategy going.To that end, Seagate is part of a consortium that's buying Toshiba's (NASDAQOTH:TOSBF) microchip operations, which includes a small stake in the solid-state storage market. But even then, Seagate is only grabbing a small piece of Toshiba's underwhelming market presence and that's not going to set the world on fire.So we're left with Seagate shares trading sideways year to date, and that's after a strong bounce in October. Investors are skeptical of this company's long-term business prospects, and for good reason. I'm more than happy to stay on the sidelines for this ticker."
"Why Seagate Technology, Interpublic Group, and Community Health Systems Slumped Today","Jul 25, 2017 at 4:30PM","Wall Street was in a celebratory mood on Tuesday, with gains throughout many key financial markets. Climbing stock prices came in part as a result of a rebound in commodities like oil and base metals, and an overall positive trend among companies reporting earnings today supported investors' generally upbeat view of the economy. Yet even though the mood was mostly positive, some companies missed out on the rally and reported bad news that sent their shares lower. Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), Interpublic Group (NYSE:IPG), and Community Health Systems (NYSE:CYH) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.Seagate looks for a new leader after poor resultsShares of Seagate plunged 16.5% after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter financial results and announced a leadership transition. The data storage specialist said that revenue fell more than 9% from the year-ago quarter, dramatically underperforming the smaller drop that most investors had expected, and adjusted earnings came in about a third less than the consensus forecast among those following the stock. Seagate also said that CEO Steve Luczo will leave his role at the end of September, giving way to current COO Dave Mosley and taking on the role of executive chairman of Seagate's board. With the move, Mosley said he hopes to ""lead Seagate into the next era of leadership in the storage technology market,"" but investors didn't seem so upbeat about the company's prospects in light of recent trends.IMAGE SOURCE: SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY.Interpublic blames Washington for its strugglesInterpublic Group stock fell nearly 13.5% in the wake of the company's second-quarter financial report. The advertising company said that revenue was down almost 2% from the year-ago quarter. Net income was down even more sharply, plunging nearly 40% on a reported basis and sending adjusted earnings per share down by nearly a fifth to $0.27 per share. CEO Michael Roth said during the conference call that ""our results in the quarter reflect the fact that macro uncertainty and political gridlock are affecting spend, particularly in the U.S., with clients demonstrating caution in terms of releasing budgets."" Interpublic will try to have greater cost controls to support profits, but investors aren't optimistic that blaming Washington will lead to a turnaround anytime soon.Community Health looks for a cureFinally, shares of Community Health Systems finished down 10%. The hospital operator reacted negatively to earnings news from industry peer HCA Healthcare, which said that lower patient volumes and higher expenses led it to miss its profit expectations in its second-quarter financial report. HCA also reduced its profit guidance for the full 2017 year, and Community Health investors extrapolated that the entire hospital industry would likely see similar fallout. Even with efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with legislation that might be less favorable to Community Health struggling in the Senate, most investors expect healthcare reform to come at some point, and the prospects could be less favorable for hospital operators than the current legislation.10 stocks we like better than Community Health SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks to Buy With Dividends Yielding More Than 4%,"Jun 11, 2017 at 10:04AM","Thousands of stocks pay dividends. For many, however, the yield isn't high enough to get investors excited. That's not the case for AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), ONEOK Partners, L.P. (NYSE:OKS), and Seagate Technology plc (NASDAQ:STX).All three of these stocks claim mouth-watering dividend yields of greater than 4%. Investors have more to like about each of these stocks as well. Here's why AT&T, ONEOK Partners, and Seagate are three dividend stocks you can buy now and receive dividend payments for years to come.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.AT&TLet's first look at AT&T's impressive dividend. Its yield currently stands at 5.05%. The telecommunications giant boasts a strong track record in paying out dividends, with dividend increases for 32 consecutive years. That's enough to land AT&T a spot in the elite group of stocks known as Dividend Aristocrats.Can AT&T keep its streak of dividend hikes going? Probably so. The company currently uses 95% of earnings to fund its dividend program. That's higher than you'd like to see with a dividend stock, but AT&T's strong cash flow should enable it to keep those dividend checks flowing. The company's earnings should also grow in the years to come. AT&T is in the process of acquiring Time Warner. This deal is expected to boost earnings and cash flow for the company. More importantly, it will position AT&T as an even bigger leader as the boundaries between the telecommunications and media industries become increasingly blurred.ONEOK PartnersONEOK Partners might not make the Dividend Aristocrats list like AT&T does, but the master limited partnership's dividend yield of 6.52% is sure to capture the attention of investors. ONEOK Partners, which specializes in processing, storing, and transporting natural gas, has paid a dividend every year since 1994.At first glance, the MLP's dividend might seem to be on somewhat shaky ground. ONEOK Partners' payout ratio stands at 137%, which means the company is spending a good bit more on paying dividends than it's making in profit. There's also the planned merger between ONEOK Partners and its general partner, ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE), which already owns more than 41% of the MLP. A shareholder vote is scheduled for June 30. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.What will happen with the dividend? ONEOK, Inc. is in good shape after a solid first quarter and should be in even better position if the merger goes through as planned. Its dividend currently yields 4.99%. Assuming the merger with ONEOK Partners closes as expected, the company intends to increase its dividend payout by 21% for 2017. The deal should also enable dividend hikes of 9% to 11% annually through 2021.    Seagate TechnologySeagate Technology claims a nice dividend yield of 5.99%. The hard-drive maker has increased its dividend annually in each of the last six years.The company's payout ratio of nearly 104% could make investors a little nervous. However, Seagate's cash flow should be more than enough to keep the dividends coming. Also, that payout ratio is only a snapshot and doesn't reflect Seagate's earnings growth prospects.Despite missing earnings expectations in the most recent quarter, Seagate's earnings prospects appear to be pretty good over the long run. Wall Street analysts project that Seagate will grow earnings by nearly 18% annually over the next five years. My colleague Rich Smith sees Seagate Technology as a dividend stock that's ""perfect for retirement."" With a great yield and solid prospects, I'd agree with Rich's assessment.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

5 Stocks to Buy With Dividends Yielding More Than 5%,"Aug 22, 2017 at 8:04AM","Imagine having a portfolio of stocks that consistently paid dividend yields of more than 5%. That kind of return trounces what most bonds are paying now. And a 5% or greater yield represents over half of the average long-term total return of the S&P 500.The good news is that you don't have to use your imagination. There are quite a few stocks that you can buy right now with dividends yielding more than 5%. Here's why Health Care Property Investors (NYSE:HCP), AT&T (NYSE:T), W. P. Carey (NYSE:WPC), Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), and Omega Healthcare Investors (NYSE:OHI) especially stand out.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Health Care Property InvestorsAs you might guess from its name, Health Care Property Investors (HCP) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on healthcare. The company focuses primarily on senior housing, but also owns medical offices and life-sciences buildings. HCP's dividend currently yields 5.13%. Although the company uses over 130% of its earnings right now to fund its dividend, HCP's solid cash flow should allow it to keep the dividends flowing at least at current levels.Future growth appears likely for HCP for a couple of reasons. First, the aging of baby boomers should create higher demand for senior housing. Second, HCP is well positioned to acquire additional properties.AT&TAT&T is a pioneer in the telecommunications industry and continues to rank among the largest telecom companies in the world. The company makes money primarily from providing wireless and internet solutions to businesses and individual consumers, as well as providing video entertainment through its DIRECTV satellite television services.Many investors are understandably attracted to A&T's dividend, which currently yields 5.24%. The company also claims an impressive track record of 33 consecutive years of dividend increases. Despite a relatively high payout ratio above 90%, AT&T should be able to keep its streak alive due to its strong cash flow.  Although the telecom industry is highly competitive, AT&T's initiative to build out a 5G network should allow the company to retain a leadership position. In addition, the company hopes to finalize its pending acquisition of Time Warner, a move that will open up new possibilities for growth in providing video content to subscribers.W. P. CareyLike HCP, W. P. Carey is a REIT. However, W. P. Carey's focus is on industrial, office, retail, and warehouse properties. The company owns 900 properties, with roughly two-thirds of them in the U.S.  W. P. Carey's dividend currently yields 5.96%. But should investors be concerned about the company's payout ratio of 144%? I don't think so. W. P. Carey's cash flow is solid. It's also dependable, with most of its tenants signing long-term leases -- and none of those tenants represents more than 5% of W. P. Carey's total revenue.There are at least a couple of paths for W. P. Carey to grow revenue and earnings in the future. Further acquisitions are likely for the company. Also, most of the company's leases have contractual rent increases that will generate more money for the company over the duration of the leases.Seagate TechnologySeagate Technology stands out as one of the largest hard-drive manufacturers in the world. The company also makes other data-storage products, including solid state drives and their related controllers, solid state hybrid drives, and storage subsystems.With a dividend yield of 8.03%, Seagate claims one of the most appealing dividends among tech stocks -- and among stocks of any industry, for that matter. Like some of the others on our list, though, Seagate's payout ratio of nearly 98% is high. However, also like those other companies, Seagate claims a solid cash flow. The company has also increased its dividend for six years in a row -- underscoring Seagate's commitment to its dividend program.Seagate's stock has fallen recently, largely as a result of the company's disappointing fourth-quarter results. However, long-term demand for data storage should grow, presenting significant opportunities for Seagate and others in the industry.Omega Healthcare InvestorsOur list started with a healthcare REIT -- and it's ending with one. Omega Healthcare Investors focuses on long-term care (LTC) nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and rehabilitation hospitals. The company owns 999 properties in the U.S. and the U.K.Omega Healthcare Investors boasts an attractive dividend yield of 8.27%. The company has raised its dividends for seven consecutive years, but more impressively for 20 quarters in a row. And Omega Healthcare Investors generates plenty of funds from operations (FFO) to keep the dividends coming.As is the case with HCP, Omega Healthcare Investors stands to reap the benefits of the aging of the baby boomer generation. Look for the company to keep adding to its list of properties in coming years to take advantage of higher demand, particularly in the assisted living facility market. 10 stocks we like better than Omega Healthcare InvestorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks to Buy With Dividends Yielding More Than 6%,"Oct 2, 2017 at 7:47PM","High-yield dividend stocks are always tempting, but you have to be more careful with them than with the average stock. Many high-yield giants turn out to be dividend traps that eventually led to a reduction or elimination of their payouts. It's rare to find a stock yielding 6% right now, and just about all of them have risk factors you need to consider. Nevertheless, if you can take on some risk, you'll find a few stocks worth a closer look. Among them are Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A) (NYSE:RDS-B), Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX).StockDividend YieldRoyal Dutch Shell6.2%Blackstone Group6.9%*Seagate Technology7.5%DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE. * VARIABLE DIVIDEND; YIELD IS BASED ON LAST 12 MONTHS' DISTRIBUTIONS.This stock is keeping up its energyRoyal Dutch Shell has seen many of the same challenges that peers throughout the oil and gas industry have faced in recent years. Plunging prices for crude oil have posed threats for even major players in energy. Like many of its peers, Shell has had to be aggressive in cutting its debt by selling down assets, and some dividend investors have worried about the company's ability to keep paying down its obligations while still making such large cash distributions.In response, Shell is moving even more strongly toward embracing a longer-term approach with its assets and capital investment strategy. Having successfully integrated British multinational energy company BG Group into its corporate structure, Shell is looking at often overlooked parts of its business that are delivering superior returns on capital, such as the downstream and chemicals divisions. The energy giant won't stop looking for ways to boost its overall production, but investors can expect Shell not to make new discoveries or asset acquisitions the sole source of growth supporting the dividend in the years to come. That's good news for shareholders looking for dividends to continue well into the future.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Blackstone profits from smart investmentsThe private equity industry has benefited greatly from the recovery since the 2008 recession, and as the largest alternative asset manager in the world, Blackstone has captured at least its fair share of gains from the bull market. The company counts private equity, hedge funds, real estate, and credit-oriented funds among its core offerings to investors, and in return for its management, Blackstone receives an annual management fee along with a share of any profits that the funds generate. The company makes variable dividend payments based on its success during the period, and that requires dividend investors to accept the unpredictable nature of payouts. For instance, in 2016, distributions were almost 45% less than they had been in 2015 due to a lower-than-usual number of initial public offerings.When times are good, Blackstone has plenty of growth potential. For instance, the sale of logistics and real estate venture Logicor to a Chinese investment firm for nearly $14 billion created a huge payday not just for Blackstone fund investors but also for the company itself because of its stake in the deal. Similar opportunities exist in many industries, and if Blackstone can continue to identify good investments early on, it will be able to deliver rising distributions in the years ahead.Seagate looks to store more profitsThe data storage industry has been a big driver of success over the long run, but evolution in the technology behind storing data has required Seagate and its peers to pivot adeptly. Old-style hard-disk drives still have their role to play in data centers and other applications, but solid-state memory drives and other high-end options have become increasingly important. Seagate's share price has been volatile lately, reflecting questions about the sustainability of the business and the company's ability to keep up with the pace of change.Investors have been nervous about Seagate's dividend for a long time, especially when the company faces major financial shortfalls. For instance, in its most recent quarter, Seagate's revenue came in more than 6% below what investors had wanted to see, and adjusted earnings missed expectations by about a third. Many were also nervous about Steve Luczo's decision to give up the CEO role, but bullish investors see the promotion of new CEO Dave Mosley as a potential catalyst to get the company moving forward again.Seagate, Blackstone, and Shell are far from risk-free, and dividend investors need to understand that any stock with a 6% yield isn't a sure thing. Nevertheless, these three stocks are worth a closer look for those willing to take on some risk, and they'll do their best to sustain their dividends well into the future.10 stocks we like better than Royal Dutch Shell (A Shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Dividend Stocks That Pay You More Than IBM Does,"Dec 20, 2017 at 6:00PM","IBM (NYSE:IBM) was once the most valuable company in the world -- back in the 1980s, when the tech titan dominated the market for mainframe and personal computers. Today, it's been eclipsed by younger tech giants like Apple and Alphabet, but IBM is still a formidable player in information technology. While the stock has struggled in recent years as IBM's transition to a software and services company has taken longer than expected, the company has gained a reputation with investors as a solid dividend payer. It has raised its quarterly payout 17 years in a row, and now offers a strong yield of 3.9%.Still, you can find better yields elsewhere if you know where to look. Below, three of our contributors explain why Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), and Cedar Fair (NYSE:FUN) are better dividend stocks than IBM.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Open up the dividend flood...gateRich Smith (Seagate Technology): I make no apologies for being a fan of IBM's Watson computer technology, and I have to say that as a stock, IBM is also pretty hard to beat. Big Blue remains one of the leading computer technology companies of our time, yet sells for only 12.7 times trailing earnings, and pays a generous dividend yield of 3.9%. It's not easy to find stocks of similar quality, with significantly better numbers -- but I have found one: Seagate Technology.Priced at 15.8 times trailing earnings, Seagate at first glance looks pricier than IBM, but only until you take a look at their relative growth rates. Analysts polled by Yahoo! Finance generally agree that IBM's best growth days are behind it, and it will struggle to grow earnings much faster than 2% over the next five years. In contrast, consensus forecasts call for Seagate to grow earnings at better than 18%, which is fast enough to give the hard-drive specialist a PEG ratio of less than 0.9, versus IBM's PEG ratio of roughly 5.5. (Note: When it comes to PEG ratios, smaller is cheaper -- and better).Granted, last quarter Seagate only grew its earnings 8% year over year, so it may take some time for that 18% growth to materialize. Meanwhile, though, Seagate's dividend yield of 6% is 50% more generous than IBM's. At that rate, I think investors can afford to wait.A high-yield pharma playGeorge Budwell (AstraZeneca): With a forward yield of around 4.4%, the British pharma AstraZeneca sports a richer yield than even International Business Machines Corporation. However, the sustainability of the pharma giant's generous dividend program has lately come under serious scrutiny, for a variety of reasons.The biggest issue is that CEO Pascal Soriot's projection of double-digit top-line growth doesn't appear to be realistic, due to a handful of key setbacks in immuno-oncology. Last July, for instance, Astra's flagship immuno-oncology drug, Imfinzi, failed to meet its primary endpoint as part of a combo therapy in advanced small-cell lung cancer, potentially wiping billions in sales off the table.On the flip side of the coin, Astra has still been able to build a respectable stable of new oncology products -- even though its putative star product in this field has yet to live up to expectations. In the recent past, for example, Astra has gained regulatory approvals for Calquence (a blood-cancer medicine), Tagrisso (an inhibitor for cancers with mutated epidermal growth factor receptors), and Lynparza (for advanced ovarian cancer). Imfinzi can also potentially redeem itself in lung cancer next year, if it can extend the survivorship curve in its ongoing trial. So there's no reason to panic just yet.Down the road, AstraZeneca's eye-popping dividend may have to be pared back, but the final word on its top-notch shareholder rewards program also has yet to be written. The next twelve months will be crucial in determining the fate of Astra's progressive dividend policy. But the company does seem intent on doing everything it can to stave off a reduction, as a service to its loyal shareholders.The right kind of roller coasterJeremy Bowman (Cedar Fair): High-yielding tech stocks aren't easy to find, so investors may want to look further afield than IBM and its peers. One under-the-radar dividend payer I like is Cedar Fair, owner and operator of theme parks including its namesake Cedar Point in Ohio, and more than a dozen others, such as Kings Dominion in Virginia, Great America in California, and Dorney Park in Pennsylvania.The stock, which offers a dividend yield of 5.1% today, has delivered solid returns for investors. Shares have more than doubled over the last five years; the dividend payout has moved steadily higher as well, doubling in that time, though increases have slowed more recently.Cedar Fair's business remains solid; the company posted record revenue of $653 million in the key third quarter, as the summer months are by far the company's busiest time of the year. Earnings per share increased 9% in the period to $3.38, bettering estimates of $3.21.The company also maintained its long-term outlook: to grow adjusted EBITDA at 4% a year, and increase dividends at the same clip. Cedar Fair has a payout ratio of around 100% based on its cash flow, which could present problems if earnings start to fall. But as long as the economy remains strong, Cedar Fair should be able to put up steady growth. Meanwhile, the 5.1% yield should keep investors happy, even if the stock's share appreciation moderates.10 stocks we like better than AstraZenecaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

These 3 Stocks Are Undeniably Cheap,"Nov 8, 2017 at 8:09AM","Some stocks might not appear to be cheap at first glance, but once you understand their particular dynamics, they're attractively valued. Other stocks, though, are cheap no matter how you look at them.Oaktree Capital Group (NYSE: OAK), Seagate Technology plc (NASDAQ:STX), and Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) definitely belong to the latter group. These three stocks are undeniably cheap. But are they smart picks for investors over the long run?IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Oaktree Capital GroupOaktree Capital Group stock trades at less than 11 times expected earnings. That's a low valuation by itself, but the asset manager looks even more attractive factoring in the distributions that it pays and its growth prospects.Let's first look at Oaktree's distributions. Its yield currently stands at 6.82% -- definitely a plus for income-seeking investors. However, how much Oaktree pays out varies considerably from quarter to quarter. In the third quarter, for example, the company reduced its distribution payout by more than 50% compared to what it paid in the second quarter. Still, Oaktree's return of cash to investors is a big plus.As for growth prospects, Wall Street analysts project the company will be able to grow earnings by nearly 13% annually over the next five years. While that estimate could be overly optimistic, Oaktree is confident about its ability to grow its business through multiple channels, including investing in distressed debt and emerging markets. Seagate TechnologySeagate Technology's year hasn't been so great, with the stock falling more than 15% by early August. However, the hard-drive maker's share price has rebounded significantly, thanks to better-than-expected results in its fiscal 2018 first-quarter report just a couple of weeks ago. But Seagate stock still looks cheap even with the bounce, with shares trading at less than nine times expected earnings.Like Oaktree, Seagate's cheap stock price is accompanied by an attractive dividend and good growth prospects. The dividend currently yields 6.94%. Although Seagate is using most of its earnings to fund the dividend right now, the company's cash flow appears to be sufficient to keep the dividends flowing.Analysts expect Seagate to increase earnings by 18% annually over the next five years. Even with significant competition, Seagate thinks it will benefit from higher demand for storage thanks to the tremendous growth in data generated by organizations across the world.Steel DynamicsSteel Dynamics stock trades at less than 13 times expected earnings. Even better, the steelmaker's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio stands at 0.69. Stocks with PEG ratios of less than 1 are typically considered to be reasonable bargains.As you might expect, Steel Dynamics' fortunes hinge primarily on steel prices. The bad news for the company is that steel prices in the U.S. have been relatively low, in large part due to high levels of steel imports. The good news, though, is that Steel Dynamics remains one of the strongest steelmakers in the country, with Credit Suisse calling it the ""most capital efficient U.S. steel company.""Steel Dynamics' dividend is solid as well, although its yield of 1.65% pales in comparison to that of Oaktree and Seagate. However, the steelmaker currently uses only 27% of earnings to fund its dividend, which bodes well for the company's ability to raise its dividend in the future.Bargain buys?My view is that all three of these cheap stocks are good picks over the long run. Keep in mind, though, that Oaktree Capital and Steel Dynamics are especially dependent on the broader economy.Oaktree CEO Jay Wintrob acknowledged this fact in his third-quarter comments, saying, ""At this point in the cycle, we continue to deploy capital across our strategies in a cautious and disciplined manner, and we continue to capitalize on the current market environment by actively harvesting investments."" However, that ""harvesting"" of investments could help Oaktree when great investment opportunities arise. For Steel Dynamics, sustained demand in the construction sector, particularly in the non-residential portion of the market, is key. If this demand persists and steel prices rise, Steel Dynamics appears to be well-positioned for nice gains. Seagate Technology also is susceptible to overall economic conditions. However, I agree with the company's view that demand for data storage will grow tremendously in the future and provide a nice tailwind for the stock.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

10 Highest-Yielding Dividend Stocks Today: To Buy or Not to Buy,"Jul 19, 2017 at 6:07PM","Interest rates have been hovering near historic lows for several years now. That's a big problem for retirees, many of whom depend on income from their investments to help finance their lifestyles, and who may prefer interest-paying assets like bonds due to their low risk.But poor returns from those ""safe"" assets have incentivized some income investors to put money in the highest-yielding stocks they can find in order to generate decent level of regular returns. This might sound like an attractive plan, but it can actually be a risky strategy. Too many stocks wind up with impressive-looking yields because their shares have been punished, often justifiably, by the market. The business itself may not be able to sustain such a payout much longer, and falling stocks may have further to fall.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Recognizing all this, let's put the 10 highest-yielding stocks from the S&P 500 to the test to figure out if any of them could be worth buying today.  CompanyTickerDividend YieldFrontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR)16.3%CenturyLink(NYSE:CTL)9.4%Mattel(NASDAQ:MAT)7%Macy's(NYSE:M) 6.8% Seagate Technology(NASDAQ:STX) 6.4% Kohl's(NYSE:KSS)5.7%AT&T(NYSE:T)5.4%Verizon Communication(NYSE:VZ)5.3%L. Brands(NYSE:LB)5.3%Ford(NYSE:F)5.1%DATA SOURCE: FINVIZ, AS OF JULY 17, 2017. THIS LIST EXCLUDES REITS.Test No. 1: The payout ratioSmart income investors know that the first metric that they should look at when considering any high-yield dividend stock is its payout ratio. This figure is calculated by dividing the company's last 12 months of net income by its total dividend payout. The end result will tell investors what fraction of a company's profits are being used to cover the dividend. While this statistic is far from a perfect gauge -- one-time charges can sometimes heavily bias earnings downward -- it does provide investors with a quick way to measure a dividend's sustainability.Here's how these 10 companies stack up:CompanyPayout RatioFrontier Communications NMCenturyLink212%Mattel190%Macy's82%Seagate Technology104%Kohl's60%AT&T95%Verizon Communications77%L. Brands63%Ford64%TABLE SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE. NM = NOT MEANINGFUL; THESE COMPANIES REPORTED LOSSES OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS.A quick glance at the table above shows just how useful the payout ratio can be at helping you cull your list of potential investments. Frontier Communication hasn't even reported a profit over the last twelve months, which is why it doesn't have a payout ratio. After factoring in that it recently slashed its dividend by 62%, I'm content to eliminate the company from contention.Investors should be equally wary of investing in CenturyLink, Mattel, or Seagate Technology. All three of these companies are paying out more in dividends than they are earning in net income, which isn't a sustainable practice over the long term. That makes me believe they should also be excluded from further consideration.Test No. 2: Growth potentialIf a company's payout ratio looks sustainable, then I next like to get a sense of its growth potential. In my judgement, a dividend stock is only attractive if it can increase its payout over time. No company can do that long term without a growing profit stream.One quick way to gauge a company's growth potential is to look at both its historic rate of growth and its forecast growth rate over the next five years. While this method isn't foolproof, it does give us a sense of a where a company has been and where it could be going.Here's how our remaining six companies stack up in this area:CompanyActual Earnings Growth Over Past 5 Years (Annualized)Estimated Earnings Growth Over Next 5 Years (Annualized)Macy's (5.1%)18.6%Kohl's(4.1%)5.3%AT&T4.3%7%Verizon Communications12.4%2.5%L. Brands8.9% 7.9%Ford2.7% -11.95%DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE.As you can see, big box retailers Macy's and Kohl's have seen their profits head in the wrong direction over the last five years. While there are a number of factors in play here -- declining mall traffic, discounting by competing bankrupt retailers, the rise of e-commerce -- the overall result has been shrinking net income. That's troubling, but it is interesting to see that Wall Street believes that both retailers will post healthy profit gains over the next five years -- Macy's in particular. That bullishness likely stems in part from the company's willingness to close underperforming stores and monetize its real estate assets. If that forecast growth rate can be believed, Macy's could certainly be worth considering. AT&T and Verizon Communications have both produced consistent growth over time, which makes sense given their dominance of the U.S. wireless industry. It is noteworthy that Verizon's profits have grown at a double-digit rate while Ma Bell's gains have been more muted. However, analysts expect that AT&T will be the faster grower from here, a view that likely stems from its recent purchase of DirecTV and its pending merger with Time Warner. If that merger gets the green light, then the company should have ample opportunity to grow revenue and cut costs, both of which could lead to an expanding bottom line. L. Brands, the retail company behind Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, has managed to keep its profits moving in the right direction in spite of facing the same issues that have plagued its big-box competition. Beyond its brand strength, one explanation for its success could be the company's big push into e-commerce. Last year, the company sold nearly $2 billion worth of products through its direct channels, representing about 16% of total sales. The company's growth plans call for a continued emphasis on online sales, and an intense push to grow its store count in China. If those moves pay off, then shareholders could certainly benefit.Meanwhile, analysts are predicting that Ford's profit trend will shift into reverse over the coming years. That view likely stems from worries that North American auto sales have peaked, plus concerns about it recent sudden change in leadership, and the long-term threats posed by electric and autonomous vehicles. New CEO Jim Hackett will have his work cut out for him in terms of changing Wall Street's outlook on Ford's. These two high-yield stocks could be worth owningWhile these stocks are far from risk-free, and each has its own unique set of pluses and minuses, I must admit that Macy's and L. Brands are the two that interest me most from this list. Both companies can afford to make their dividend payments today, and could be in position to grow after the current wave of retail bankruptcies and store closures finally subsides. That's an intriguing combination that makes them worthy of further investigation."
3 Hated Dividend Stocks to Buy Now,"Oct 11, 2017 at 6:33AM","Sometimes, the most hated stocks are the ones worth looking at the closest. That's especially true for stocks that pay dividends, since their yields rise as their share prices fall. If the reasons behind investors' displeasure with the stocks either are no longer valid or might soon change, these stocks could be great deals.Three stocks particularly fall into this category, in my view: Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), Energy Transfer Partners (NYSE:ETP), and Omega Healthcare Investors (NYSE:OHI). Here's why these are three hated dividend stocks you can buy now.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Energy Transfer PartnersEnergy Transfer Partners stock has plunged more than 20% in 2017 and around 60% over the last three years. Investors have soured on the midstream master limited partnership (MLP) for several reasons. The downturn in the oil market hurt the company's business, but Energy Transfer Partners also has encountered delays in some of its most important projects.These woes led the company to slash its dividend earlier this year. Even with that cut, though, Energy Transfer Partners still boasts a sky-high yield of 11.9%. Further dividend cuts don't appear to be on the horizon. However, the yield would still be very attractive even if more trimming was needed.Is there a reason to buy Energy Transfer Partners stock now? Yes. The company looks like it might have turned the corner. In the second quarter, Energy Transfer Partners reported that adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased 16.7% year over year. Distributable cash flow jumped 21.5% from the prior-year period.In addition, there are a couple of things that fellow Fool Matt DiLallo pointed out recently that could be huge catalysts for the stock. First, Energy Transfer Partners has a sizable position in its sibling company, Sunoco LP, and Sunoco could look to buy back some equity. That could allow Energy Transfer Partners to raise up to $1 billion. Second, the company could take steps to reduce its incentive distribution rights (IDR) burden, which give the MLP's general partner, Sunoco Partners LLC, an increasing share in the incremental distributable cash flow the partnership generates. Reducing this IDR burden would likely send Energy Transfer Partners' units higher.Seagate TechnologySeagate Technology's share price has dropped nearly 10% this year. It's apparent that many expect it to continue to suffer: More than 17% of the stock's float is currently sold short. The hard-disk drive maker posted disappointing fiscal fourth-quarter results in July. One area where Seagate won't disappoint investors, though, is with its dividend. Seagate's yield currently stands north of 7.5%. And while the company is using nearly all of its earnings to fund dividends, Seagate's cash flow is solid and should be sufficient to keep the dividends flowing at current levels.The primary reason to buy Seagate Technology stock is its long-term prospects. Several of the factors behind the company's revenue and earnings misses in the fiscal fourth quarter were due to temporary issues. For example, there were some supply chain problems affecting revenue that should be worked out in the near future.Over the long run, the most important technologies, including artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, will drive increased demand for data storage. Seagate remains one of the top players in the data storage market. That isn't likely to change anytime soon. Buying the stock now locks in a terrific yield for a business that should rebound.Omega Healthcare InvestorsOmega Healthcare Investors stock hasn't been beaten down this year, although its share price hasn't gone up much, either. So why categorize Omega Healthcare as a hated dividend stock? More than 22% of the float is currently sold short, indicating that there are plenty of investors who are pretty bearish about this healthcare-focused real estate investment trust (REIT).Probably the biggest reason for investors' skepticism is that the company reported an earnings decline of nearly 40% in its last quarter. Much of that decrease stemmed from higher interest expense and refinancing costs.The good news for investors is that Omega Healthcare pays an attractive dividend, which currently yields 8.1%. It also has a solid history of growth: The company has increased its dividend for 20 consecutive quarters.Omega Healthcare investors should benefit from an unstoppable trend: the aging of the baby boomer generation. The company owns skilled nursing and assisted living properties throughout the U.S. and U.K. Omega Healthcare stock might be hated now, but it's one that investors should come to love over time with its increasing dividends and solid long-term growth prospects.10 stocks we like better than Omega Healthcare InvestorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Top Tech Dividend Stocks to Buy Now,"Dec 29, 2017 at 10:41AM","The tech sector didn't used to be a great place to look if you were on the hunt for high yield. That's changed as some companies have matured and shifted into periods of slower growth, and investors now have a range of tech dividend stocks to choose from.In addition to offering investors dependable returned income, some of these companies also have underappreciated business prospects and beaten-down valuations -- setting up dynamics that could pave the way for substantial capital appreciation on top of regular income generation. Here's why IBM (NYSE:IBM), AT&T (NYSE:T), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) are top income-generating stocks in the tech sector. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.IBMWith a 3.9% yield and a 22-year history of annual payout increases, IBM has one of the best returned-income profiles in the tech sector. The stock also looks pretty cheap trading at roughly 11 times forward earnings estimates and 13 times trailing free cash flow. Those are attractive characteristics, to be sure, but they don't exist in a vacuum.With a 22-quarter streak of consecutive year-over-year sales declines and trailing revenues at a 15-year low, there are valid reasons why the market has been cool on Big Blue. Shares have lost roughly 8% of their value in 2017 while the S&P 500 index has gained nearly 20%. Even so, the stock looks like a good play for investors who are willing to take on the risk profile that comes with its shift to new businesses.There are some compelling indicators that its turnaround effort has the company poised for a rebound. Last quarter saw its combined cloud, security, data analytics, and mobile businesses grow revenues 11% and comprise 45% of total sales. Meanwhile, its legacy hardware and software services businesses declined roughly 8%. The company's cloud services have tallied up $15.8 billion in sales over the trailing-12-month period, and a favorable growth outlook for the overall cloud infrastructure and platform markets gives IBM a promising avenue to return to sales growth over the long term. It's also staked investments in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and quantum computing -- opportunities that are difficult to model at present but ones that could have tremendous payoffs. IBM's business outlook isn't as concrete as other top dividend stocks you might find in other sectors, but it offers investors a rare combination of value, growth potential, and a great yield.AT&T2017 was supposed to be the year that AT&T put most of the finishing touches on its merger with Time Warner. It didn't play out that way, and shares have shed roughly 9% of their value this year amid that disappointment and declining subscriptions for the company's postpaid wireless service and core DirecTV satellite television packages. While the telecom giant's stock has significantly underperformed the broader market this year, soggy performance presents long-term investors with an opportunity to buy a good company at an inexpensive price.Shares trade at just 13 times forward earnings estimates and come with a dividend that helps make a strong case for ownership. AT&T packs a roughly 5% yield and recently announced its 34th consecutive annual payout increase -- raising its payout roughly 2%. Admittedly, payout growth has been slow in recent years, but it already offers a great yield and shareholders can count on regular increases going forward. The company's business prospects appear to be underappreciated as well.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.AT&T is on track to be a leader in 5G network technology. While previous generations of wireless networks have delivered faster connections for mobile devices, 5G will also serve as the key fabric for connecting a new range of devices including cars, wearables, and smart-city technologies. Expanding its 5G network technology will be capital intensive, but it should also widen the company's competitive edge in the wireless space and help it branch into new, high-growth platform and service categories. If the company's acquisition of Time Warner gets the go-ahead following a pending legal challenge from the Department of Justice, AT&T will also become a global leader in entertainment content and have new service bundling and advertising opportunities that could spur sustained earnings momentum. I think there's a good chance that the merger will eventually go through -- paving the way for a new growth phase for AT&T -- but the stock has the potential to be a worthwhile long-term investment even if the deal were to be blocked.Seagate TechnologyWhile Seagate Technology is still the world's leading producer of hard drives, shifts in the industry have hamstrung performance in recent years and depressed the company's share price. Cloud storage is presenting alternative ways to house data for computers and mobile devices, and the company's chief rival Western Digital has been the biggest beneficiary of rising demand for solid state drives. Under these pressures, Seagate's stock has shed nearly 40% of its value over the last three yearsThe consumer market might not drive growth in the same ways going forward, but Seagate is looking at increased infrastructure spending from cloud service providers and large enterprises that seems likely to power performance over the long term. The world is still in the midst of a digital data explosion, with new devices and the proliferation of high-definition video streams ensuring that there's more information to be stored and transmitted with each passing minute. Putting this growth trend in context, research firm IDC estimates that the amount of data generated annually will have increased tenfold from 2016 to 2025 as connected devices, automation, and machine-to-machine communications become increasingly central in every day life. That's going to create a lot of new demand at the data-center level, and Seagate is in position to benefit.The company's shares have rallied since its first-quarter report delivered better-than-expected results in October, but the stock still looks to present a bargain for long-term investors. Seagate trades at roughly 11 times trailing free cash flow and 11 times forward earnings estimates while offering a 6.1% yield. If it even comes close to hitting the average analyst estimate for annual earnings growth of nearly 19% over the next five years, the stock will prove to be an absolute steal at today's prices.10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks That Are Absurdly Cheap Right Now,"Dec 15, 2017 at 6:22AM","With the stock market at record levels, finding cheap stocks has taken on new layers of difficulty. It has also become increasingly important.To help our readers identify investments that offer protection against a potential downturn, as well as avenues to substantial capital appreciation, we put together a panel of Motley Fool investors and asked each member propose a stock they think presents long-term opportunity at a relative bargain price today, and to shed some light on why. Their picks: IBM (NYSE:IBM), General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX).IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.A cheap dividend play for intrepid investorsChris Neiger (IBM): I have to get this out of the way first: IBM is not for everyone. The company's top line has fallen for 22 consecutive quarters and in the third quarter of 2017, its earnings fell 4% year over year. It's no wonder then, that IBM shares are trading at just 13 times the company's trailing 12-month earnings, and 11 times estimated forward earnings -- both ratios far below the tech industry's average. IBM is in the middle of a major transition right now as it pivots toward a focus on new growth areas like cloud computing and artificial intelligence. For example, the cloud now accounts for 20% of the company's top line; over the past 12 months, IBM has brought in $15.8 billion from its cloud sales. The company says that just over half of that cloud revenue come from ""as-a-service"" sales, which means those deals will be bringing in recurring revenue, in contrast to one-off hardware or software sales.The tech giant is also looking to its Watson artificial intelligence (AI) and other cognitive computing services for growth. IBM's cognitive computing sales hit $4.4 billion in Q3 -- 23% of total sales. The company believes it can keep growing this segment; it expects the entire cognitive computing market to be worth $2 trillion by 2025. IBM is clearly making some strides on the cloud and cognitive computing fronts, but this beaten-up company still has a long way to go before it convinces most investors that its stock is a safe bet. One thing that may tempt some investors to jump in on this turnaround play is IBM's 3.9% dividend. I'm content to wait on the sidelines for now, but the company is certainly one that investors should keep an eye on.Overlooked opportunityDaniel Miller (General Motors): Even after General Motors'  stock's 21% rise over the past six months, it still trades at a paltry 6.9 forward price-to-earnings ratio, per Morningstar.com earnings estimates -- and that's absurdly cheap territory.Too many investors are focused on the short term: That forward P/E  reflects peaking auto sales in the U.S. market, GM's profit engine. But investors should look at the opportunity ahead in an industry destined to  evolve into something completely new over the next two to three decades. GM's driving toward a vision of zero crashes, zero congestion and zero emissions. It's opportunities include new revenue streams from the connected car (where its OnStar service gives it an entry point); shared mobility projects that include its Maven brand; and the development of driverless vehicle technology and electric vehicles.While those opportunities will take time to develop and bear fruit, GM has also proven it can improve its business here and now, and reward its shareholders. In fact, from 2012 through 2017, the automaker has returned $25 billion through dividends and repurchases. That's reduced shares outstanding by 25%, and generated a payout that currently yields 3.6%.The auto industry is on track to change more in the next two decades than it did over the previous ten, and GM is more prepared for that type of evolution than ever before. That should be music to the ears of investors willing to ride the cyclical auto industry and focus on the long term.Store this one away for the long termKeith Noonan (Seagate Technology): Even after rallying 20% since its releasing its first-quarter results on Oct. 23, Seagate Technology's stock still looks like a bargain. It trades at roughly 11 times trailing free cash flow, 10.5 times forward earnings estimates, and just just 1.2 times forward sales. While there are good reasons that the hard disk drive maker trades at low multiples relative to the broader market, there's enough upside to justify owning the company for the long haul. Let's talk first about why the stock can be had for cheap. Seagate's sales have dipped roughly 25% over the last three years as solid-state drives (a product category led by competitor Western Digital) have gained traction and increasing adoption for cloud storage, casting uncertainty over the fate of the hard disk drive business. While the rise of cloud storage means less consumer demand for hard disk drives, the data boom stemming from the rapid increase in the number of connected devices and the size of files transmitted means that data centers will have increased storage needs. In fact, research firm IDC estimates that annual global data generation will grow tenfold from 2016 to 2025 -- a trend that looks very favorable for Seagate shareholders.The stock also offers investors a generous dividend that bolsters the case for long-term ownership. Shares currently yield roughly 6%, and the company's six-year streak of annual payout increases suggests that Seagate will continue to bolster its returned-income profile. With the current dividend consuming just 65% of trailing free cash flow, the company appears to be in good shape to continue boosting its payout.Seagate's big dividend, low earnings multiples, and underappreciated business prospects point to value that's much greater than the market is giving the company credit for. 10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

These 3 Tech Dividend Stocks Are Ridiculously Cheap,"Jul 12, 2017 at 8:48PM","Many investors buy tech stocks for growth. But with the market hovering near all-time highs, it might be smart to own some slower-growth ""mature"" tech stocks which pay dividends and trade at lower valuations. Here are three stocks which fit that bill -- Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), and Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN).QualcommQualcomm, the biggest mobile chipmaker in the world, pays a forward yield of 4.1%. It's raised that dividend every year since it started paying it in 2003. That trend should continue for the foreseeable future, since the compeny only spent 70% of its earnings and 56% of its free cash flow on dividends over the past 12 months.SOURCE: GETTY.Qualcomm is also fundamentally cheap at 19 times earnings, which is lower than the industry average P/E of 24 for semiconductor makers. But analysts expect its revenue and earnings to respectively fall 3% and 4% this year, as its chipmaking unit cedes market share to cheaper rivals and first-party chips from device makers, and its higher-margin licensing business continues to face pressure from regulators, rivals, and customers, which all claim that its licensing practices are anti-competitive.Those challenges seem daunting, but Qualcomm is aggressively expanding into adjacent markets like wearables, drones, cars, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices to offset the challenges to its mobile business. It also plans to acquire NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), which would make it the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world and expand its serviceable addressable markets by about 40% in 2020. If that deal closes, Qualcomm will evolve into a better diversified chipmaker with more sustainable growth.SeagateHard drive maker Seagate pays a forward yield of 6.6%. Seagate hasn't raised that payout since 2015, but it only spent 77% of its earnings and 38% of its free cash flow on those payments over the past 12 months, indicating that it has plenty of room to continue making payments, and maybe even make hikes in the future.Seagate stopped raising its dividend due to cash flow concerns, but its free cash flow growth rebounded over the past year on stronger sales of its enterprise storage products. Unlike its bigger rival Western Digital, Seagate doesn't have a major presence in the higher-growth SSD (solid-state drive) market or flash memory. However, Seagate compensates for that weakness with partnerships with memory makers Micron and SK Hynix.Analysts expect Seagate's revenue to dip 2% this year, but for its earnings -- which are boosted by better cost controls and share buybacks -- to nearly double. This makes Seagate a fairly cheap play at 16 times earnings, which is much lower than the industry average P/E of 70 for data storage providers.GarminGPS maker Garmin pays a forward yield of 4%. It spent 73% of its earnings and 82% of its free cash flow on that dividend over the past 12 months, but it hasn't raised that payout since 2015. However, Garmin remains a cheap stock at 14 times earnings, which is less than half the industry average P/E of 30 for scientific and technical instrument makers.SOURCE: GARMIN.Wall Street expects Garmin's revenue to stay flat this year, and for its earnings to decline 5%. Those declines are attributed to its transition away from its shrinking automotive GPS business (which are being displaced by smartphones and in-dash units) toward higher sales of GPS devices for marine, aviation, and outdoor uses. It also owns a growing wearables business, which made it the fifth largest wearables maker in the world during the first quarter of 2017 according to research firm IDC.Analysts expect that transition to produce better growth next year as revenue and earnings respectively rise 1% and 2%. Those aren't jaw-dropping growth figures, but they should make Garmin a fairly reliable income play for the foreseeable future. The key takeawaysQualcomm, Seagate, and Garmin definitely aren't rocket ship stocks, and they have obvious weaknesses. Qualcomm still needs to weather the regulatory headwinds and close the NXP deal, Seagate must address waning sales of traditional HDDs (hard disk drives), and Garmin must continue growing its higher-growth businesses to offset its automotive declines. Nonetheless, all three companies should interest investors looking for cheap stocks with high yields."
3 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirement,"Jun 5, 2017 at 7:21AM","Dividend stocks can be reliable sources of extra income for retirees, but like any equity, they're never going to be totally free from risk. So it's important to weigh a dividend stock's risk profile against its ability to provide a steady stream of income for long periods of time.Keeping this theme in mind, we turned to our contributors to ask them which dividend stocks they think are perfect vehicles for retirees. They suggested Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), Target (NYSE:TGT), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX). Read on to find out why these three stocks might be stellar income stocks for retirees. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.This big pharma is a great source of passive incomeGeorge Budwell (Bristol-Myers Squibb): Pharma stocks in general tend to be outstanding sources of passive income because of their extraordinary free cash flows and exceptional growth prospects. But Bristol-Myers Squibb is arguably in a class by itself -- even within this elite group -- because of its recent pivot toward immuno-oncology and cardiovascular care.The long and short of it is that Bristol's top line has been growing by double digits lately as the result of its highly successful PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo that's indicated for a variety of cancers, along with the breakout success of its next-generation blood thinner, Eliquis. In the first quarter of 2017, for example, these two drugs saw their sales grow by an astounding 60% and 50%, respectively, relative to 2016.  As a direct result, Bristol's 12-month trailing payout ratio has now fallen to only 53%, which is rock bottom for a pharma stock. So while Bristol's current yield of 2.87% is below average with its peer group, the company can -- and probably will -- up its payout soon. Equally as important, Bristol's dividend appears to be sustainable for the long haul, making it an outstanding source of passive income for retirees.  Hit the target with this stockDan Caplinger (Target): The retail industry has gone through some tough times, and even stalwarts like Target have been struggling to find ways to get through difficult conditions. Target stock is at levels the company hasn't seen in more than five years, and some investors are concerned that the retailer won't be able to withstand the pressures from e-commerce specialists and other competitors. Companies that don't have brick-and-mortar locations enjoy substantial cost savings over the vast amounts that Target has to spend on its store footprints. Meanwhile, even other big-box retailers have striven to build up their online presence, threatening to leave Target behind. Yet Target is working hard to answer those challenges, with programs like Target Restock aimed toward meeting consumer demand for quick turnaround on delivery items.Historically, Target has been able to thread the needle between offering inexpensive goods while maintaining a reputation for trendy products. Along the way, Target has treated its investors well, paying rising dividends each and every year for just shy of half a century. Target stock now yields more than 4%, reflecting the drop in the share price recently. Yet that offers investors a nice payout while they wait for better conditions in the retail industry to take shape. Unless you think that retail as we know it will cease to exist, Target makes a solid choice for retirement investors looking for income.Seagate's a tech stock, a value stock, and a dividend stock all rolled into oneRich Smith (Seagate Technology):You might not ordinarily think a tech stock is a great thing to own in retirement -- but that really depends on the tech stock. Me, I think Seagate Technology looks just about perfect for retirement. Here's why.If you're retired, chances are you aren't going to spend a lot of time worrying about whether your stock is up or down, or trading in and out based on the twists and turns of the market. You'll be too busy traveling, catching up on your reading, and spending time with the grandkids to indulge in day-trading distractions. So long as the dividend checks keep coming -- and so long as they're generously large -- you can afford to not sweat the small stuff and let your money ride on a great company.That's why a ""volatile"" stock like Seagate, which can both soar when computer memory prices are high and swing low when the market is flooded with memory and prices are low, could nonetheless be a perfect stock for a retiree willing to buy it, hold it, and cash the dividend checks as they come in. Right now, for example, with NAND memory supplies tight, and hard drive prices rising, Seagate stock is soaring -- up 80% over the past year. Seagate is profiting from this trend, even as archrival Western Digital is showing negative profits.Granted, priced today at 17.4 times earnings, Seagate doesn't look particularly cheap -- but analysts project that the trends benfiting Seagate will yield 18.9% long-term earnings growth at the company, which does work out to a cheap-sounding 0.9 PEG ratio. More importantly, Seagate boasts exceptionally high earnings quality, with each $1 of ""GAAP"" earnings backed up by more than $2 in cash profits. Free cash flow at the company for the past 12 months ran to $1.5 billion -- twice reported earnings.Topping it all off, Seagate pays an admirably high dividend yield of 5.9%. With $3 billion worth of cash in the bank, $1.5 billion more rolling in the door annually, and strong growth prospects ahead, Seagate is a dividend stock -- and a tech stock -- that's just perfect for retirement. 10 stocks we like better than Bristol-Myers SquibbWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Danger Lurks for These 3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks,"Jun 22, 2017 at 7:12AM","High-yield dividend stocks are the Holy Grail of income investing -- stocks that don't cost a lot yet pay dividends far above the market average, which is currently just 2.1%. But to paraphrase the Grail Knight from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, you must choose your high-yield dividend stocks wisely, for while the true Grail will bring you profits, the false Grail will take them from you.Fat dividends are certainly nice while they last. But if a company isn't earning enough profits to pay for its dividend, eventually, you know that dividend is going away -- or at least getting cut. And this is the danger that stalks shares of Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS), and Waddell & Reed Financial (NYSE:WDR).THERE'S A PREDATOR IN THE BUSH, AND IT COULD BE STALKING YOUR DIVIDEND. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Here are a few numbers that will help you see why.StockYieldDividend Per ShareEarnings Per ShareSeagate Technology6%$2.52$2.43Barnes & Noble8.8%$0.60$0.05Waddell & Reed Financial9.8%$1.84$1.72DATA SOURCE: S&P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE.Out of money, out of the gateLet's begin our review of stocks living beyond their means with Seagate, a computer hard-drive maker and generous dividend payer that's maybe just a bit too generous with its payouts.I've spoken positively of Seagate in the past, with its robust free cash flow, its strong growth prospects, and, of course, its big 6% dividend yield. That said, it may be worth looking at the other side of the coin, and examining the risk that this dividend may not be all it's cracked up to be. Seagate has been riding a rising tide of demand for computer memory, boosted by constrained supply of flash memory in particular. As its fortunes have risen, so has its dividend -- up nearly threefold in size over the past five years, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.But here's the thing: Seagate suffered a big revenue decline last year, down 19% year over year, which did a number on its profits as well -- down 84% from 2015 levels. Although earnings rebounded nicely at the start of the New Year, it still leaves Seagate with less in earnings per share than it's currently promising to pay out in dividends.Granted, if earnings continue to rise this year and next, as analysts expect them to, Seagate should quickly grow itself out of this problem. Situations can change quickly in the tech sphere, however. Dividend investors should be aware of the risk if projected growth doesn't materialize.Selling books? That's still a thing?Amazon's invention of the Kindle, and the spread of e-books to iPads and similar devices, has not been good news for booksellers such as Barnes & Noble. The stock pays an impressive 8.8% dividend yield, but mostly that's because as its dividend has remained constant at $0.60 per year since 2015, its stock price has collapsed -- falling by nearly half over the past year and thus swelling the size of the dividend relative to the stock price.In my experience, this is the kind of situation that usually ends up with management deciding to ""right-size"" its dividend back to where it was before its stock collapsed. And in Barnes & Noble's case, that would imply that a dividend cut of perhaps 50% or more could be coming down the pike.What might be the catalyst that causes management to make such an unpopular decision? Here's a clue: Barnes & Noble has lost money in four of the past five years, and its trailing-12-month earnings currently stand at just $0.05. That's enough profit earned in 12 months to pay for about one month's worth of dividend checks. With cash running low -- less than $12 million cash on hand, versus $18 million in long-term debt -- I'd expect Barnes & Noble management to cut its dividend sooner rather than later.You'd think bankers would be smarter about moneyRounding out our terrible three dividend payers today is Waddell & Reed Financial, an investment banker with a serious dividend problem. Waddell & Reed is halfway into its third year of declining revenue, and profits for the past 12 months are down more than half from what Waddell & Reed was earning as recently as 2014.Yet as revenue has run down and earnings have dried up, Waddell & Reed has continued to raise its dividend, to the point where it's now paying out $1.07 in dividends for every $1 it earns. While it's certainly possible that business will improve, and that Waddell & Reed will one day earn enough to afford its generous dividend payout, that day may not arrive soon. Analysts who follow the stock tell S&P Global that they expect Waddell & Reed's profits to be down again this year -- and next year, and the year after that as well.In fact, based on projections of adjusted earnings, Waddell & Reed won't be earning enough profit to cover its entire $1.84-per-share dividend before 2022 at the earliest, and perhaps not even then.Sooner or later, something's got to give. My guess: It will be the dividend.10 stocks we like better than Barnes & NobleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What Happened in the Stock Market Today,"Oct 23, 2017 at 5:05PM","Stocks took a breather today from recent record-setting highs, with both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) posting losses.Today's stock marketIndex Percentage Change Point ChangeDow (0.23%) (54.67)S&P 500 (0.40%) (10.23)DATA SOURCE: YAHOO!

Consumer stocks were also weak; the Consumer Discretionary Select SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLY) fell 0.7%.As for individual stocks, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) and Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) both announced quarterly results that beat expectations, but each company's shares moved in opposite directions.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Seagate's quarter wasn't as bad as fearedShares of computer storage vendor Seagate Technology soared 12.6% after the company announced revenue and earnings that beat analyst expectations. Revenue fell 5.9% from the year before to $2.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.96, down from $0.99 last year. Wall Street had been expecting non-GAAP EPS of $0.85 on revenue of $2.52 billion. On a GAAP basis, fully diluted EPS actually rose 12.7% from $0.55 to $0.62.""The results of our performance this quarter reflect solid execution and market demand for our storage product portfolio,"" said CEO Dave Mosley in the press release. ""Seagate delivered record levels of exabyte shipments and generated sequential growth in revenue and profit. As the demand for storage continues to benefit from the proliferation of data, Seagate is in a strong position to grow its businesses, improve profitability and continue with its shareholder–return objectives.""Seagate is seeing growing demand from enterprises building up cloud computing capabilities and from consumers buying gaming computers with large storage needs. But that demand hasn't translated into top-line growth for the company, and free cash flow this quarter was only about one-fourth of what it was in the period a year ago. Still, the results were not as bad as what observers had feared, and the company talked up its participation in a consortium to buy Toshiba's memory chip unit, assuring a supply of critically important NAND memory in the future.Hasbro takes the fun out of nice resultsToymaker Hasbro reported third-quarter results that beat expectations for both revenue and profit, but gave guidance for the next quarter that was significantly below what analysts had projected, and the stock got punished, dropping 8.6%. Revenue was up 7% from last year to $1.79 billion, compared to expectations of $1.78 billion, and net income increased 3% to $265.6 million, or $2.09 per share, where analysts were looking for $1.94 per share. Guidance for Q4 revenue was for an increase of between 4% and 7%, compared with expectations of 11.7% and last year's gain of 11%. Hasbro saw the strongest growth in its gaming segment, up 22%, and its emerging brands business, which grew 9% in the quarter. But the company cited the bankruptcy of Toy R Us and ""challenging economic environment"" in the U.K. and Brazil for headwinds this quarter and next.""As a result of the Toys""R""Us bankruptcy filing in the U.S. and Canada, there was a negative impact on our quarterly revenues and operating profit,"" said CEO Brian Goldner in the press release. ""However, our multi-platform content strategy, combined with an industry leading investment in innovation and an omni-channel commercial approach, is driving strong consumer takeaway heading into the holiday season as consumers engage with Hasbro brands across a multitude of experiences.""No doubt the retailer's bankruptcy is going to present some challenges for the company for several quarters. But given today's decent results and Hasbro's consistent performance over the long term, the market's reaction seems a little short-sighted."
3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks I'd Buy Right Now,"Sep 17, 2017 at 8:17AM","""Yield"" means to give in or give up when the term is used outside the investing world. That definition isn't too far off when it comes to some dividend stocks. Those stocks might pay high yields, but investors have to give up a lot for those yields, including peace of mind that the dividend is sustainable.There are several high-yield dividend stocks, though, that I think are solid picks over the long run. Here's why AT&T (NYSE:T), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) are three stocks with attractive yields that I'd buy right now.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.AT&TAT&T claims one of the best pedigrees when it comes to dividends of any stock. The telecommunications giant sports a fantastic yield of 5.41%. It's also a Dividend Aristocrat, with an impressive record of 33 consecutive years of dividend increases.I don't see any reason to think that AT&T won't keep that long streak of dividend increases going. The company does use a relatively high 92% of earnings to fund the dividend program, but that's not a big concern, considering its rock-solid cash flow.More importantly, though, AT&T seems poised for decent long-term earnings growth. Assuming the pending acquisition of Time Warner gets a thumbs-up from regulators, AT&T will get a large content library to help it compete in the wireless cable market. And the company has started rolling out its high-speed 5G network that should make AT&T a major force in the Internet of Things and self-driving-car markets.AT&T stock also looks attractive from a valuation perspective. Shares trade at only 12 times expected earnings. With its nice yield and reasonable growth prospects, AT&T appears to be a top-tier candidate for income-seeking investors. IBMThere's a lot to like about IBM's dividend also. The big technology company's yield currently stands at 4.12%. Even better, IBM's payout ratio of roughly 47%, along with its strong cash flow, should give the company plenty of flexibility for dividend increases in the future.IBM does come with a catch, though: The technology giant has reported year-over-year revenue declines for 21 quarters in a row. And although IBM posted earnings growth in its last quarter, that improvement stemmed from a tax benefit rather than good news from its business operations. So is there good news for IBM? Yes. The company continues to enjoy robust growth for its mobile and cloud services. IBM recently introduced a new mainframe computer that should boost revenue. Because IBM makes a lot of its money internationally, a weaker U.S. dollar should help as well. Over the longer term, IBM's expertise and leadership in artificial intelligence could be an even greater factor for the company's fortunes. In the meantime, IBM stock looks pretty cheap. Shares trade at less than 11 times expected earnings. Although the company isn't expected to generate impressive growth in the near term, IBM's dividend and long-term prospects seem solid. Seagate TechnologyIf you're searching for a super-high yield, check out Seagate Technology. The data-storage manufacturer's dividend yields 7.9%. There are a few knocks against Seagate, though. Seagate is currently spending nearly all of its earnings to fund the dividend program, which doesn't bode well for dividend increases in the immediate future. And its yield is really high in part because Seagate stock has dropped more than 30% in the past six months.So why buy Seagate Technology stock? Its problems should be temporary. Over the long run, demand for data storage will inevitably increase. Seagate is one of the top competitors in the market. It has a strong cash flow that should allow the company to retain its position as a key leader in data storage.The stock's valuation also looks attractive, particularly after the big slump this year. Seagate shares trade at less than nine times expected earnings. The consensus among Wall Street analysts is that the company will be able to grow earnings at 18% annually over the next five years. Even if Seagate's actual performance comes in well below those projections, its growth prospects make the stock look even more appealing for dividend-hunting investors who also like a bargain.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 High-Yield Stocks for Aggressive Investors,"Oct 6, 2017 at 6:12AM","Aggressive investors are more than willing to accept higher levels of risk to get the potential for high returns. Many think of aggressive investors in terms of chasing growth, but some of these investors focus more on high yields.If you're an aggressive investor looking for high-yield stocks, you have plenty of options from which to choose. We asked three Motley Fool investors to pick stocks with high yields that could carry more risk. Here's why they identified Energy Transfer Partners (NYSE:ETP), DineEquity (NYSE:DIN), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX). IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.A sky-high yield that just might pay offMatt DiLallo (Energy Transfer Partners): Oil and gas pipeline giant Energy Transfer Partners currently yields a jaw-dropping 11.8%. That said, the reason it's that high is that investors aren't sure the company can maintain its current rate over the long term. Fueling those fears are its elevated leverage ratio, massive capex requirements, and the high management fees it pays to its parent.While those are valid concerns, Energy Transfer believes it can navigate around them. That's because the company is in the midst of an enormous expansion phase that should fuel significant earnings and cash flow growth over the next few years. In Energy Transfer's estimation, those projects will provide a big-enough boost so that it can raise its payout by a double-digit rate in the near term, while fully supporting an increase in fees to its parent and reducing its leverage ratio.There's a huge risk, however, that Energy Transfer will fall short of this ambitious forecast, especially if it can't raise the capital it needs to finance its growth projects at competitive rates, which might force it to reduce its payout and use that money to fund growth. However, if it can get that job done and maintain its distribution, investors who are willing to make an aggressive gamble and invest amid the uncertainty could reap a windfall of profits.A high-yield restaurant stockTim Green (DineEquity): How does a profitable restaurant stock that yields an astounding 9% sound? DineEquity, which operates and franchises restaurants under the Applebee's and IHOP brands, is exactly that. The stock has been hammered since peaking in early 2015, down about 60% from its high, creating a high-yield opportunity for investors.But don't jump into DineEquity without understanding the problems facing the company. Both the Applebee's and IHOP brands are not exactly thriving, and Applebee's in particular is struggling mightily. Through the first six months of this year, systemwide comparable sales at Applebee's are down 7%. DineEquity attempted to rebrand Applebee's in recent years to appeal to younger customers, but that effort has been abandoned due to lackluster results.DineEquity is still plenty profitable. The company expects to produce free cash flow between $76 million and $86 million this year, a healthy double-digit percentage of revenue. The stock trades for around 10 times this free cash flow guidance, reflecting pessimism about the company's ability to turn things around. Nearly all of this free cash flow will be eaten up by the dividend, which yields 9%.DineEquity, then, is only for investors willing to bet that the Applebee's and IHOP brands can be turned around and that the company can halt the ongoing earnings decline before it endangers the dividend. A dividend cut is possible down the line, but if you're an aggressive investor looking for a high yield, DineEquity might be for you.Hard-drive maker falling on hard timesKeith Speights (Seagate Technology): First, the bad news about my pick. Seagate Technology missed revenue and earnings expectations in its last quarter. The stock is down more than 10% so far in 2017. And the hard-drive maker just had a change at the top, with former president and COO David Mosley taking over as CEO. If you're an aggressive investor looking for high dividend yields, though, all of this could make Seagate an even more attractive opportunity.Seagate's dividend currently yields around 7.5%. I wouldn't count on dividend hikes from the company anytime soon, since it's using nearly all of its earnings to fund the dividend program. But with that kind of yield, who really cares if no increases are forthcoming?The obvious question is: What about the potential for dividend cuts? I don't see that happening, either. Seagate's payout ratio might be higher than ideal, but it's not so high that the company should have to slash its dividend. In addition, Seagate is generating solid cash flow that should allow it to easily keep dividends coming at current levels.And while Seagate's latest financial results were disappointing, the long-term outlook for the company still appears to be good overall. Demand for data storage should increase in the future, particularly with continued growth in cloud computing. Seagate remains one of the top players in the market. Aggressive investors could find this an attractive high-yield stock to add to their portfolios."
3 High-Yield Stocks Still Worth Buying,"Oct 11, 2017 at 8:47PM","Sky-high dividend yields can be tricky beasts. Sometimes, those extreme payouts can be signs of a deep rot in the underlying business, based on nothing but terribly low share prices and a dream. In other cases, the rich yield really does tell the whole story, and that stock could be a great income stock for serious investors.One way to tell the difference between the winners and losers is to ask for some help. So we asked a handful of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool to share their best high-yield investment ideas.Read on to see why our panelists could see themselves buying Oaktree Capital Group (NYSE: OAK), China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), despite the possible warning flags that are hanging from their extreme dividend yields.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.This high-yield stock should rise when others fallJordan Wathen (Oaktree Capital Group): This alternative asset manager is a great company to own for the simple reason that its business gets better when stock and bond prices fall, making it a great high-yield stock for diversifying a portfolio.Oaktree's sterling reputation as a credit investor allows it to charge both management fees and incentive fees on most of its funds in its line-up. Thus, when its investment performance is particularly good, Oaktree gets a slice of the profits right off the top.These incentive fees are what power Oaktree Capital Group's ability to earn outsize returns for its own shareholders. Thanks to its post-crisis successes, Oaktree had about $5.55 of net accrued incentive fees per share on its balance sheet as of June 30. In the next few years, these incentive fees will be collected in cash as Oaktree's older funds wind down, and will help support its juicy 7% dividend yield.Should asset prices fall -- which is what you want to happen if you're an Oaktree shareholder -- the company has about $21.5 billion of its $99 billion of assets under management on standby, sitting on the sidelines for a particularly juicy investment opportunity. With still more gains to harvest, and plenty of capital for its next buying binge, I think Oaktree is a great stock to own at a price between $45 and $50 per share.This Chinese giant is serious about strong dividendsAnders Bylund (China Mobile): It's hard to bet against a global market leader. China Mobile is the largest hardwired and wireless telecom in the Middle Kingdom, serving 873 million wireless subscribers and 99 million broadband lines.The Big Four networks over here would kill for numbers like that. The next two mobile rivals add up to just 508 million subscribers, giving China Mobile a stranglehold on the Chinese cellphone market.That unimpeachable market position generates $106 billion in annual revenues, and $36 billion of the top-line haul is preserved as free cash flows. 80% of the cash profits is sent right back to shareholders in the form of dividend payments. That's enough to fuel a meaty 5.5% dividend yield at today's share prices.China Mobile may not be a traditional income investment, since its dividend checks vary from one payout to the next, and not always upward. But we're talking about an unstoppable giant that is taking full advantage of the thriving Chinese economy, and is no afraid to reward shareholders with a heaping serving of fully cash flow-powered dividends.In my book, that's makes China Mobile a solid income-generating investment for the long term. Extreme dividend yields can be warning flags of fundamental business problems, but there's none of that going on with this massive telecom.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Stack dividends with this storage companyKeith Noonan (Seagate Technology): Seagate Technology trades at just nine times forward earnings estimates and packs a roughly 7.5% dividend yield. Those metrics are likely to pique the interest of value-minded investors, but it's still important to understand why the stock has dropped nearly 30% over the past six months to put its long-term prospects in context. Seagate derives most of its revenues from the sale of hard drives -- roughly 91% last quarter. With cloud storage technologies on the rise, some investors are worried that one of the company's biggest sales pillars will weaken over the long term.In the near term, Seagate's more profitable hard drive offerings face competition from its own solid state drives and those from rival companies. Seagate is also still reeling after delivering disappointing fourth-quarter results in July, which saw both sales and earnings come in far below analyst estimates. With those pressures in mind, I still think the stock looks like an appealing play for income investors at current prices. The need for data storage is almost certain to grow in the long run, and Seagate is making shifts to ensure that it remains competitive in the space. Consumer cloud use will increase, but this will still create demand for hard drives on the back end, and the stock's substantial returned income component will do a lot to smooth over near-term pressures. 10 stocks we like better than China MobileWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 High-Yield International Stocks,"Oct 3, 2017 at 3:30PM","Most investors fail to look beyond their home country's borders for investment opportunities. That's a shame because great businesses can be found all around the world.Want proof? We asked a team to highlight an international stock that they believe is a good choice for income-focused investors. Here's why they picked Sanofi (NYSE:SNY), Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), and National Grid (NYSE:NGG).IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.A quick turnaroundGeorge Budwell (Sanofi): With an annualized trailing dividend yield of 6.94% and a reasonable payout ratio of 79.2%, French pharma giant Sanofi may be a particularly appealing stock for investors looking for top-notch income opportunities abroad. However, they may want to consider this pharma titan before its stock climbs much higher. Sanofi's stock, after all, has produced an outstanding 35% total return on capital over the past 12 months, making it one of the best-performing large-cap pharma equities during this period. Sanofi's shares have steadily been marching higher lately for two core reasons. First, the company's reorganization efforts have helped to blunt the impact of generic competition for its top-selling diabetes drug Lantus, whereby keeping its top line moving in the right direction. Sanofi's annual sales, for example, are forecast to rise at an impressive compound annual growth rate of 9.08% over the next two years. Second, the recent Food and Drug Administration approval of Sanofi's anti-inflammatory medicine, Dupixent, as a treatment for adults with moderate to severe eczema should keep the growth party going for a while longer. By 2023, for instance, Dupixent is expected to generate nearly $3 billion in annual sales and become one of the best-selling drugs in the world, according to EvaluatePharma. All in all, there aren't many high-yield stocks that can offer both respectable growth prospects, and a payout ratio that won't keep you awake at night. Sanofi's stock, though, appears to be one of the few rare exceptions. ""Store"" this 7% yield away for a long time Sean Williams (Seagate Technology): When it comes to high-yield international stocks, perhaps none offers a more delectable yield than data storage solutions provider Seagate Technology.On one hand, investors have to be aware that the company's current yield of 7.5% is a factor of both a falling share price (its shares are down 12% year to date) and weaker near-term results. For example, Seagate's fiscal fourth-quarter sales of $2.41 billion dropped from $2.65 billion in the year-ago quarter and missed Wall Street's expectations. The company blamed the weaker sales from enterprise customers in China, as well as weakness in data storage systems in Q4. Since yield is a function of share price, Seagate's share price weakness has lifted its yield to north of 7%. However, these short-term concerns should give way to long-term growth.Seagate has devoted practically all of its attention to growing its cloud-storage solutions. Of the 62.2 exabytes shipped in the fourth quarter, 23.4 went to enterprise customers. Of that 23.4, roughly 90% was designated for nearline applications, such as cloud computing, content delivery, and backup services. This push into the cloud --which is set to grow significantly larger because of growth in the internet, Internet of Things, big data analytics, mobility via smartphones, and media-rich video -- has been a transformative factor that's helped lift Seagate's margins. After its quarterly adjusted gross margin hovered between 22.7% and 27.2% in 2016, it jumped to between 28.9% and 31.8% in all four quarters of 2017. Expect the cloud to continue to drive results, and higher margins, for Seagate.While the company's client and consumer businesses, which include consumer electronics as well as desktops and laptops, should continue to provide healthy cash flow, innovation within its enterprise segment will also be a driving force. Earlier this year, Seagate unveiled its 12 terabyte (TB) helium enterprise drives, allowing it to escalate its product offerings to enterprise customers and go toe to toe with main rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). Seagate's CFO believes it could have 50% of the exabyte share within the 10 TB and 12 TB market by the end of the current calendar year. Though cyclical, Seagate has a lot to offer patient income- and value-seeking investors over the long haul.Not your average utility Brian Feroldi (National Grid): When investors think of the utility sector, they most likely picture a series of power plants that crank out electricity by burning fossil fuels. That association makes sense since it is what most utilities do. However, that's not how National Grid operates.Rather than make power itself, National Grid is almost exclusively focused on owning assets that link power producers and consumers together. This primarily consists of electricity and gas lines that are spread throughout the U.K. and northeastern U.S. By focusing heavily on transmission assets National Grid doesn't have to worry about fluctuating fossil fuel prices. In turn, its business is incredibly predictable, which allows management to safely pass along the bulk of profits to shareholders in the form of a rising dividend (which at current prices yields 4.6%).  So how does a company focused on transmission assets grow? The answer is that regulators allow National Grid to raise prices every now and again to ensure that it earns acceptable returns on investments that beef up its infrastructure. Regulators know that they need to incentivize companies like National Grid to do so -- otherwise, the grid wouldn't be nearly as reliable. While the returns vary from region to region, National Grid is typically allowed to earn between 8% and 14% on asset improvements. Given the healthy return potential, National Grid expands its asset base (and hence its earnings) by about 5% to 7% annually. While high-single-digit growth won't cause National Grid's stock to double anytime soon, the low-risk nature of its business model makes this a stock that investors can count on. When adding in the modest growth potential, I think National Grid is a great stock for investors who crave stability. 10 stocks we like better than SanofiWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Seagate Technology Had a Good Quarter,"Jan 26, 2018 at 7:47AM","Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) has been in fine form of late, appreciating over 30% in the past six months thanks to a better-than-expected quarterly report in October 2017. The data storage specialist trumped earnings expectations by a wide margin because of stringent cost controls, thereby boosting investor confidence.The company is set to report second-quarter results on Jan. 29. Investors have already gotten a look at some of the numbers and will be tuning in to get the full picture next week. IMAGE SOURCE: SEAGATE.Preliminary results indicate continue improvementSeagate announced selected preliminary second-quarter results on Jan. 8 and the stock climbed in response. The company noted that it will be reporting $2.9 billion in second-quarter revenue, as well as a non-GAAP gross margin of 30%. This compares favorably to Seagate's original expectation of $2.73 billion in revenue, indicating that demand for its storage products and solutions is improving.In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Seagate's revenue was down almost 6% year over year. Now in the second quarter, the company's revenue will remain flat compared to the prior-year period. This improvement in Seagate's top line is a result of an increase in demand for the company's hard-disk drives (HDDs).Seagate shipped a record 88 exabytes of storage capacity during the second quarter, up 29% over the prior-year quarter, and the average capacity per HDD rose from 1.7 terabytes last year to 2.2 terabytes (TB) this time. Meanwhile, the number of HDD units shipped by Seagate remained constant at 40 million. This increase in the average capacity per drive has helped Seagate reduce its operating expenses substantially.This is because HDDs with a higher storage capacity have a lower per-gigabyte cost, so they carry stronger margins. As a result, Seagate's operating expenses will decline almost 15% from the prior-year period, and this should help the company's bottom line.Seagate looks set to deliver another round of appealing quarterly results, and a strong guidance could be the icing on the cake.Why Seagate's turnaround will continueThere's a growing market for HDD as their cost advantage over solid-state drives makes them ideal to address high-capacity storage requirements in data centers. The cloud storage market is expected to clock a compound annual growth rate of 25.8% through 2021, according to Markets and Markets.This gives Seagate's total capacity shipments the room to run higher and boost its revenue. And the company's strategy of moving toward higher-capacity drives should help it lower costs and enhance margins. For instance, the company sees a market for 16TB hard drives over the next 12 to 18 months.By comparison, the top-selling enterprise storage product in Seagate's lineup has a capacity of 10TB. As it stands, sales of its 10TB HDDs shot up threefold in the September-ended quarter as compared to the previous quarter. Meanwhile, Seagate had earlier reported that its 12TB storage product has also started gaining traction, and this could have been one of the key drivers behind the jump in capacity shipments in the quarter.The good news is that Seagate will continue pushing the envelope on HDD capacity. The company is reportedly working on a 20TB HDD that it plans to bring to the market in 2019. But before that, it is expected to launch a 16TB HDD this year to take the throne of the highest-capacity HDD provider from rival Western Digital.Seagate will report its results before the market opens Jan. 29 and management will hold a conference call with analysts at 9 a.m. Eastern time. Investors can access the event at the company's investor relations website.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Seagate Technology PLC Stock Rose 32% in January,"Feb 5, 2018 at 12:00PM","What happenedShares of Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) gained 31.9% in January, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Strong business results did the heavy lifting for this hard-drive maker, but Seagate also got a boost from a large cryptocurrency investment.So whatSeagate shares rose 7% on Jan. 8 alone, driven by unofficial reports that the company was an early investor in Ripple. That company backs the eponymous Ripple cryptocurrency, or XRP, which has grown into one of the largest crypto-coins on the market today. The value of the tokens has skyrocketed 113 times higher over the last 12 months, so if Seagate's early investment included any ownership of XRP coins, that would have potentially added billions of dollars to Seagate's enterprise value. Its investment in Ripple also positions Seagate as an early adopter and supporter of blockchain technologies, though it's unclear exactly how that foresight might help a maker of data-storage hardware.The company pre-announced its second-quarter results that day, adding fuel to the fire with surprisingly strong top-line sales and wider profit margins. Three weeks later, the final report added color commentary and fuller financial details, but the basic story was still the same: Seagate is selling a lot of enterprise-grade hard drives these days.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Now whatI happen to prefer Seagate's archrival, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), for the simple reason that it seems better positioned for long-term success in a world that's moving deeper into solid-state storage devices. But Seagate has found a comfortable niche where its focus on reliable and affordable bulk storage might keep it relevant for a few more years. And the company is attempting to address the SSD issue by partnering up with major memory-chip supplier Toshiba (NASDAQOTH:TOSBF).Between surprisingly solid hard-drive sales and that forward-thinking Ripple investment, Seagate sure seems to be on a roll right now. I'm not convinced that the market momentum will carry this stock much higher, but many investors were optimistic in January.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is Seagate Technology a Buy at Its 52-Week High?,"Apr 2, 2018 at 10:08PM","Seagate Technology's (NASDAQ:STX) recent recovery has been rewarded handsomely by investors. Shares of the storage specialist have soared remarkably over the past few months and as of this writing sit at 52-week high, thanks largely to impressive cost control measures and the increasing demand for its storage products and solutions.But concerns have been raised about the sustainability of Seagate's terrific run as rival Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) aggressive move into the solid-state drive (SSD) business after the SanDisk acquisition has given it an upper hand.STX DATA BY YCHARTSWhat's more, Western Digital has set itself up for long-term growth thanks to the growing demand for flash-based storage, while Seagate continues to bet on the legacy hard-disk drive (HDD) market. So, will Seagate's strategy of sticking to the HDD business pay off in the long run and help the stock soar higher? Let's take a look.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Seagate's HDDs are gaining tractionSeagate's focus on the HDD market, as opposed to the fast-growing SSD market, has weighed on its top line in recent quarters, but things are gradually improving. For instance, revenue in the December-ended quarter revenue was flat year over year, and its top line should remain in good shape thanks to the positive end-market dynamics.PC shipments, for example, are finally getting better. Gartner estimates that PC sales will rise by 2 million units in 2018, and gain more traction in 2019 with sales expected to rise by 3 million units. The market was at 270 million units in 2016.Meanwhile, enterprise cloud storage is expected to grow at almost 24% a year through 2022, driven by the growing demand for hybrid cloud storage and other applications such as enterprise mobile management. HDDs are expected to play a crucial role in satisfying this demand thanks to their cost advantage over solid-state drives.A 512GB HDD, for example, retails online in a range of $44 to $65, while an SSD with identical capacity goes for anywhere between $140 to $170, according to data storage provider Backblaze. Demand for Seagate's HDD products has taken off in recent quarters as data centers need a cost-effective solution to store such large amounts of data. The company shipped 87.5 exabytes of HDD capacity last quarter, up 28% from the prior-year period.Looking ahead, Seagate should be able to maintain its hold on the enterprise storage market thanks to its focus on coming out with larger HDDs, which should also boost margins.Seagate's earnings power will improveSeagate's focus on optimizing its operational efficiency has led to massive cost reductions in recent quarters as it has scaled down its manufacturing footprint. Last year, the company had announced that it was shutting down one of its largest HDD manufacturing plants in China as the market is moving toward higher-capacity drives.In fact, Seagate's average capacity per drive increased to 2.2 TB last quarter as compared to 1.7 TB in the year-ago period. As a result, the number of HDD units the company shipped fell slightly year over year last quarter -- so Seagate now needs to make fewer hard drives because it is packing more memory into each unit, leading to a leaner manufacturing footprint.This is why the company's operating expenses fell 15% year over year last quarter. What's more, Seagate expects its operating expenses to drop another 2% to 3% sequentially in the current quarter. More importantly, the company should be able to limit its expenses in the long run as it is working on the introduction of higher-capacity drives.Seagate recently started pilot shipments of hard drives based on Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) technology and expects to start shipping HDDs with 20 TB-plus capacities by next year. By comparison, Seagate's 10 TB and 12 TB products are currently its best-selling offerings.So, the company is looking to aggressively push up the storage density of its drives, and it aims to roll out HDDs with capacities of 40 TB or higher by 2023. Seagate believes that this increase in the storage density of an HDD will allow data center operators to reduce the total cost of operation significantly.Moreover, the company should be able to consolidate its manufacturing footprint further by making bigger HDDs, which should lead to lower operating expenses and bigger profits. Analysts expect Seagate's earnings to increase at 8.4% a year for the next five years. By comparison, the company's bottom line has shrunk by almost 9% a year for the past five years.Attractively valuedSeagate's valuation indicates that there's still room for more upside. The stock's trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.6 is much lower than rival Western Digital's P/E of almost 80. What's more, Seagate stock gets cheaper on a forward P/E basis with a multiple of just 12.Also, Seagate's dividend yield of 4.2% gives investors yet another solid reason to invest in the stock despite its terrific run in recent months. All in all, the company is making smart moves to tap the growing storage demand, trades at an attractive valuation, and carries a hefty dividend yield, so there's no reason why investors shouldn't think of adding Seagate shares to their portfolio.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Why Tesla, Weight Watchers International, and Seagate Technology Jumped Today","Jan 8, 2018 at 4:31PM","Monday continued the positive string of stock market performances for 2018, as major benchmarks largely bounced back from losses early in the session to finish with modest gains. Sentiment among investors has been extremely high to start the year, helping to spur advances but also raising concerns that exuberance on Wall Street might be reaching irrational levels. Nevertheless, good news affecting key individual companies helped to support market indexes, and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Weight Watchers International (NYSE:WTW), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.Tesla revs upShares of Tesla picked up 6%, bouncing back from subpar performance last week as investors regained confidence in the electric vehicle manufacturer's ability to capitalize on a lucrative market opportunity. Last week, Tesla disappointed investors when it announced fourth-quarter vehicle delivery numbers that included fewer-than-expected Model 3 deliveries. Yet the company argued that focusing on quality and efficiency was smarter than simply getting production numbers up, and although it took a few days, shareholders seemed eventually to buy into that argument. With potential not only for the Model 3 but also battery production and other groundbreaking innovations, Tesla still captures the imagination of forward-looking enthusiasts -- even if some say its stock price has already gotten ahead of itself.IMAGE SOURCE: TESLA.Oprah speculation lifts Weight WatchersShares of Weight Watchers International climbed 12% after investors responded positively to a speech given by company spokesperson and major shareholder Oprah Winfrey at the Golden Globe Awards Sunday night. Winfrey has denied that she intends to run in the 2020 presidential election, but some believe that she might change her mind in the next couple of years. Given that Weight Watchers has now identified itself very closely with Winfrey, many shareholders are tying the futures of the two together. Investors still need to watch fundamental business performance at this key time of the year for the weight-loss business, but publicity linked to Winfrey could help gain attention for Weight Watchers.Seagate ripples higherFinally, shares of Seagate Technology rose 7%. The data-storage specialist became the latest stock to jump in response to cryptocurrency fever, as rumors surfaced that Seagate might have a significant position in the company behind the rising crypto play Ripple. The website for the cryptocurrency company identified Seagate as an early investor in past rounds of capital raising, although it doesn't state whether Seagate retained its interest. Ripple has recently challenged ethereum for the No. 2 spot behind bitcoin in terms of total market value of outstanding coin, with dramatic gains in 2017 that dwarfed what the other two cryptocurrencies produced. Yet without confirmation, any gains from speculation could easily reverse themselves once the facts come out.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level trends we're seeing in the business, our CFO, Dave Morton, will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the March quarter.Beginning with our operational results for the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 1% year over year, GAAP gross margins of 30.1% and a net income of $159 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.55, including a one-time provision for income taxes of $208 million related to tax reform. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 30.4%, net income of $431 million, up 5% year over year, and diluted earnings per share of $1.48, up 7% year over year.HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were a record 87.5 exabytes, up 28% year over year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was also a record 2.2 terabytes per drive, up 29% year over year, and the average selling price per unit was $68.00, up 3% year over year. GAAP operating expenses were $444 million, down 15% year over year, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $390 million, also down 15% year over year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $850 million, up 30% year over year, and free cash flow was $773 million, up 38% year over year.Achieving revenue and profitability growth and significant cash flow generation in the December quarter reflects Seagate's strong execution and the competitiveness of our storage portfolio, particularly in cloud-based environments, as the average capacity per drive continues to grow rapidly. I'm very pleased at the traction we've gained with our mass storage solutions across the enterprise, edge, and consumer markets.In addition to the solid December quarter results, in January, we announced that Seagate has entered into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba memory. This agreement will provide continuity of NAND supply for our expanding product portfolio. We have matured our entire technology portfolio over the last several years, and today, we have a broad offering of flash-based products that are ready to scale and grow across multiple markets.Diversifying and expanding our competitive HDD mass storage portfolio with SSD and enterprise storage solutions will enable meaningful future revenue growth and profits over the next several years while providing significant value for our storage customers. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activities.David H. Morton -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks, Dave. For the December quarter, we achieved year-over-year revenue and profitability growth with record exabyte shipments of 87.5 exabytes and record average capacity per drive of 2.2 terabytes. For the enterprise HDD market, we shipped a record 37.4 exabytes with a record average capacity of 4.3 terabytes per drive. In the nearline market, we shipped 35.1 exabytes and our average capacity drive reached 5.9 terabytes per drive, up 31% over last year's strong demand and up 75% from the December quarter two years ago.Overall, HDD revenue was up 2% year over year in the December quarter. The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these environments.Our 10TB nearline product was the leading enterprise revenue SKU in the December quarter. In addition, we achieved sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12TB nearline product as we continue to ramp from material revenue contribution in the March quarter. As nearline capacity demand continues to grow, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. Use cases will cause capacity points to span from 2 to 4TB for certain applications and up to 16TB for other customer needs. At Seagate, we believe we're well poised to help our cloud customers with their stringent and diverse requirements.Looking ahead, cloud-based enterprise market demand continues to be strong and supply remains bid-constrained. In the enterprise market, the long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending in the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies continues to have significant velocity. Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality, and total-cost-of-ownership benefits.Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership with generations of storage technologies and products. Over the last five years, we've been the leader in areal density with our SMR and TDMR areal density solutions, and we continue to make progress toward the introduction of our Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording -- or HAMR -- technology, which will open up a rich space for high capacity and great value. We anticipate launching our HAMR portfolio in 2019 and the future investment costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditure long-term model.In the edge and consumer verticals, we had a strong year-over-year exabyte growth in almost all end markets, including PC compute, consumer, surveillance, gaming, and NAS markets. Our 1TB-per-platter 2.5"" platform continues to perform well. Using our areal density advantage, our 2TB-per-platter 3.5"" platform continues to ramp for desktop markets, providing a great value for customers needing a 2, 4, and 8TB capacity point.In addition to positioning ourselves for growth in the silicon business, we continue to minimize our alignment with the 500GB client, consumer, and mission-critical 15K hard drive markets, as we believe these workloads will, over time, move to mobile silicon cloud storage. In the December quarter, these products represented less than 8% of our total consolidated revenue. December quarter non-HDD revenue -- primarily from the cloud systems and silicon group -- was $213 million, down 12% year over year, mostly due to the divesting of our high-performance computing assets and OEM legacy system demand.Looking ahead, we continue to be bullish about our opportunities to leverage our long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory Corporation for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions of our silicon product portfolio and SAS, SSD, PCIe, NBMe, consumer, and gaming markets. This value creation is above and beyond the base economics previously disclosed with our equity commandment letter for Seagate to invest up to $1.25 billion with the Bain-led consortium acquisition of the Toshiba Memory Corporation.We believe that our strategic approach to the participation in the silicon market allows us to address customer storage portfolio needs and provide for revenue growth opportunities in our business model without overhang from additional capital requirements and cyclical market exposure.Operating expenses for the December quarter were $444 million on a GAAP basis and $390 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 15% year over year. We remain on track to exit the fiscal year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $375 million per quarter. Capital expenditures were $77 million for the December quarter for supporting the continued ramp of our new highest-capacity HDD products and maintenance capital. For the March quarter, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million, primarily for maintenance capital and some incremental capital to address the strong cloud market demand. We anticipate capital expenditures to remain less than 5% of our total consolidated revenue for FY '18.Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $850 million and free cash flow was $773 million. These results include approximately $34 million of cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges. For the first half of the fiscal year, we have generated nearly $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations, including $80 million in cash payments against restructuring charges and nearly $900 million in free cash flow.Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the December quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 285 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the December quarter, which will be payable on April 4th of 2018. Interest expense for the December quarter was $61 million. Our debt structure and levels of interest expense continue to be well within our financial capabilities given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. In the December quarter, we deployed $130 million toward redeeming our November 2018 senior notes. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continues to trend down and is 1.1 times as of the December quarter.As Dave Mosley mentioned, in the December quarter, we made a one-time provision for income tax adjustment of $208 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Specifically, the company recorded a one-time reduction of $208 million to earnings due to the remeasurements of our U.S. deferred tax assets at the lower enacted 21% corporate tax rate, which has no cash impact. The deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and profits to be taxed at 15.5% for liquid assets and 8% for non-liquid assets is not impactful for Seagate because our U.S. corporation has no unrepatriated earnings. The interest expense disallowance impact will be minor since Seagate does not have significant long-term debt held in the U.S.We believe that the impact of the international provisions -- including the global and tangible low-taxed income provision and the foreign-derived intangible income, and the base erosion anti-avoidance tax -- will be minimal to Seagate. In summary, Seagate has evaluated the impact of the most significant provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We do not expect the tax act to materially impact Seagate's effective tax rate going forward.As we consider future use cases for storage growth, we invest in companies that align to our long-term thesis of exponential data growth and new verticals, some of which are outlined in the Data Age 2025 Report with IBC. A few years ago, we made an investment in Ripple, a company driving technology innovation for distributed ledger and blockchain use cases.We believe the proliferation of these companies will create tremendous amounts of data, require high levels of data integrity, and will alleviate friction in global financial operations and other important use cases that require the transfer of value with improved agility and transparency. While recent attention is on the valuation of the XRP crypto assets, we believe Ripple has a real and robust blockchain technology platform, a defined and validated use case for XRP, and a leading management team.Overall, our operational and financial performance in the December quarter reflects execution of our business model and profitability improvement objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business and focus on aligning our go-to-market and product portfolio advancements toward the future growth opportunity markets. I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley.Dr. Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Dave. The Seagate team has focused for the past two years on reducing our operational footprint and reshaping our cost structure to address the current demand environment. Our supply chain -- from suppliers, to factories, to sales and fulfillment -- is now entirely focused on agility and flexibility for our customers. I'm proud of the team for completing our significant restructuring plans, and while we will always have cost reduction efforts, we are well-positioned to shift our focus as a company to capturing new market opportunities and achieving sustainable revenue growth and profitability.Turning to our market outlook, we remain conservatively optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment as well as spending trends for cloud-based environments. On the heels of the various IT component supply constraints we witnessed over the last year or so, we're continuing to monitor outgoing inventory closely. From Seagate's vantage point, our channel inventory positions and inventory for our customers that are visible to us are, in general, lower than last year.For the March quarter, we anticipate year-over-year exabyte growth with continued strong demand in cloud storage as supply remains tight in our highest-capacity solutions. For the other markets we serve, we anticipate normal sequential seasonal demand declines. As a result of the strong cloud demand and seasonality in our other markets, we expect total revenues to be down 5% to 7% sequentially from the December quarter. This represents lower sequential revenue declines than the last few years and year-over-year revenue growth for Seagate.We expect gross margins to be sequentially in line with the December quarter's gross margins and continue to be within our 29% to 33% long-term range. Non-GAAP operating expenses will be down sequentially 2% to 3% with further cost containment measures as we continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of fiscal '18. In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, employees, suppliers, and business partners for their contributions to our quarter's results. Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers.Questions and Answers:OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press *1 on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may press #. As well, we do ask that as soon as you've asked your question, you place yourself on mute to prevent any background noise. Our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.Katy Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorThank you. Good morning. There was a really nice ramp in gross margins sequentially, but you're still down year on year. Can you talk about what some of the headwinds are that are keeping you from getting back up into that 32%-33% range that you were ago, given how strong cloud is, and is it realistic to think that you can get there over the next three or four quarters? Thank you.Dr. Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive OfficerHi, Katy. I think we were -- I'd characterize it more as flat year over year, but to your point, are there opportunities to move higher? Yes, there are, if the demand picture continues to improve like we saw it do so in the last quarter. I would say that there are some markets -- in particular, we called out the enterprise solutions -- some of the non-HDD assets -- that we're still continuing to pare, so that's work that we have to do. There may have been a slight drag, and I think that we can fix that over time, but there are opportunities if we see the demand picture continue.Katy Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorAnd, can you just comment quickly on how you see free cash flow for the year? If I look historical first-half versus second-half seasonality, that would put you around $1.5 billion, but working capital was really good in December, so do you think you can get higher than that for the full year?David H. Morton -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHi, Katy. We've been confident on some of our previous comments that we thought cash flow from operations would be $2 billion to $2.5 billion, so I still think we're well within that scope. Clearly, when you see strong linearity and strong velocity on the results, you'll see that end up in our working capital, so I think there's a lot of confidence going into the back half of the year.Katy Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorGreat, thank you. Congrats on the quarter.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.Mark Delaney -- Goldman Sachs -- Vice President, Equity ResearchYes, good morning, and thanks very much for the opportunity to ask a question. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on the demand opportunity now that you have the deal in place with Toshiba Memory. Can you give us a sense of what type of scale that may be for Toshiba, either in terms of the number of bits you may be able to procure or the potential revenue you could translate into, is it a market-minus or cost-plus, and then, what sort of go-forward that may look like longer-term? Do your bits scale proportionately with Toshiba or does Seagate get an increased mix of Toshiba's bits as Toshiba adds new factories?Dr. Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive OfficerI think the quick answer is no, I won't go into any of those details. What I will tell you is we have a fairly broad portfolio with which to play the hand, so we have all the way from enterprise even into consumer devices that we can use. We're developing those right now and trying to intercept not only the Toshiba NAND, but all the NAND supply that we can get, and we believe that this is a good chance for us to grow, but we haven't really quantified it yet, and we won't for a while until the deal is finally done.Mark Delaney -- Goldman Sachs -- Vice President, Equity ResearchOkay. I have a follow-up question on market share and the high-capacity hard drive market. Clearly, Seagate is demonstrating improved momentum, which we saw as a result of this quarter. You had your main competitor, WD, talk about trying to come into more of the mid-range market, where I know Seagate has been particularly strong. You've got Toshiba with its first 14TB drive that it's announced, so maybe you could just help us understand how you think about market share and economics in the cloud market this year.Dr. Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive OfficerLet's see. I like our portfolio. There's a lot of times where people tend to fixate on one product versus another. We have a fairly strong product offering across many, so, therefore, when we can satisfy customers who are fairly diverse in their requirements, we will do well. As we talked about before, we've been moving away from some of the lower capacity points over the past year, and that has served us well as well. From a competitive standpoint, all I would say is that from our portfolio's perspective, we're leading in areal density, so we have a lot of flexibility in how to play those components into the various markets.Mark Delaney -- Goldman Sachs -- Vice President, Equity ResearchThank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- AnalystHey, congratulations, guys, on a great start. A follow-up on the enterprise: Your largest competitor was extremely excited about exabyte growth for 2018 in the first half of the year. Are you seeing the same type of order enthusiasm?Dr. Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, as are we. I would say when you compare it to last year, cloud growth was almost nonexistent last year -- exabyte growth was almost nonexistent in some of the quarters last year. I think we ran three quarters in a row with a fairly flat demand profile. If you go back historically over the last five years, it's been 35%, so to your point, to go from 0% over three quarters, there's going to be some backlash -- higher than 35% -- for a while, and we are seeing that demand in calendar '18. When it ends, I don't know at this point, but right now, to the point, we're a bit constrained -- as we've said for the last few weeks -- and we'll continue to chase it.Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- AnalystGreat. And then, as you guys have successfully reshaped your cost structure as well as enhancing your product portfolio with the soon-to-be-addition of NAND, how do you guys view your dividend strategy? I know you guys have outlined what percentage of revenue you want to return, but given that cash flow is maybe well above what a lot of investors may have thought it would have been, as far as capital allocation -- you paid off some debt -- should we be thinking, with further stability of this type of cash flow plus or minus, that a dividend increase is logical at some point?Dr. Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive OfficerLet's see. ""Logical"" is an interesting question. What I would say is a year ago, when we were being asked the question a different way, we remained committed to it. We remained committed to returning value to shareholders via these mechanisms right now. I really don't want to get into the forward-looking pieces of this because, as we've seen, the market can be fairly volatile. I think we're happy with where we are right now.Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- AnalystGreat. No other questions. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.Steven Fox -- Cross Research -- Managing DirectorHi, good morning. I understand that you don't want to get into how you might be receiving bits from the new Toshiba relationship, but can you talk about your own product launches on SSDs, maybe when we could start to see more meaningful commercialization into the rest of the calendar year? And then, I had a quick follow-up.Dr. Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive OfficerThere are product launches -- there are products in qualification right now across NVMe -- multiple flavors of NVMe -- SAS, refresh to the SAS portfolio, and also, SATA products, even consumer products. So, specifically which product, what capacity points -- it's a fairly diverse offering and I think this is reflecting the same thing that's going on in those markets. So, we're fairly happy with it competitively, and I think that's why we think that both on brand strength and customer service, we'll be able to get some revenue growth when the bits all come online, when we intercept all that flash supply and get the technology integrated.Steven Fox -- Cross Research -- Managing DirectorThanks. And then, just as a quick follow-up, it sounds like you're not adding a lot of capacity to meet some of these constraints that you mentioned, so would we expect to see some more of your own internal bit production shift toward high-end capacity products or would you continue to have the same mix the rest of the calendar year?Dr. Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I look at it a little bit differently. We've taken factory footprints down, and as we did that, we had to actually move, and build some buildings, and things like that, so even the capital that we talked about -- 4% to 6% of the range -- we'll start applying some of that capital to bit growth, if you want to look at it that way. We're really pleased with the way that average capacity per drive is moving north and we're going to have the capital there to achieve that kind of growth. Yields are something we continue to work. We've had a lot of focus, obviously, in the factories on moving the things in the last few years as we did this restructuring, but now, we can just focus wholeheartedly on improving our yields, and getting after better equipment utilization, and things like that now that we have the footprint.Steven Fox -- Cross Research -- Managing DirectorGreat, that's very helpful. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Rob Cirha with Guggenheim. Your line is open.Robert Cirha -- Guggenheim Partners -- Managing DirectorHi. Thank you very much. I just want to dig into cloud demand a little more. So, you're clearly benefiting from the cloud CapEx, and you guys have laid out long-term capacity demand growth that you see as strong, but if you look at that market, it has been choppy historically, so can you tell us how you have any -- or, how you get visibility over the next couple of quarters and if there's anything you can do to smooth that out, or are you just always going to be at the mercy of a smaller group of customers? Thanks very much.Dr. Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive OfficerThat's interesting. I think there have been what we call ""digestion cycles"" in the past, where large cloud service providers would buy in big tranches and digest for a while, which means they buy less, relatively. I think we're starting to see more diversification, especially in this last cycle, and it may have been magnified by some of the component supply -- other components, not hard drives -- component supply issues that happened last year, but right now, we see a very healthy, diverse market geographically, by capacity point, by application space, which -- the cloud isn't all about one application space, as people know. There are many different types. So, to your point, helping with that, addressing all those different customers with all their diverse needs, is going to help us get better visibility.Robert Cirha -- Guggenheim Partners -- Managing DirectorMakes sense. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our final question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital -- AnalystHey, good morning guys. I appreciate the questions. Just two real quick ones. The first is going back to gross margin, Dave, and the impact from the systems business that you're pairing off -- how far through that pairing do you believe that you are and how material over time can that impact be to gross margin? I guess back to the envelope, going through the fall, I calculated that it was maybe as much as a 100-basis-point headwind. I don't know if that's accurate, but that was just my calculation. And then, just real quickly, I'll squeak this one in: Has the tightness from cloud demand have you guys begin to engage in supply agreements with key customers? Thanks a lot.Dr. Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive OfficerHi, Ananda. Let's see. On the first point -- gosh, if we start by looking at all the different customers we serve, there are some markets where we were competing with people who didn't necessarily control the core componentry like we do, but they build really cheap. There's a lot of disruption going on in the market; I don't need to tell you guys that. There's a lot of complexity in the market as well, so people can move from solution to solution very quickly. I don't think that's going to be in our bailiwick.I do think that longer-term, it's important that Seagate is able to add value above and beyond the drive at the system level, if you will, and part of the reason for that is we have to do it anyway when we integrate into customers' chassis and so on. I think as you see less -- as you see some of those markets stabilize a little bit, less complexity, it'll be more obvious as to what we should do and which customers, ultimately, we're building for. It's been a turn for us. I think it's going on in other places in the industry as well. Relative to how far are we through that, I can't really tell, but I do think it started five or more years ago, and it's not over yet. So, we're going to do the smart thing. We believe that long-term, it's important that Seagate maintains this kind of ability to understand and add value above the drive.On the second part, I think your question was tightness in the market for enterprise drives, and it's really back to the question Rob asked, which was long-term visibility -- does that give you a better visibility? I think it does. Most of the scale players -- as they sense these kinds of problems -- are actually talking to us quite a bit about longer-term visibility and making sure that our supply chain is properly architected to address their needs. So, hopefully, that helps the demand picture, as I answered Rob, too.Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital -- AnalystGot it. That's very helpful. Thanks a lot.Dr. Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive OfficerGood. With that, thanks, everyone. I'd really like to thank our customers, employees, suppliers, and business partners for their help this last quarter, and we'll talk to you next quarter.OperatorThank you very much.

3 Stocks to Buy With Dividends Yielding More Than 4%,"Mar 25, 2018 at 6:31AM","Sometimes, you're better off walking away from what seems like a great deal. If a person offers to sell you a Rolex for $50, for example, walk away. There are some dividend stocks with high yields that you shouldn't just walk away from -- running away would be the smarter choice.But there are some stocks with dividends yielding more than 4% that I think are solid picks for long-term investors. Here's why Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP), Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) fall into that category.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Brookfield Infrastructure PartnersBrookfield Infrastructure Partners currently offers a dividend yielding nearly 4.6%. In 2017, the global infrastructure giant gave investors even more to like than its nice distributions: Brookfield stock soared nearly 34%.But why is Brookfield Infrastructure Partners still a good stock to buy? My answer is to look at the company's various operations. Brookfield owns cell towers, energy transmission and storage businesses, ports, railroads, toll roads, and more across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. These businesses generate consistent cash flow. Even better, the company can hike its prices on many of these assets as inflation increases.I also like Brookfield's plans for future growth. In November, CEO Sam Pollock listed three areas that Brookfield would focus on: data infrastructure (such as cell towers and telecommunications networks), municipal infrastructure (including central heating and/or cooling systems that serves multiple buildings), and Asian markets. The company thinks that it can deliver 6% to 9% annual growth in funds from operations (FFO) in the coming years. Assuming Brookfield achieves this goal -- which I think it can -- that should translate to similar growth in the dividend distributions. Iron MountainIron Mountain's dividend yield stands north of 7.4%. The company expects to grow its dividend by 4% annually over the next few years. When it comes to records storage and information management, Iron Mountain is in a league of its own. The company has more than 225,000 customers, including a whopping 95% of the Fortune 1000. Although many large customers do business with Iron Mountain, no single customer accounts for more than 1% of total revenue. Iron Mountain is also getting into the data center business in a big way. In December, the company announced that it was acquiring the U.S. operations of Arizona-based colocation data center services provider IO Data Centers for $1.3 billion. Although the stock has fallen so far in 2018, in part due to the stock offering and debt offering the company initiated to fund the IO Data Centers deal, I like the prospects for Iron Mountain over the long run. Organizations continue to churn out more records and data that need to be stored. Iron Mountain appears to be in great shape to grow from increasing demand in these areas.Seagate TechnologySeagate Technology pays a dividend that currently yields 4.2%. The stock only gained 9% in 2017, but so far this year, it's up more than 40%.There are a couple of factors behind Seagate's impressive run in recent months. First, the company reported solid second-quarter results in January. Second, Seagate appears to have been an early investor in Ripple, the cryptocurrency whose valuation has skyrocketed.I wouldn't prioritize Seagate's Ripple investment high on the list of reasons to buy the stock, but it's a different story with the underlying drivers behind the company's good quarterly update earlier this year. Demand is increasing for hard-disk drives (HDDs) from data centers looking for cost-effective storage. Seagate continues to move toward making higher-capacity storage -- exactly what data centers need.At the same time, Seagate is also positioning itself to be more competitive in the solid-state drive (SSD) market. The company partnered with Toshiba in October 2017 in a long-term supply agreement for NAND flash memory chips that can be used in SSDs, HDDs, or hybrid solutions.Favorite of the groupAll three of these high-yielding stocks should perform well over the long run. My favorite, though, is Iron Mountain. I like the company's near-monopoly status in its market. I also think its move into data centers will pay off. And who wouldn't like that mouthwatering dividend?In addition, the current economic boom will subside sooner or later. Iron Mountain's business should allow the company to ride out a recession better than most, since companies will require records and data storage regardless of how the economy is performing. Overall, this stock appears to be a great pick for income-seeking investors."
Forget Cryptocurrencies: You're Better Off Buying These 3 Stocks,"Feb 1, 2018 at 7:03AM","Cryptocurrencies are exciting. They're also extremely volatile, and there's a good possibility you could lose your entire investment if you buy bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, or any other cryptocurrency. In short, buying cryptocurrencies is a form of speculation, not investing.Instead, consider investing in companies that could potentially benefit from the surging cryptocurrency market but will also do just fine if cryptocurrencies start to fizzle out. Here's why our contributors think Square (NYSE:SQ), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) are smarter ways to go.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The right way to invest in cryptocurrenciesMatt Frankel (Square): The best way that investors -- not speculators -- can get a piece of the growth in the cryptocurrency market isn't to buy bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrencies. It's also not a good idea to invest in a company that adds ""blockchain"" to its name, or to put your money into an initial coin offering.Instead, the smartest way to play the cryptocurrency trend is to invest in a company with a thriving, growing business that could also benefit if cryptocurrencies start to become more mainstream. Payment-processing company Square is my favorite example.Companies are adopting Square's small-business payment solutions all over the U.S. and the other four countries Square currently operates in. Over the past year alone, the gross payment volume processed through Square's platform grew by 31%. And since two-thirds of businesses around the world still don't accept card payments, there's tremendous opportunity for growth. Square Capital, the company's business loan service; Caviar, its food delivery platform; and the Square Cash payments app are all growing strongly as well, just to name a few of the company's businesses.In November, Square announced that it was testing support for bitcoin buying and selling through its Square Cash app. While this is a small-scale test at this point, it could prove to be a serious revenue driver for Square if it's successful -- especially if it means that Square's payment-processing platform eventually accepts bitcoin (and maybe even other cryptocurrency) payments.A royalty on internet trafficJordan Wathen (Alphabet): It's hard to imagine a world where internet search becomes less important, and less profitable, in the future than it is today. Alphabet's best and most valuable asset is its search engine, Google, and display advertising properties such as YouTube should grow revenue and profit at a double-digit clip for a long time to come.The core search and advertising business has meaningful growth drivers in the form of click growth, rising prices in emerging markets, and improved monetization within particularly valuable corners of e-commerce, including travel, where Google is already soaking up billions of dollars in annual advertising revenue. The biggest risk to Alphabet is the rise of advertising blockers, in my view. Google will soon implement a native ad blocker in its browser, Chrome, which I see as a smart defensive move. This update will go live on Feb. 15, and will block ads that fail to meet standards for usability.I don't know what to make of Alphabet's interesting, though money-losing, ""other bets"" -- long-shot investments that could become the next star like YouTube, or the next flop like Google Reader. But I think these could continue to be perpetual money losers even as Alphabet still generates market-beating returns. Though it's far from optically cheap -- shares trade at about 35 times trailing earnings after backing out its excess cash -- a long runway for growth makes its multiple more digestible for investors who take the long view. Save this idea for your portfolioDan Caplinger (Seagate Technology): The primary problem I have with investing in cryptocurrency is that I have no confidence in the intrinsic value of the tokens themselves. What I'd like to own are companies that are profiting from the rise in cryptocurrencies, but most of them aren't publicly traded. Seagate, however, has a link to the cryptocurrency world that makes it an intriguing play on the trend.Seagate was one of the initial investors in the company now known as Ripple Labs, which has created 100 billion tokens of what it calls ripple. Even though the cryptocurrency has fallen dramatically from its highs, ripple still sold for more than $1 as of Jan. 30. It's uncertain what stake Seagate has in ripple or Ripple Labs, but the position ties its fortunes to those of cryptocurrencies to some extent.Meanwhile, Seagate also has its core data storage business to drive performance. Even though traditional hard disk drives are arguably on their way out, the need for high-volume data center storage has helped Seagate make maximum use of its full range of technology. More advanced solid-state drives help provide greater speed when necessary, and Seagate is aiming squarely at that market as well. In all, Seagate is a diversified play on several promising tech trends.Bitcoin is overhyped: 10 better buys for you nowWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2 Cheap Dividend Stocks You Shouldn’t Miss,"Jan 29, 2018 at 6:06PM","The technology sector's average dividend yield is just 1.2% because companies in this sector try to stay ahead of the curve by reinvesting earnings into their business, with top-line growth and market share gains as their top priorities. In fact, industrial goods and healthcare are the only two sectors that rank below tech when it comes to yields. But there are certain names in the tech sector that could be an income investor's dream.In this article, I look at two such tech stocks -- Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) -- that carry nice dividend yields. What's more, both companies are cheaply valued, so investors don't have to pay outrageously to take advantage of their fat yields.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Cisco SystemsCisco has been paying a dividend since 2011, and has raised it every year.CSCO DIVIDEND DATA BY YCHARTSThe stock currently sports a forward annual dividend yield of 2.8%, significantly higher than the technology sector's average. More important, its payout ratio of 52.5% isn't too aggressive, either, so it shouldn't have much difficulty in sustaining its dividend.But investors need to know that Cisco is in the midst of a transformation. The company has realized that it needs to change its business model from selling devices such as routers and switches to software-centric offerings, so it has become more flexible and has started software sales independent of the underlying hardware.This transformation hasn't been without pain for Cisco. In the last reported quarter, its net income grew 3% year over year to $2.4 billion even though revenue dropped 2%. But the outlook for the second quarter calls for year-over-year revenue growth between 1% and 3%, indicating that things are gradually getting better.The good news is that Cisco's switch toward software is gaining traction. It got 32% of its revenue from recurring sources in the last-reported quarter, an increase of 3 percentage points from the year-ago period. A higher proportion of recurring revenue bodes well for Cisco, because its spending on customer acquisition and servicing will ideally drop. This is probably why the company's earnings increased despite a shaky top-line performance last quarter.More important, the contribution of recurring revenue sources to Cisco's top line will keep increasing given the growth in its deferred revenue. Last quarter, the company's deferred revenue related to software and subscription sales increased 37%, outpacing the 10% jump in overall deferred revenue.Analysts expect Cisco's bottom line to grow at almost 9% a year over the next five years, which is substantially higher than the 4.8% growth it has clocked over the last five. So Cisco looks well positioned to keep raising its dividend in the long run as the shift in its business model will accelerate bottom-line growth, making the stock an enticing pick considering its valuation.Cisco trades at 21.5 times last year's earnings, significantly below the 34.9 industry average. The stock's forward earnings multiple of 16.8 makes it even more attractive, since it points toward a stronger earnings performance going forward.In all, Cisco's business is moving in the right direction, making it a top pick for investors looking for a cheap dividend-paying stock.Seagate TechnologyStorage specialist Seagate Technology sports a really fat dividend yield of 4.9%. It has been paying a dividend for 15 years now, though its last dividend hike came almost three years ago. Still, investors shouldn't be complaining, because the size of the company's dividend is quite substantial.Its payout ratio of 58.3% looks very aggressive when compared to rival Western Digital, which has a 16.4% payout ratio. But Seagate seems quite capable of maintaining its impressive payout, or even increasing it down the line because of its focus on earnings growth.STX NET INCOME (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTSSeagate's net income rose 8.3% year over year during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, with its gross margin coming in at 28%. The company's gross margin during the second quarter will rise to 30%, while its operating expenses will drop in the ballpark of 3% to 5% sequentially. So Seagate looks set for stronger earnings growth once again, a trend that it should be able to maintain for a long time.Seagate is benefiting from the broader industry trend of an increase in the average storage capacity of drives, which is helping it push down costs. The company shipped 88 exabytes of hard-disk drive (HDD) capacity during the recently concluded second quarter, a jump of 29% from the prior-year period.But at the same time, HDD unit shipments were almost flat year over year at 40 million units, pushing the average capacity per HDD to 2.2 terabytes from 1.7 terabytes in the year-ago period. So Seagate is packing more memory into each hard drive to meet the rising enterprise demand, improving its cost profile.This is because the cost per gigabyte of a drive declines as the size of the HDD increases, raising Seagate's profitability in the process. Data storage demand is expected to rise fourfold by 2025, so the average capacity of an HDD should keep rising. In fact, the possibility of a 100 terabyte HDD by 2025 cannot be ruled out as storage density increases.Seagate, therefore, looks primed for strong earnings growth, with analysts estimating a 15% compound annual earnings growth for the next five years as compared to an annual earnings erosion of 13% during the last half-decade.Finally, Seagate is cheaply valued. It trades at 11.9 times forward earnings, compared to the 25.5 industry average, making it an ideal pick for investors looking for a combination of earnings growth and a fat dividend at an attractive price.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is a Ripple IPO Coming in 2018?,"Jan 14, 2018 at 8:02AM","Cryptocurrencies have been on fire lately, and the gains have gone far beyond bitcoin (BTC-USD). Many people are just hearing about competing entrants in the crypto space, and some of their gains have put bitcoin's rise in 2017 to shame.One of the best performers last year was ripple (XRP-USD), a rival cryptocurrency that quickly climbed to become the No. 2 player in the market by total value of outstanding tokens before falling back at the beginning of 2018. Unlike bitcoin, ripple has a company behind it -- Ripple Labs -- that has been instrumental in developing the open-source payment network. Many investors who are optimistic about blockchain technology but dubious about trading in cryptocurrencies themselves want opportunities to invest in the companies behind tokens like ripple, and that's drawing speculation that Ripple Labs could file to go public in the coming year. Let's take a closer look at Ripple Labs and whether it would make a good IPO candidate in 2018.IMAGE SOURCE: RIPPLE.Insiders might want a Ripple IPORipple Labs has attracted high-profile interest during its short history. Just after its founding in 2012, Ripple Labs did a private placement, raising more than $2 million in a seed round of funding in April 2013. Influential investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and a fund managed by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund participated in the seed round.Subsequent funding rounds brought in even more investors. Later in 2013, Google Ventures and IDG Capital Partners were among those investing undisclosed figures in Ripple Labs. By late 2014, Ripple Labs had announced a $32 million deal for further funding, issuing common stock to existing investors and putting a $100 million valuation on the business. The deal closed in late 2015, with 28 investors eventually participating, including CME Group (NASDAQ:CME), Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), and a fund associated with Banco Santander's (NYSE:SAN) U.K. unit.The most recent round in 2016 brought in $55 million. CME, Seagate, Santander, and others participated in the series B round, with Ripple Labs saying it would use proceeds to accelerate customer growth, pursue strategic partnerships, and expand its team internationally.The current stakes of these parties is unknown publicly. However, any venture capitalist is always looking for ideal times to realize profits. Going public is a time-honored way for early investors to cash out, although the trend in recent years has been to delay IPOs longer into the development of an up-and-coming company to maximize the amount of pre-IPO gains for ground-floor investors.What Ripple Labs management thinksRipple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse has addressed the question of a Ripple IPO head-on. When asked in September 2017 on CNBC  what the pros and cons of a Ripple IPO would be, Garlinghouse said, ""I want to make sure we have the right managerial maturity, infrastructure, and ability to forecast properly. ... At some point it will make sense. Just not today.""How much more progress would be necessary before Garlinghouse and other executives might be more comfortable with an IPO isn't entirely clear. Yet one thing that potential IPO investors would want to understand more fully is the business case for Ripple Labs as an entity separate from the success of ripple (XRP-USD). Currently, many cryptocurrency investors assign just about all of the value of Ripple Labs to the ripple that it controls. To justify an IPO, Ripple Labs would need to demonstrate its ability to profit from its work beyond simply participating in any price gains of ripple itself.Why wouldn't Ripple do an IPO?Apart from the potential desire of existing investors to retain their full stake in Ripple Labs, there's at least one ongoing issue that could delay an IPO. The company is currently embroiled in litigation with a consortium of banks known as R3. According to court filings, R3 and Ripple Labs made a deal that involved granting R3 an option to purchase 5 billion ripple (XRP-USD) at a price of less than $0.01 per XRP. Given the appreciation in the value of the cryptocurrency, that option could be worth well in excess of $10 billion.Both R3 and Ripple Labs are vigorously fighting a back-and-forth legal battle. Given that the option covers 5% of the total potential supply of ripple in existence, the uncertainty of the outcome could lead company officials to feel uncomfortable with any plans to go public until the two litigants can reach a final resolution.Keep your eye on rippleRipple's low price and visible use case make it an attractive cryptocurrency right now. Yet for Ripple Labs, looking for an IPO to cash in on the popularity of ripple in 2018 seems a bit premature. With so much potential for further development, it's likely that Ripple Labs' investors will hold off on any moves toward going public until ripple becomes a much better-known player not just among crypto followers but in the mainstream investment community as a whole.Bitcoin is overhyped: 10 better buys for you nowWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 High-Yield Tech Stocks,"Jan 15, 2018 at 10:49AM","The tech industry is filled with companies that are making huge bets on new endeavors like artificial intelligence, driverless cars, augmented reality, and other attention-grabbing ideas. Income investors looking for stability can sometimes be put off by tech companies and their pursuit of the next big thing. But the technology sector actually has a lot to offer dividend investors, and the companies' yields can often be very generous. Cases in point are Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN), Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). These companies are firmly established in the technology sector, and each is paying their shareholders well, so let's take a closer look at each company.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.A gadget-maker that's bucked expectationsJeremy Bowman (Garmin): Finding high-yield tech stocks is no easy business as the industry tends be filled with riskier high-growth plays, but one stock that fits the bill is Garmin. The gadget-maker, best known for its GPS and fitness-tracking devices, was written off by the investing world once the iPhone boomed as consumers no longer needed stand-alone GPS devices, but the company has successfully pivoted to more technical and specific niches targeting areas like golf, fishing, and aviation.The navigation specialist has also been a solid dividend payer along the way and now offers a yield of 3.4%. Shares have nearly doubled over the last two years, and the stock gained 23% last year on better-than-expected sales and profit growth. In the most recent quarter, total revenue increased only 3% as the auto segment continues to shrink and fitness has been challenged lately. However, 31% sales growth in the outdoor category propelled gross margin up 220 basis points, leading to an 18% increase in GAAP EPS to $0.78.Garmin has a solid streak of topping analyst estimates as it's beaten the experts' view in each of the last eight quarters.  Considering the company just raised its full-year guidance in November, it could be set for significant growth next year, though analysts are only expecting a modest uptick in EPS around 3%.Dividend investors should note that Garmin hasn't raised its quarterly payout since 2015, but that could change if profits continue to grow. The company's payout ratio is 70% based on this year's adjusted expected earnings, so a modest increase in the dividend could be in investors' future.Boost your savings with this memory maker Todd Campbell (Seagate): Buying high dividend yielding stocks often means accepting trade-offs, and that's true of Seagate, too. Its sales have slipped as solid-state drive (SSD) memory has won market share away from hard-disk drives (HDD). Nevertheless, I think it's a good time to buy Seagate shares and pocket its 5.4% dividend yield. Here's why.As memory demand shifts from consumer electronics, such as PCs, to enterprises, data-intense trends like artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things will cause memory demand to climb tenfold between 2016 and 2025, according to IDC. SSD's will benefit most, but high-capacity hard drives won't be left totally out in the cold, and that fact may be under-appreciated by Wall Street. Preliminary Q2 2018 sales of $2.9 billion outpaced analyst expectations of $2.75 billion, and Q1 2018 revenue of $2.63 billion was $110 million better than expected.Seagate's cost-cutting may similarly be underappreciated. Seagate hasn't revealed official non-GAAP EPS for Q2 2018 yet, but it did say that non-GAAP operating expenses were $390 million in fiscal Q2 2018, down from $408 million in Q1 2018. Job cuts announced in December will save it another $65 million per year, too.One knock against Seagate is that it's returning more money to investors than it's generating in cash. In Q1 2018, operating cash flow was $237 million, yet it spent $184 million on dividends and $166 million on share buybacks.We'll need to keep an eye on that, but I'm not too worried yet because sales are falling more slowly, and cost cuts are happening more quickly than expected. Plus, the company has $2.6 billion in cash and equivalents as a backstop, and it's investing in SSDs, which could help offset some HDD weakness in the future.Admittedly, SSDs are a small part of its business, but sales are growing quickly. Non-HDD sales were $242 million in fiscal Q1, up 30% quarter over quarter and 17% year over year. Its decision last fall to join a consortium to acquire Toshiba Memory Corporation has secured it a long-term supply of NAND memory at favorable costs that strengthen its SSD position, too.Overall, I don't think Seagate's future is as dim as others, and if I'm right, then buying it for its high dividend yield could be smart.A tech giant planning for the futureChris Neiger (Cisco): There's a lot to like about Cisco for income investors. The company has a forward dividend yield of 2.91%, a reasonable payout ratio of 58.5%, and the company has increased its dividend for the past six consecutive years.Cisco is in the middle of technological upheaval at the moment, as the company moves away from its longtime business of selling router and switches hardware and moves to more recurring revenue from software. That's resulted in some revenue declines -- most recently a 2% year-over-year drop in the fiscal first quarter of 2018, but there's still lots of potential for the company.The tech giant made eight acquisitions last year in order to boost its recurring cloud services revenue, and its most recent acquisition of Broadsoft adds more software services that Cisco didn't have previously.Recurring revenue accounted for 32% of of the company's sales in the last quarter -- an increase of 3 percentage points from a year ago -- and management is confident that there will be more growth in the current second quarter as well.""So I'd say, overall, the overall strategy, what we've been executing and talking about for the last couple of years here is we've been making progress, and all of this is benefiting us in the outlook,"" Cisco CFO Kelly Kramer said on the latest earnings call.It's also worth pointing out that as the company has transitioned to new cloud-based software offerings, Cisco still managed to outpace analysts' consensus estimates for both sales and earnings in the first quarter. It'll likely be a slow transition to more cloud services for Cisco, but investors should take note of the company's progress to date and know that the company is committed to this growing market. Don't expect stellar growth from the slow-moving tech giant, but the company's stability should be enough to keep its high yield in tact for investors.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Top Tech Dividend Stocks to Buy Now,"Feb 9, 2018 at 2:29PM","If you're on the hunt for stocks that offer hefty dividends and market-beating growth prospects, there's no better place to look than the technology sector. That's a relatively recent development and one that might surprise some investors.Dividend-paying tech stocks used to be something of a rarity, but there's no longer a shortage of companies in the sector that offer sizable payouts. In many cases, these companies have turned to dividends in order to compensate for slowing growth or difficult transitional periods. However, some of these businesses will be able to bounce back and better tap in to tech sector momentum -- paving the way for a combination of capital appreciation and income generation. With that in mind, here's why IBM (NYSE:IBM), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) are top dividend plays in the tech sector. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.IBMIBM stock has lagged the broader market over the last five years as declining demand for its legacy hardware and services has weighed on the business, but there are signs that the company's turnaround is making progress.Big Blue's most recent earnings report snapped a 22-quarter streak of consecutive revenue declines, delivering currency-adjusted sales growth of 1%. That's far from the roaring momentum growth many investors are looking for, but it could signal an important turning point for the company.IBM's strategic imperatives segment, which includes growth business like cognitive computing, security, and mobile, saw its revenues increase 14% to reach 46% of total sales last quarter. The December-ended fiscal year also saw the company record $17 billion in cloud revenue (up 24% year over year) and notch an 18% increase in as-a-service revenue to reach $10.3 billion. That's evidence of solid demand for cloud services that should continue aiding the company's transformation effort. The turnaround remains an ongoing process, but patient investors have an opportunity to buy IBM's long-term potential at a discount and enjoy sizable returned income along the way.Shares yield roughly 3.8% at current prices, and investors can be reasonably certain that the company's payout will continue to increase with time. IBM has raised its disbursement annually for 22 years running, and with the cost of distributing its payout representing just 42% of trailing free cash flow (FCF), there's room to boost its payout even if the business enters a slow cycle.Big Blue is also in the middle of a share repurchasing initiative. Between its dividend and buybacks, the company returned roughly three quarters of its $13 billion 2017 free cash flow to shareholders, and it will likely continue adding to its commendable history of returning value to investors.Priced at roughly 11 times forward earnings estimates, IBM stands out as a worthwhile play for long-term investors looking for dividend-paying stocks in the tech sector. Cisco SystemsEven after gaining roughly 30% over the last year, Cisco stock remains an attractive investment for those seeking income-generating tech stocks. Shares are valued at a reasonable 17 times forward earnings, offer a dividend yield of roughly 2.8%, and have long-term upside as the networking giant hones its business to better meet the demands of a shifting industry landscape. Like IBM, Cisco is looking to move away from a hardware-dependent business model in favor of a software-focused strategy. Prioritizing subscription revenues has meant sales declines in recent quarters, but the upside is that the transition will produce dependable recurring revenue down the line. As of the company's October-ended quarter, 32% of the sales were generated from subscriptions -- up from 29% in the prior-year period, and deferred revenue actually increased 10%.As the number of networked devices continues to expand thanks to connected cars, smart cities, and other Internet of Things technologies, Cisco's expertise in the hardware and software sides of connectivity could open up avenues to sustainable growth.There's already some evidence of momentum on this front, with revenue for its security business increasing 8% year over year last quarter, and deferred revenues for the category up 42% compared to the prior-year period. Security software still makes up a small portion of Cisco's sales (roughly 5% in the last quarter), but there are indications that it could solidify as a sales driver that also increases the appeal of the company's switch and router hardware. Returning to the income side of things, Cisco is a cash-flow machine -- with roughly $13.4 billion in free cash flow over the trailing-12-month period, and the cost of distributing its current dividend coming in at just 45% of FCF over the stretch. Cisco has a very solid balance sheet as well, with somewhere in the neighborhood of $36 billion in cash and short-term assets net of debt.Based on management's comments, the company will likely use recent cuts to the U.S. corporate and repatriation tax rates as an occasion to deliver substantial dividend growth and make acquisitions that accelerate its push into software -- developments that could have a big long-term payoff for shareholders.    IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Seagate TechnologySeagate Technology is a company at the center of conflicting product trends in the digital storage industry. As more file storage migrates to the cloud, conventional wisdom has held that Seagate's business will be negatively impacted. Until relatively recently, that's translated to soggy stock performance, and shares are still down roughly 13% over the last three years, but the company appears to be turning a corner. To be sure, the rise of cloud storage will have a negative impact on the need for storage in consumer devices like laptops and tablets, but that's only part of the picture.The good news is that Seagate still sees a big opportunity in providing storage for the data centers at the heart of the cloud computing and storage revolutions, and a move away from smaller-capacity hard drives is creating sales and margin momentum. The company is also finding success in reducing business costs, with operating expenses down 15% year over year last quarter to reach $390 million. Looking ahead, management expects to have reduced non-GAAP quarterly operating expenses to $375 million by the end of its current fiscal year.Even after climbing more than 50% over the last six months, Seagate is reasonably priced at roughly 10.5 times forward earnings estimates and sports a 4.9% dividend yield. The company hasn't raised its dividend since 2015, and investors probably shouldn't expect a payout increase in the near future based on management's comments in the company's most recent earnings call. That said, the stock already offers a hefty yield, and the company seems to be in good shape to maintain its current payout levels -- with the cost of distributing its current dividend coming in at just 55% of trailing free cash flow and momentum that suggests its payout is in little danger of being cut. The December-ended quarter saw the company's FCF climb 38% year over year, and an increasingly favorable outlook for sales and margins paints an appealing picture for future earnings and dividend growth. 10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What to Expect From Marvell Technology’s Q4 Earnings,"Mar 6, 2018 at 11:01PM","Marvell Technology Group's (NASDAQ:MRVL) fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 report on March 8 is going to be closely watched by investors, who have been betting on a Marvell turnaround for over two years now.MRVL DATA BY YCHARTS. TTM = TRAILING 12 MONTHS.Here's what to look for.IMAGE SOURCE: MARVELL TECHNOLOGY GROUP. Growth will get back on trackMarvell is expected to have earned $0.31 per share on revenue of $611 million during the fourth quarter, which compares favorably to the previous year's earnings of $0.22 per share and revenue of $571.4 million. The consensus estimates are in line with the midpoint of the company's own guidance.If Marvell hits the midpoint of its top-line guidance, its revenue will increase close to 7% year over year. By comparison, the company's top line dropped 5% year over year during the same period last year. A turnaround in Marvell's fortunes will be driven by improving traction in the storage and networking businesses, which have impressive catalysts.For instance, the growing demand for solid-state drives (SSDs) is crucial in driving the storage business. The company's storage-related revenue increased 10% during the first nine months of the fiscal year thanks to a huge ramp-up in SSD demand. Marvell management estimates that SSDs could contribute as much as 30% of its storage sales this year -- good from a long-term perspective given the substantial growth available here.Meanwhile, Marvell's recently launched automotive connectivity products are positively impacting its business. During the third quarter, the company's connectivity revenue had increased an impressive 19% year over year. Automotive could have played a key role in this jump as the company was already in negotiations with potential customers to deploy its connectivity products.So, Marvell looks all set to release a strong quarterly report and a sunny outlook.Looking at the long runI have already mentioned that automotive and SSDs are the two key catalysts boosting Marvell's top line, and both these areas should gain more traction in the coming quarters. For instance, the chipmaker is engaged with leading Tier 1 automotive component suppliers to build next-generation high-speed networks to enable secure connectivity in self-driving cars.Though the initial revenue ramp-up from the automotive segment is going to be modest, according to management, it should prove to be a big growth driver in the long run. Market researcher TechNavio estimates that the global automotive Ethernet market will expand at an annual pace of 42% for the next four years. Marvell is going after this opportunity with a secure automotive gigabit Ethernet switch that it claims to be an industry first.Meanwhile, the impending acquisition of Cavium, expected to close soon, will increase Marvell's addressable market by $8 billion by giving it access to the data-center switching space. So the growth of the chipmaker's networking and connectivity business segments, which together account for 41% of total revenue, looks secure for the long run.The storage business will be driven by the growing proliferation of SSDs. Marvell makes storage controllers that are used in solid-state drives, and it supplies these chips to both Western Digital and Seagate. The SSD market is expected to grow 14.7% annually over the next five years, driven by its growing adoption in cloud computing and data centers. Marvell looks well placed to tap this growth thanks to its relationship with Western Digital and Seagate.The bottom line is that Marvell Technology is going after fast-growing areas to drive growth. Analysts believe that the catalysts discussed above could boost its earnings at an annual rate of over 22% for the next five years, and a strong set of results this week should confirm that it is capable of achieving the same.10 stocks we like better than Marvell Technology GroupWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 High-Yield Tech Stocks,"Feb 6, 2018 at 4:08PM","As many people search for the best high-yield dividend stocks, the fast-changing tech sector is often the last place they look. But make no mistake; some of the market's most promising dividend stocks hail from the world of technology.So we asked three top Motley Fool investors to each pick a high-yield tech stock that they believe investors would be wise to consider today. Read on to learn why they chose Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX).IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGESA juicy yield from a telecom giantSteve Symington (Verizon Communications): Things were looking up for Verizon shareholders after the company's latest quarterly results exceeded expectations two weeks ago. But the telecommunications leader has all but given up those gains as the broader market pulled back hard over the past few days.However -- keeping in mind Verizon has increased its dividend for 11 straight years -- patient investors can take solace knowing that its dividend yields around 4.72% annually as of this writing. And its underlying wireless business remains strong, with the company adding an impressive 1.2 million retail postpaid wireless subscribers last quarter. Verizon also achieved healthy postpaid phone churn of 0.77%, demonstrating exceptional customer loyalty and marking its 11th straight period of keeping the metric under 0.9%.What's more, that loyalty should be cemented with Verizon's planned commercial launch of its next-generation 5G network in 2018. Though to be fair, investors should watch closely to ensure the Trump administration doesn't follow through with potentially disastrous plans to nationalize the wireless industry.Meanwhile, Verizon is expected to benefit greatly from recent U.S. tax reform initiatives, with management estimating the changes will result in a net increase to cash flow from operations in the range of $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion this year. Add to that the potential for incremental growth from Verizon's Oath media subsidiary -- which generated revenue of $2.2 billion last quarter from dozens of leading media brands including the likes of Yahoo, AOL, TechCrunch, HuffPost, and Engadget, to name only a few -- and Verizon could be a fantastic bet for yield-hungry shareholders looking for a place to put their money to work.A return to growthTim Green (Cisco Systems): Shares of enterprise networking hardware vendor Cisco Systems shot up nearly 27% last year, outpacing the broader market. After two years of slumping quarterly revenue, the company forecast a return to growth in its fiscal second quarter, results for which will be announced on Feb. 14. Cisco's ongoing shift to subscriptions and recurring revenue, while painful in the short term as revenue is pushed out into the future, is finally starting to pay off.This rise in the stock price has pushed down Cisco's dividend yield, but the stock still offers a yield far higher than the S&P 500. Based on Cisco's latest quarterly dividend payment, shares of the tech company sport a yield of about 2.8%. And Cisco will likely announce a dividend increase in the next month or so, if history is any indication.Cisco's dividend currently eats up a little less than $6 billion annually, less than half the company's annual free cash flow. Cisco will likely provide an update when it reports its results in February about how the tax bill will affect the company's results. A lower corporate tax rate coupled with the repatriation of foreign cash could lead Cisco to accelerate its dividend growth.Cisco stock trades for less than 16 times its fiscal 2017 free cash flow. That ratio drops further if you back out the net cash on Cisco's balance sheet. If you want a high-yield tech stock trading for a reasonable price, look no further than Cisco.Imperfect, inexpensive, with incredible dividendsAnders Bylund (Seagate Technology): The hard-drive manufacturer certainly qualifies as a high-yielder, thanks to a beefy 4.9% dividend yield at current share prices. That torrential cash spigot becomes even more impressive when you consider that Seagate's stock gained 40% in January and 54% over the last six months -- if you bought shares in early August, you'd be looking at an effective yield of 7.5% right now.The company is not an out-and-out Dividend Aristocrat, but rather an opportunistic booster of dividend check amounts. The quarterly payout has been stuck at $0.63 per share since the fall of 2015, freezing Seagate's dividend and freeing management to put its surplus cash to other use. That being said, the annual payout has increased by 250% over the last seven years.STX DIVIDEND DATA BY YCHARTSNone of this matters if the company is going down the drain, of course. I have been a skeptic because Seagate is lagging behind nemesis Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) in terms of addressing the rise of solid-state storage devices -- high-speed tools built around memory chips rather than spinning magnetic discs. The company is winning me over in two ways:Traditional hard drives seem to have a long-term ticket to ride the enterprise sector. Seagate's sales to large corporations with enormous data storage needs are booming, thanks to the lower cost of large disc-based drives. That trend might even have legs after all.Seagate recently signed a long-term supply deal with memory chip maker Toshiba (NASDAQOTH:TOSBF), showing that management is considering new ideas.So you're taking on some risk with this investment, but Seagate's generous dividends just might be worth it.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Obsidian Energy Ltd’s Stock Is Rising Today,"Apr 2, 2018 at 1:46PM","What happenedShares of Obsidian Energy Ltd (NYSE:OBE) are bucking Monday's market sell-off, rising as much as 15% by mid-morning, and still up about 7% by 12:30 p.m. EDT even as the market's rout accelerated. Fueling this rally was the announcement of several actions designed to unlock shareholder value. So whatObsidian Energy announced that it has launched a sales process for its Viking assets in Alberta, Canada and that it is in discussion with China Investment Corporation about the sale of the company's jointly owned Peace River assets.

It's also in response to a public spat with one of the company's largest shareholders, FrontFour Capital, which has demanded the company sell noncore assets and ""aggressively shift the drilling program to the higher return Cardium.""In addition to these asset sales, Obsidian said it was ""actively reviewing industry consolidation opportunities,"" which could see it potentially buy additional assets in the Cardium.

Further, it could potentially give the company the cash to accelerate drilling in its crown jewel Cardium assets as well as buy back its depressed stock, which is down 40% over the past year despite higher oil prices and its turnaround efforts. That buyback could be the key to getting Obsidian's stock moving in the right direction given how similar programs from rivals have fueled their recent outperformance."
"Why Square, Groupon, and Fossil Group Jumped Today","Jan 19, 2018 at 4:30PM","The stock market finished the week well on Friday, with broad benchmarks posting modest rises even as the Dow fought to stay in positive territory. Earnings dominated the news today, with the favorable impacts of tax reform continuing to lift many stocks across various industries. Yet some are still nervous about the prospects for a government shutdown that could begin at midnight tonight, and those concerns helped send Treasury yields to three-year highs and the U.S. dollar near three-year lows. Still, some individual companies' shares saw strong advances, and Square (NYSE:SQ), Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), and Fossil Group (NASDAQ:FOSL) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.It's hip to be SquareShares of Square gained close to 6% after analysts made favorable comparisons between the payments specialist and some of the largest technology companies in the industry. Analysts at Nomura Instinet repeated its buy recommendation on Square and gave a $64 price target on the stock, arguing that the company is evolving beyond its current focus on small-business payments toward adding payroll and human resources services. That could help Square shift toward bigger enterprises and open up much greater market opportunities. The stock has already been on fire, but investors clearly believe that Square has the potential to transform into a much faster grower in 2018 and beyond.IMAGE SOURCE: SQUARE.Groupon keeps dealingGroupon stock climbed 9% as it picked up momentum from an upgrade at Goldman Sachs earlier in the week. On Wednesday, Goldman upgraded Groupon from sell to neutral, boosting its price target by 15% to $5.40 per share and arguing that cost-containment measures combined with growing gross profits make the daily deals specialist a fair value at current levels. If the company's Groupon+ initiative can gain traction, then a revival of its formerly successful business model could help justify the sizable bounce the stock has already experienced.Is Fossil looking for buyers?Finally, shares of Fossil Group picked up 10%. Some market participants believe that the ailing watchmaker's upward move today stemmed from renewed hopes that it might attract a buyout bid from an acquiring company interested in the upscale watch and accessories business. Fossil looks cheap after a huge decline in 2017, and expectations are low for the just-ended holiday season. Still, with the challenge of navigating the fast-changing wearable technology business while maintaining its reputation in the fashion world, Fossil has a tough line to walk toward a full recovery."
Why Corning's Stock Soared More Than 30% in 2017,"Jan 16, 2018 at 7:37AM","What happenedShares of glassmaker Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) rose 31.8% in 2017, handily outpacing the S&P 500. That was on top of a 32.8% gain in 2016. And with additional gains so far in 2018, the company's stock is up 89.6% since the beginning of 2016, just over two years ago.Luckily, this trend seems likely to continue into the new year.So whatCorning's business consists of its bread-and-butter display technologies segment, and a bunch of smaller business units. Display technologies, which manufactures the glass for LCD screens of all sorts -- but primarily TVs -- is responsible for 30% of Corning's sales and 60% of its profits. Unfortunately, display glass prices have been falling for several years, which has caused Corning's bottom line a lot of problems. Fortunately -- and one of the reasons the company did so well in the first nine months of 2017 -- those price drops have gotten smaller and smaller, which has helped Corning keep profit shrinkage to a minimum. That allowed some of Corning's smaller units to pick up the slack, which they did in a big way last year.CORNING'S RELIANCE ON TV DISPLAY GLASS HAS WANED AS MARKETS FOR ITS OTHER PRODUCTS HAVE GROWN. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Of particular interest to investors should be the company's specialty materials segment, which manufactures the flexible and shatter-resistant Gorilla Glass. Gorilla Glass is primarily used in smartphone screens, including every Apple iPhone and iPad ever manufactured. Corning's fifth-generation Gorilla Glass 5, which it rolled out in 2016, is now being used in products by virtually every major smartphone manufacturer, including Samsung's Galaxy S8. That widespread usage helped increase the segment's profits 66% year over year for the first nine months of 2017.And speaking of big profit increases, net income was up 60.1% year over year in the company's second-largest division, optical communications. The segment primarily manufactures optical fibers -- a lot of them. In 2017 it produced its one billionth kilometer of optical fiber, and also benefited from a commitment by Verizon to buy at least $1.05 billion of optical fiber and associated products from Corning for its network. Meanwhile, the company is continuing to develop new applications for its glass in automobiles, pharmaceutical packaging, and more.Now whatCorning's new product lines -- and its successful upgrades to existing ones -- outside of its display technologies segment are helping to reduce its overall reliance on TV sales and display glass prices. And with the decline in display glass prices continuing to slow -- at least for now -- Corning should continue to reap the benefits of its other units' outperformance. With big names like Apple, Samsung, and Verizon among its customers, there's good reason to believe that Corning will continue to outperform in 2018.10 stocks we like better than CorningWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why TAL Education Group Stock Jumped 16% in February,"Mar 15, 2018 at 4:58PM","What happenedShares of Chinese after-school tutoring services specialist TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL) jumped 15.9% last month, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence .  So whatTAL stock continued in its recent upward, if volatile, trend during the month of February after the company released another impressive earnings report on Jan. 25. In TAL's fiscal third quarter of 2018, which ended Nov. 30, 2017, revenue soared 66.3% to $433.3 million versus the comparable prior-year quarter. Operating income more than doubled to $44.6 million. While selling and marketing costs rose roughly in line with revenue, the company's general and administrative expenses expanded at a slightly slower rate, rising by nearly 48% during the third quarter. Thus, TAL was able to achieve a bit of operating leverage, which resulted in the higher operating income.TAL's stellar results rested on continued expansion of its student base. The tutoring service reported total enrollments of 1.5 million at quarter-end, representing an increase of 85% over the comparable prior-year quarter. In the organization's earnings release, CFO Rong Luo commented that TAL intends to keep its student base engaged by investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and educational technology (EDTECH). Investments in these areas should benefit TAL in the coming quarters as it seeks to draw revenue from higher online delivery of services versus prior years.The swift expansion in students (and consequently revenue) that TAL has enjoyed is beginning to manifest itself through increased cash flow. In the first nine months of its fiscal year, TAL's cash and investment balances swelled from $700 million to over $1.3 billion. A strong balance sheet will likely come in handy once organic growth inevitably slows, should the company seek to maintain its revenue expansion through bolt-on acquisitions.Now whatIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.As it closes out fiscal 2018, TAL's management projects a fourth-quarter revenue increase of 50% to 52%, which translates to revenue of between $474.5 million and $480.8 million. While TAL obviously remains in high gear, investors should exercise a measure of caution -- shares have rocketed over 150% during the last 12 months.10 stocks we like better than TAL Education GroupWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Let me now turn the call over to Thomas Morton, Switch's president. Thomas?Thomas Morton -- President and General CounselThank you, Irmina. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Needless to say, 2017 was a big year for Switch. We had record growth, announced the fourth PRIME in Atlanta, Georgia, and successfully completed the year's third largest technology IPO in October. Since the last earnings call in November, we had a chance to speak to and meet with many of you. We look forward to continuing the dialogue and seeing you at upcoming conferences.I would like to start today with a summary of our operating results in 2017, followed by a review of our accomplishments, and finally, setting out some of our strategic initiatives in recent months. I will then turn the call over to Gabe Nacht, our CFO, for a discussion of our quarterly and annual results, and the outlook for the full fiscal year.Switch is a technology infrastructure company, powering the sustainable growth of the connected world. We created small, resilient, and sustainable infrastructure solutions that support the most innovative technology ecosystems. We believe we are highly differentiated, decidedly competitive, and unrivaled in our expansion capacities. We have located each of our four PRIMEs in locations with low cost of electricity, low or no taxes, low cost of telecom, low cost of living, low risk of natural disaster, and with low latency to the major cities in their respective regions, providing coverage to the contiguous United States, while leveraging the cost efficiency of having only four PRIME locations.We build our facilities using Switch modularly optimized designs, or Switch Mods. These designs allow us to rapidly deploy or replace infrastructure to meet our customers' current and future data storage and compute requirements. We deploy capital in a resilient, efficient, and effective manner. Across our current facilities, we have generated on average 19% cash flow yield on invested capital in 2017. Our reputation and track record contribute to our efficient and robust organic growth.Our revenue has grown from $166.8 million in 2013 to $378.3 million in 2017, representing a compound annual growth rate of 23%. For the same years, our adjusted EBITDA grew from $95.5 million to $194.7 million, representing a CAGR of 20%. We have grown our customer base 100% organically and with brand-new, purpose-built facilities. Our customers tend to increase their spending with us over time, demonstrating the power of our brand and the quality of our solutions. Additionally, our average annual customer churn rate over the last three years was just 0.9%, with only 0.6% in 2017, which is the lowest reported churn rate in our industry.After 17 years of consistent organic growth, Switch is now one of the leading technology ecosystems in the world. Our growth, our dedication, and our results continue to expand based on our mission and our values. Our values govern how we operate and what we accomplish, making 2017 another landmark year for Switch. Let's review some of those key accomplishments.Since January 1, 2016, Switch has powered all of its United States data centers with 100% clean and renewable energy. We further advanced Switch's role in sustainability with the launch of Switched On, our power purchasing consortium. We announced Rob Roy's Gigawatt Nevada, the largest solar project in the United States, which will produce among the lowest priced solar power in the world, allowing our customers to receive renewable energy for what we understand to be substantially less that the cost of receiving power from any other source.This underscores our commitment to sustainability and making the Nevada PRIMEs the only Tier 1 market that can offer its customers 100% renewal energy for $0.049 per kilowatt hour. In addition, just as we offer cooperative purchasing of telecom capacity, we now take a similar leadership role by offering to sell power to our customers, not just for their data center deployments within our PRIMEs, but also for their corporate facilities, factories, and other electrical power needs.On March 20, 2018, Switch joined the Western States Power Pool, providing Switch with the access and the ability to sell energy across the Western United States. We also applied for and received our license to sell power from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or FERC on that same date, which allows us to sell power to anyone within the 16-state open state markets, expanding our potential power base for our Gigawatt 1 project.Just as we've committed to sustainability, another one of our core values is committing to our communities through economic development. We believe in building strong communities wherever we operate. In 2017, we continued to exemplify that commitment. In March 2017, we leveraged the Switch SUPERLOOP, an extended fiber, to rural Nevada communities, schools, and hospitals, increasing their internet capacity as much as 2000%. We also support education initiatives. We believe that combining education, technology, and the arts creates a powerful platform for the future of our country and its market competitiveness.In 2017, we proudly sponsored the first robotics competitions in both Las Vegas, Nevada, and Kentwood, Michigan. The event combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology, sparking creativity and innovation in the minds of students while exposing them to possible careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics. Switch also provided more than $3.4 million in critical technology infrastructure support services to power the University of Nevada computing cluster, that will boost research capacity, offering 30X more computing power to better support the latest research applications.We believe that there is truth in technology and in 2017, we further strengthened our intellectual property portfolio, as we granted three additional patents. In 2017, we filed an additional 12 patents on new and innovative technologies. To date, that brings our total to over 500 issued and pending patent claims. One of the patents most recently awarded to Switch was for additional rights for 100% hot aisle containment rows, known as multi-cabinet hot aisle containment chimney pods, which is a critical foundation of Switch's world-class data centers. Underscoring our commitment to excellence was our announcement of the Tier 5 platinum data center standard, setting a new standard of excellence for the data center industry.We also added to our portfolio the build-to-suit Switch Mod data center product line, which can be customized and scaled to meet on-premise customer demand. We leveraged our advanced technology and intellectual property to further enhance our relationships with key suppliers. We recently executed an intellectual property license agreement with Munters Corporation, one of the leading HVAC manufacturers in the colocation industry. This license, in addition to the license agreement with Schneider Electric, further validates the uniqueness of Rob Roy's inventions and provides additional legal protection.Our values drive how we operate and translate to success. We expanded our customer base and added over100 new customers during 2017, and 18 new customers during Q4 2017 alone, including a major Southern California utility, a global home application manufacturer, a global cybersecurity company, a leader in blood services and transfusion medicine, and a marine robotics company.In the fourth quarter of 2017, we consummated a transaction with Hulu. Hulu desired to migrate their existing data centers to a renewable energy center. Hulu made material advances in their environmental initiatives by moving their data center to a facility that eliminates 265,000 carbon tons of emissions from the environment. That's the equivalent of more than 50,000 cars off the road for a full year, further optimizing its relationship with Switch, Hulu leveraged our Switch Core to purchase telecommunication services, taking advantage of material savings over the historical options offered to them from their previous colocation providers. This move allowed Hulu to scale in a way that not only minimizes downtime for its customers, but also provides a stable, direct connection to AWS, allowing Hulu to support the growth of its existing cloud platform.In response to strong demand from existing and new clients, Switch opened Las Vegas 10, adding nearly 340,000 square feet, and up to 50 megawatts of power to our core campus. We began work on our Las Vegas 11 facility, which is planned to open in the fourth quarter of this year. We are also increasing cabinet capacity at The Citadel campus and Pyramid campus. We officially began construction on The Keep campus in Atlanta, Georgia, which we expect to be operational in 2019.We also announced the passage by the State Legislature of what is called the Switch Bill in Georgia. The bill exempted Switch and its clients from sales tax and use tax. The legislation and lobbying were created and led by the Switch strategy team, creating a bill that makes Switch even more competitive nationally in its newest market. To prepare for continued growth, we expanded our sales strategy by growing the non-commissioned, internal sales force to address demand for our West Coast PRIMEs, the Core Campus, and the Citadel campus, and our expanding East Coast presence with the Pyramid Campus and the Keep campus.We aligned with the global, commercial real estate powerhouse, CBRE, to support Switch's strategic expansion and deployment across the United States. We also partnered with Rackspace to materially expand the availability of private cloud and managed service offerings within our ecosystems. The alliance advances the capability of Rackspace's open stack everywhere and HPE pay-as-you-go private cloud, and recognizes the need for customers to have hybrid colocation solutions as part of their IT modernization roadmap.A long list of achievements coupled with our initial public offering in October made 2017 a remarkable year for Switch. There is so much more to come. We believe the total adjustable market for data centers and the myriad of related services contained within those ecosystems remains very strong and Switch will continue to benefit from that inherent growth for the foreseeable future.By leveraging our combined ordering retail ecosystem or CORE, Switch is able to provide its clients and its partner with telecommunications and green electrical power at industry-leading price points, both within our data centers and at their corporate edge locations. CORE also provides Switch with multiple pads to support rapid growth in a stable, steady, and responsible manner. Through Rob Roy's technological innovation, industry partnerships, and public advocacy, Switch develops and operates one of the most advanced technology ecosystems in the world, while safeguarding the future of our plant through its green initiatives.Let me now turn the call over to Gabe to discuss our financial results in more detail. Gabe?Gabe Nacht -- Chief Financial OfficerThanks, Thomas. Today, I'm going to review the financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017. I will then provide our outlook for 2018.In the fourth quarter of 2017, we achieved record quarterly revenue of $99.3 million, an increase of $17.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2016, representing 21% year-over-year organic growth, driven by an increase in the sale of our services to both existing customers and new customers, and driven by additional revenue in our Citadel campus and Pyramid campus, that were brand new in 2016.For the full-year, we achieved record revenue of $378.3 million, representing 19% organic growth over 2016. The increase in revenue in 2017 was driven primarily by increased sales to existing customers, along with the addition of more than 100 new customers as we expanded customers in the Core Campus, the Citadel campus, and the Pyramid campus. For the fourth quarter and full-year 2017, we derived 98% of our revenue from recurring revenue streams, consisting of colocation, which includes the licensing of cabinet space and power, and connectivity services comprised of cross-connects, broadband services, and external connectivity.For the full-year 2017, approximately 16% in the increase in revenue was attributable to the new customers initiating service after December 31, 2016. The remaining approximately 84% of the increase in revenue was attributable to growth from over 800 existing customers. The increase in revenue in 2017 was primarily related to increased volume, rather than an increase in the price as we charge our customers. Colocation revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $79.8 million, an increase of 21% over the $66 million in colocation revenue during Q4 of 2016.Connectivity revenue for Q4 of 2017 was $17.7 million, an increase of 25% over the $14.1 million in the same period in 2016. Other revenue, including professional services, accounted for $1.9 million in Q4 of 2017, up from $1.8 million in the same period in 2016. For the full-year 2017, colocation revenue was $304.7 million, up 18% compared to 2016, while connectivity revenue was $67.7 million, an increase of 26% over 2016. Other revenue for 2017 was $5.9 million, compared to $5.9 million in 2016.The Switch CORE purchasing cooperative continues to drive connectivity revenue growth. Switch clients take advantage of our CORE purchasing cooperative to purchase telecommunication services, but we believe there's tremendous upside in further penetrating our client base for additional telecommunication purchases within their enterprises. For the full-year 2017, connectivity revenue accounted for 18% of total revenue, up from 17% of total revenue in 2016.As Thomas mentioned, in addition to offering cooperative purchasing of telecommunication capacity, we will now start to take a similar leadership role with Switched On, our new energy division. We will purchase and distribute 100% green energy, underscoring our commitment to sustainability and making Switch Nevada the only Tier 1 markets that can offer 100% green power at rates of $0.049 per kilowatt hour to its customers. This compares to, for example, over $0.13 per kilowatt hour that competitors charge for brown power in the Bay Area.Our technology ecosystem creates significant value for our customers and its powerful network effects drive customer loyalty, as has been reflected in our churn rates, which remain among the lowest in the industry. Switch's annual average churn rate for the three years ended 2017 was just 0.9% and was only 0.6% in 2017. Our churn rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 0.3%.In 2017, we achieved $180 million in gross profit, a 20% increase from the $149.5 million in gross profit in 2016. Our gross profit margin improved to 48% in 2017, compared to 47% in 2016. As a reminder, as of June 1, 2017, we became an unbundled purchaser of energy in Nevada, allowing Switch to purchase 100% green energy from a variety of sources and at reduced prices, contributing to our increase in gross profit.Turning now to operating expenses, cost of revenue increased by 17% to $198.2 million in 2017, compared to $168.6 million in 2016, primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization costs of $20.9 million, and costs associated with increased occupancy and expansion of the Core campus, the Citadel campus, and the Pyramid campus.In 2017, SG&A was $160.6 million for the year, compared to $71.4 million in 2016. In 2017, SG&A increased 125% compared to 2016, which was in large part attributable to a non-recurring equity-based compensation charge of $71.3 million, resulting primarily from the accelerated vesting of certain incentive units upon our IPO, and awards granted under the 2017 incentive award grant. We also incurred a $5.6 million increase in professional services fees for legal and accounting services as we prepared for the IPO, and a $5.4 million increase in salaries and related expenses, predominantly due to an increase in headcount.Income from operations in 2017 declined to $18.8 million, compared to $51.1 million in 2016, due to the additional equity-based compensation expense related to the IPO. We incurred a loss from operations of $54.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. First is the loss from operations of $7.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of the non-recurring equity-based compensation expense related to the IPO, operating income for 2017 would have increased 77%.Our net loss in 2017 was $8.6 million, and included the non-recurring charge of approximately $71.3 million in equity-based compensation expense. Fourth quarter 2017 net loss was $60.3 million. We generated net income of $31.4 million in 2016, and a net loss of $19.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Interest expense increased by $14.2 million to $25.1 million in 2017, compared to $10.8 million in 2016, primarily driven by our outstanding long-term debt, which increased from $472.1 million at year-end 2016, to $591.8 million at year-end 2017.Adjusted EBITDA totaled $194.7 million for the full-year 2017, a 27% increase compared to adjusted EBITDA of $153.2 million in 2016. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2017 increased to 51.5%, compared to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.1% in 2016, following our investments in 2016 in advance of opening the Citadel campus and the Pyramid campus.CapEx for 2017 totaled $402.6 million, up from $287.1 million in 2016, an increase of 40%. We deployed $201 million of capital in our Core campus in response to additional customer demand in density needs, in opening our Las Vegas 12 facility and 2 new sectors in Las Vegas 10. We also added 20 megawatts of power and cooling capacity, and we began work on our Las Vegas 11 facility, which is planned to open in late 2018 or early 2019, depending on customer demand, and adding another 340,000 gross square feet of space and up to 40 megawatts of capacity.We also invested $127 million in the Citadel campus, opening two additional sectors and supporting 20 megawatts of additional power and cooling capacity. In 2017, we spent $68 million on the Pyramid campus, opening one new sector and adding 10 megawatts of power and cooling. In Q4 of 2017, we also exercised our purchase option for the Pyramid property, purchasing the building and 142 acres of land for $23.9 million.2017 CapEx came in above our guided range of $345 million to $365 million, as we purchased additional parcels of land in Las Vegas and Atlanta totaling 22 acres for $15.3 million. Additionally, we accelerated the purchase of $14.8 million in equipment to take average of year-end discounts. Neither of these were included in our previous guidance. Maintenance CapEx for 2017 was $4.6 million and was 1.2% of revenue, compared to $5.1 million and 1.6% of revenue in 2016. Growth CapEx was $398 million in 2017, compared to $282 million in 2016.Our existing PRIME campus locations currently encompass an aggregate of 4 million gross square feet of space and up to 415 megawatts of power. As of the end of 2017, the utilization rates of these PRIMEs, based on currently available data center space, were approximately 91%, 52%, and 50% at the Core campus, the Citadel campus, and the Pyramid campus respectively. Recall that we build our facilities using Switch modularly designs, which allow us to rapidly deploy infrastructure to meet our customers' current and future data storage and compute requirements. As we open additional sectors, utilize rates temporarily decline because we are making the space available in anticipation of established customer requirements.Looking now at the balance sheet, on June 27, 2017, Switch executed a new $1.1 billion credit facility consisting of a $500 million revolving line of credit and a $600 million term loan. As of December 31, 2017, the company's total debt outstanding net of cash and cash equivalents, was $349 million, resulting in a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of just 1.7X. At year-end 2017, Switch had liquidity of $765 million, and we believe this is sufficient to fund our growth plans for the foreseeable future without the need to go back to the capital markets and further dilute investors.Now turning to guidance. For 2018, revenue is expected to be in the range of $423 million to $440 million. Our revenue guidance for 2018 over 2017 implies 14% growth at the mid-point. This guidance includes a $9.4 million revenue impact due to fees booked in 2017 related to a 7-year, $280 million contract closed in 2016 with a strategic customer to reserve space at one of our facilities. At the time, the customer was in the process of separating into two independent companies and was not yet certain of the space they would need but contracted with Switch to keep space available through 2017 to provide them with time to finalize their split.Starting in January of 2018, the contract provides for a minimum usage floor which increases monthly through June of 2018, with expectations for usage to return to usual levels in 2019. Adjusted for the impact of this contract, the midpoint of revenue guidance for 2018 would imply growth of 17%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $216 million to $224 million, implying growth of 13% at midpoint. This, too, includes the impact of the fee discussed above. Adjusting for the impact of this specific contract, the midpoint of our EBITDA guidance implies EBITDA growth of 16% in 2018.CapEx is expected to be in the range of $260 million to $310 million. As an UP-C company, Switch will be reporting earnings-per-share numbers based on the shares at Switch Inc. and the earnings attributable to Switch, Inc. based on its percentage ownership in Switch Ltd. In summary, Switch achieved another year of record annual revenue. Our technology ecosystem continues to create significant value for our customers and its powerful network effects drive customer loyalty. We believe the company is well-positioned to continue this success into 2018 and beyond.Thank you, and let me turn the call back to Thomas for some closing remarks.Thomas Morton -- President and General CounselThe growth opportunity ahead of Switch is significant. We are currently working with the largest funnel of enterprise retail colocation opportunities we have ever seen as a company. These opportunities are spread across all three of our current PRIMEs. The Core campus, the Citadel campus, and the Pyramid campus. Since the beginning of 2018, we've signed two additional large contracts for our Pyramid campus, committing most of the currently available space within that facility. Our industry-leading hyperscale facilities, combined with our CORE connectivity and Switched On energy divisions position Switch for continued organic growth.I would once again like to take this opportunity on behalf of our management team to thank our employees, customers, and our partners for their commitment and continued support of Switch.Questions and Answers:OperatorLadies and gentlemen, we will now open the call for questions today. If you would like to ask a question, people press *1 on your telephone keypad. If you're on a speakerphone, please make sure that your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Once again, for any questions at this time, please press *1 now and we'll pause for just a moment.Our first question will come from Richard Choe with JP Morgan.Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question at this time, please press *1 now. Once again, if you would like to ask a question, please press *1 now. Again, we will go to Richard Choe for our first question from JP Morgan.Richard Choe -- JP Morgan -- AnalystHi, just wanted to ask a question on CapEx. Came in a little bit higher in the quarter and the guide for '18 seems higher. What's driving it higher? In terms of sequential revenue growth, how would be thinking about it? It was lower than in the fourth quarter from third quarter than the previous quarters. How should we think about it through the year and what's driving it? Thank you.Gabe Nacht -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Richard. This is Gabe. As far as CapEx, CapEx was a bit higher in the fourth quarter because we actually took advantage of a couple of opportunities that came up. We had the opportunity to purchase some additional plots of land around our Atlanta facility, which actually houses some residential properties today. Having residential properties next to our data center isn't ideal. So when those opportunities came up to purchase those properties, we took advantage of it.We are also taking advantage of some additional property that came to market next to our innovation center here in Las Vegas. If you've been to our facility, you see part of the open land that's next to our innovation center. We wanted to take advantage of that as well. That was about a $15 million purchase that was unplanned.Secondly, because we had liquidity following the IPO, we were sitting on around $800 or so million of cash and liquidity, we took advantage of some discounts afforded to us by our suppliers to take early commitment on some equipment that we would otherwise have taken in Q1 of 2018. That was about another $15 million acceleration of capital. As we move into '18, we've got a couple of things going on.Clearly Atlanta is moving quickly, and so we've got an acceleration in that property of about $60 to $70 million of CapEx slated for Atlanta in 2018. We're also building our Las Vegas 11 facility here in Las Vegas, which also should take about $60 to $70 million of CapEx in 2018. Additionally, we're continuing to expand our Las Vegas 10 facility as customers fill into that. Those are the main things are driving CapEx a bit higher than what we otherwise would have projected. But once Atlanta is built and Las Vegas 11 is built, at that point we'll just be filling those facilities and we won't be building a significant new building in '19.Richard Choe -- JP Morgan -- AnalystIs that why the revenue growth is not -- I guess it's still solid, but not ramping as fast at the CapEx. Is that this is more stuff you're building in '18 that will impact '19 in terms of revenue?Thomas Morton -- President and General CounselYeah, Richard. This is Thomas. Some of the things that came up there were, as Gabe said, this is future expansion land that we saw the opportunity to secure and we acted strategically to acquire that land. It is not land that we will need this year or next year, but land is something that when it comes up, we like to secure it. It allowed us to secure our perimeter and make sure that the campus was fully ours. So, we took advantage of the opportunity. Then also, as Gabe mentioned, the ability to take advantage of discounted equipment and offerings at the end of the year spiked a bit of more CapEx in order to lower the overall cost for the infrastructure of pieces that we were procuring.Gabe Nacht -- Chief Financial OfficerWith regard to the sequential revenue growth, Richard, we feel very happy with the fourth quarter performance. We had a good, strong quarter. As we move into '18, however, as I mentioned on the call, we do have a bit of an anomaly because of this contract that we entered into with our strategic customer that is about a $9 million, $9.4 million impact into '18. Most of that is front-loaded in the year into the first and second quarters. So, that does present a bit of a sequential growth challenge, but we're still expecting to see good, strong growth, particularly adjusted for the impact of that contract.Richard Choe -- JP Morgan -- AnalystThank you.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, once again, if you'd like to ask a question, please press *1 now. Once again, if you'd like to ask a question, please press *1 now. Our next question will come from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse.Sami Badri -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystThank you. I just have a question on connectivity revenues accelerating at 25% year-over-year in the quarter and 26% in 2017 as a whole. What is driving this growth and how sustainable is this growth through 2018? Should we expect 25% year-over-year to be the right growth run rate or is this there some kind of one-off event driving that kind of growth within the year just in '17 and not going to happen in 2018?[Inaudible] [00:36:42]There wasn't any one-off event planning. [Inaudible].Sami Badri -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystI'm sorry, I can't really hear you.Thomas Morton -- President and General Counsel-- strong area of growth for us. As you know, most of our clients do take advantage of our core purchasing cooperative in one form or another, but we're finding additional upside and tremendous opportunity in further penetrating those clients into their enterprises. As their enterprise telecommunications contracts come up for renewal, we're able to allow them to leverage core and to continue to grow that.A couple of other things driving it are cross-connects, as we've talked about in the past. We are more aggressively monetizing cross-connects than we have in the past. Cross-connect revenue grew over 30% for the year, so that was helping to drive growth. Our agency revenue has also driven growth. There's no one specific event that's driving that, just a great opportunity for our CORE purchasing cooperative.Gabe Nacht -- Chief Financial OfficerSami, just like our internal sales force for colocation, we have also expanded our internal sales force for connectivity in order to continue to fuel and foster growth in that area. We see that as a key differentiator for us as a company and as more of our customers learn about it and try it, the more that they tend to procure in it, so we see that as something that will grow and continue to accelerate in years to come.Sami Badri -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystGot it. Thank you. Sorry to ask this again, I think there was a little bit of a cut-off in the beginning of your response. Is around 25% growth year-over-year as the run rate, is that the right level we should think about or is it above or below that? I don't know if you guys mentioned that.Thomas Morton -- President and General CounselWe really don't provide any forward-looking guidance on the specific revenue components. You've got our guidance for 2018 and we expect connectivity to continue to play an important part of that.Gabe Nacht -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd as I said, Sami, we are investing in fostering and continuing that growth.Sami Badri -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystGreat, thank you. Then just one last question on eBay and PayPal, is the majority of the noise and the churn involved with those formerly one-customer turned to two customers, has the majority of that noise passed us already or do you guys still see an element of noise coming from specifically those two customers?Thomas Morton -- President and General CounselI wouldn't necessarily term it as noise. As I spoke about in our comments, there is a revenue adjustment that is baked into the 2018 numbers, particularly in the first half of that year, associated with that transaction, but actually since the companies have split, we've picked up additional revenue from the split-off partner of that. So, that's been a tremendous success. The contract that we have with eBay is a 7-year deal that's got monthly revenue targets that are set in stone as part of that contract. I really wouldn't term it as noise. I do think there's an element that impacts revenue in the first half of the year, which we've spoken about. But in general, we're very happy with the way that contract is going. We've got a great relationship with eBay. We have a great relationship with PayPal and they've just signed a contract for a significant amount of cabinets.Sami Badri -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystGot it, great. Thank you.OperatorOur next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond JamesFrank Louthan -- Raymond James -- AnalystGreat, thank you. Can you walk us through some of the new logos that you've signed? How should we think about that as far as new verticals and so forth? If you look out a year from now, how should we think about the makeup in Grand Rapids and in Atlanta? Is it going to be mostly existing names or are you expecting some new growth, some new customers? How should we think about that next?Gabe Nacht -- Chief Financial OfficerThe verticals, we do have a slide that provides some additional info on that, Frank, on our website that talks about the verticals of those 18 new logos. We had folks in retail and consumer goods, cloud and IT software, government and utilities, including a very large Southern California utility. We had a Fortune 100 company, at least a subsidiary, that does some underwater exploration for a Global 100 company. We have digital content and media. It was across the board. Our diversity of industry type and our diversity of customers remains very healthy.As we move toward Atlanta, I think we'll see, just as we have in Michigan, a mix of both new customers and expansion from existing customers.[Crosstalk]Thomas Morton -- President and General CounselOn a general theme, Frank, we tend to continue to attract the types of customers that we have in the performance, those that are looking for high-performance compute, those that are looking for high amounts of connectivity, and/or those that are highly regulated, and any blend of those three. So, those are the customers that we attract and retain very well as a company. We expect to see that trend continue going forward.Frank Louthan -- Raymond James -- AnalystGreat. How many carriers do you have currently going into the Grand Rapids site and what do you expect to have in Atlanta when that's up and running?Thomas Morton -- President and General CounselWe have in the double digits on our Grand Rapids site. We have double digits in Reno. We obviously have more than that here in Las Vegas. But we have all of the major carriers already connected to those sites. Atlanta is a very connected area. Frank, I think that you know our campus is going in across from Google's campus on the East Coast, so it's already a very connected site and we expect to have double-digit number of carriers there as well, which is really what we need to foster our CORE purchasing cooperative.Frank Louthan -- Raymond James -- AnalystGreat, thank you very much.OperatorNext we'll take a question from Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets.Tim Long -- BMO Capital Markets -- AnalystThank you. Two questions if I could. First, Thomas, you talked about some expansion of the sales force. How should we think about it? Obviously, you've got CapEx strong this year, so expecting good growth. How should we think about the sales force productivity and the ability to go out and sign new logos from here. How long do you think it will take your sales force expansion to show up in the numbers?Then separately, if you could talk a little bit about Switched On. You made the correlation with CORE. Obviously, CORE is important for revenues and churn. But if you could just talk a little bit about the business model behind Switched On, how do you think that will manifest itself in the model? Do you think there will be a revenue component or just a cost component? Obviously, it should help churn. Will any of this, do you think, be passed on to the bottom line of the income statement?Thomas Morton -- President and General CounselThank you. I'll let Gabe talk to specific numbers, but as far as expansion of the sales force, you might recall from our last earnings call we said we were going to do three things. One was to expand the internal sales force, which we have done by adding at least six new bodies to that sales force. Secondly, we were going to align ourselves with a major brokerage house, which we have done by aligning ourselves with CBRE. Thirdly, we said we were going to broaden and enhance our relationship with managed services providers, which we have done by signing the agreement with Rackspace.So, all three of those items will distribute to our growth in three different ways. We believe that they not only de-risk the ability back East, but they will enhance and accelerate the growth in those areas. As to Switched On, Switched On we have not put in the model for this year. We were recently given our FERC license and we are beginning to work with our customers to sell power to them, but we need some time to and they need some time to figure out how they can buy from us, and what price points in the deployment strategy we will have with that.But we do see that in the future being a material contributor to our bottom line. It is something that we are pursuing with great zeal.Gabe Nacht -- Chief Financial OfficerWith regard to the -- you mentioned Switched On -- is that going to be a revenue contributor or a cost contributor? It isn't going to be a cost contributor. The way we've structured that partnership is that partnership with Capital Dynamics. Capital Dynamics is a very large developer of solar properties in North America. They're actually taking the financial component of that and developing our gigawatt solar facility, which will enable Switch to lock in 4.9% green power for as much as we can possibly use.Given our FERC license, we can now begin reselling that power to our customers at that same $0.049, which we think is a tremendously attractive opportunity for us and for our customers, and a tremendous opportunity to continue to do the right thing from a sustainability perspective for Switch and for its customers. We do expect to make money on it, but that is not in our guidance for '18 right now because as Tom has said, we expect that to take a bit of time to begin showing fruit. If it shows up early, that's a bonus, but it's not in our current '18 guidance.Tim Long -- BMO Capital Markets -- AnalystOkay, thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company.Colby Synesael -- Cowen & Company -- AnalystGreat, thank you. Your margin guidance implies 51%, whereas you did about 51.5% in 2017. I would've thought with the ability to now sell power, or unbundle power, excuse me, that happened in the midpoint of '17, that we could see margins go up in '18. I'm trying to understand why that's not happening. Maybe it's because the CORE product is becoming a greater percentage of revenue or maybe it's just the fall-off of eBay, maybe it's 100% margin, but I was hoping to get a little more color on that.Secondly, to follow up on the CapEx question, you mentioned the two projects which equate to, based on the numbers you provided, $120 to $140 million, whereas your CapEx guidance is $260 to $310 million. I was hoping you could give us a little more specificity where the remaining CapEx dollars are going.Gabe Nacht -- Chief Financial OfficerFirst, let me tackle the margin question and then Colby, I'm sorry, you broke up a bit on the CapEx, so I may ask you to repeat that question. But as far as our margin, we've stated for quite some time that our long-term target for EBITDA is about 51% and we use a variety of tools to manage that process, not only one the colocation pricing, but on the telecom pricing and in the future, power pricing as well.We believe that number is a number that is sustainable for us, that is a number that keeps our customers very happy, it makes them feel like they're getting true value. We think it's a healthy number and it keeps our churn down. Our churn for this year was 0.6%. So, we essentially have no churn. That really does pay off in margin for us because we're not start each year having to find $40 million of revenue just to get to zero. That has a tremendous positive impact on Switch. As far as --Colby Synesael -- Cowen & Company -- AnalystYou're managing to the -- I'm sorry, go ahead.Gabe Nacht -- Chief Financial OfficerAs far as the actual number itself, yes, we're a bit above that in the back half of '17 or for the full-year of '17, but there's a couple of offsetting dynamics. In the back half of '17, we had the full advantage of becoming an unbundled purchaser of power, which lowered our power cost and boosted our margin. As we move into '18, we still have that benefit but we have a bit of an offset on having some higher SG&A cost related to being a public company, whereas in the first half of '17 we were a private company. There are just some ongoing costs associated with that. We're targeting about a 51% margin for the year and expect to be in that range.Colby Synesael -- Cowen & Company -- AnalystDid you say you're managing the business to 51%? So that's your long-term target so that's what we should assume going forward? I just want to make sure I heard that.Gabe Nacht -- Chief Financial OfficerThat's correct.Colby Synesael -- Cowen & Company -- AnalystOkay. Then on the CapEx, just to repeat it. In response to one of the questions, you mentioned Atlanta $60 to $70 million, at least I thought that's what you said. And Vegas 11 another $60 to $70 million, which is the $120 to $140 million. Obviously, guidance is much higher than that. I was just hoping you could fill out the remaining portion.Thomas Morton -- President and General CounselYeah, we have additional spending in the Citadel as we expand in Reno. We expect $65 to $75 million there. We're continuing to expand in the Pyramid campus and there will be about $30 to $35 million there. Then we have our corporate CapEx as well. So, that's what fills out that pipeline. But the majority are the two new buildings that are being constructed -- one in Atlanta, one here in Las Vegas. That's what's boosting CapEx a bit higher than we would've expected. Just to go back to the margin point, Colby, when I talk about managing our margins, we've talked about the fact that is our long-term target.While others have come to us and said, Switch has a superior product, why don't we charge more? Why don't we boost our margins? We think that's a bit of a short-term strategy. We could boost our margins to 55% or 60%, but our customers see that. Our customers would start making other decisions for their long-term investments and we'd rather have them stay with Switch over the long run. We believe in the karma wheel, which is our logo. We do right by our customers, they do right by us. We think that 50% to 51% range is a range that has worked for us historically, and kept our churn very well.Colby Synesael -- Cowen & Company -- AnalystThank you, Gabe. Thank you, Tom.OperatorOnce again, if you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press *1 now. Next, we'll take a question from Edward Parker from BTIG.Hearing no response, we'll move on to Michael Rollins from Citi Research.Michael Rollins -- Citi Research -- AnalystHi, thanks. A couple if I could. How many cabinets were billing at the end of 2017? Secondly, could you talk about the implications of tax reform, both in terms of at the UP-C level? As well as any changes to the cash distribution requirements you may reimburse your partners with. Thanks.Gabe Nacht -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Mike. This is Gabe. I'll take that. As far as the cabinets that were billed over, we're not disclosing that quite yet. I know everyone wants to get the cabinet metrics, but there's so much of our business that is not necessarily dependent. Cabinet numbers really also depend on density and utilization. Our densities are really different than others. So, at this point, we're still not disclosing the cabinet number.As far as tax reform, we think tax reform is a benefit for us all the way around. As a C-corp, which it does for us is obviously lowers the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. But at the partnership level, where the operations are, it also allows us to take advantage of bonus depreciation for our equipment, up to 100%, as we purchase that equipment. We don't expect to be a taxpayer in 2017. We don't expect to be a taxpayer in 2018. We think tax reform is a benefit for us.Thomas Morton -- President and General CounselThis is Thomas. By lowering the individual tax rate, obviously, it lowered our tax distributions at the Ltd. level as well.Gabe Nacht -- Chief Financial OfficerBut as the Ltd. does not have taxable income, there will be no tax distribution to our members.Michael Rollins -- Citi Research -- AnalystThank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question will come from Eric Luchow from Wells Fargo.Hearing no response, we will move on to Scott Goldman from Jefferies.Scott Goldman -- Jefferies -- AnalystGood afternoon. A couple questions. One, obviously churn continues to come in at very healthy levels. Just wondering how you guys look at churn in 2018? What kind of visibility do you have? Can we expect it to remain at similar levels as to what we're seeing right now? Then I guess, just on the revenue guidance, a two-part question if I could. One, what's embedded as you look at the revenue guide from a pricing versus volume standpoint? I assume volume is still the primary driver or significant driver of revenue, but just want to confirm that. Then as it relates to the $9.4 million stepdown, are you seeing that customer is operating at those minimum commitment levels? Or is there a chance that we could see them run above the minimum commitment levels that have been established as part of that contract? Thanks.Gabe Nacht -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Scott. This is Gabe. I'll take that. As far as our churn, our visibility into churn, because we are a hyperscale colocation provider with over 800 customers, we're not dependent on any specific large contracts or large leases that may be coming up for renewal. So, our churn has averaged under 1.5% for a very long time and for the past years is now under 1%. As far as our visibility into churn in the future, we have a number of our contracts that come up for normal renewal cycles because our contracts are 3 to 5 years, but what we've found is that customers renew and expand and they don't leave.But the main component of our churn tends to be when customers merge and we really don't have a lot of visibility into that because when two of our clients merge, as telcos often do, sometimes they'll consolidate their footprint within our facility. So, we don't have a lot of visibility into that. We really don't have customers that leave us for other facilities. That's really not a component of our churn. We expect our churn to continue to be low, as it has for years, and really provide a benefit to our stable revenue and to our ability to grow from that stable revenue base.As far as the growth that we're guiding in '18, the vast majority of that will come from expansion of our existing customers and from new customers, as opposed to price increases. We typically raise our prices annually between 1.7% to 2.5%, and we're expecting to raise prices in that same neighborhood in 2018. But the vast majority of growth will come from expansion of both existing customers and new customers.As far as the client's minimum monthly usage contract and what we're actually seeing, we are actually seeing that client use in an excess of their minimum monthly usage here in Las Vegas, and in our Tahoe Reno campus and the Citadel campus, that monthly usage has stepped down to the base level at the beginning of '18. They are hitting those numbers. We expect them to grow in our Tahoe Reno campus and would expect that same pattern that we're seeing here in Las Vegas.Thomas Morton -- President and General CounselThis is Tom. With respect to churn, just to be very clear, we don't have any reason to expect the churn to be any different than it has been historically. We don't have any known off-puts or customers exiting or anything like that to our knowledge. So, there's no reason, to our knowledge, that empirical churn should not stay at the levels it has been.Secondly, eBay or this customer has been meeting their minimums and though we can't forecast differently, we have no reason to believe that they will not meet or exceed the minimum deployments.[Crosstalk]Gabe Nacht -- Chief Financial OfficerWe are actually exceeding that in Las Vegas?Michael Rollins -- Citi Research -- AnalystOkay, so in terms of what's built into your revenue guidance, is that sort of at current run-rate levels with the minimum step-ups? For example, in Reno, where they're at the base level, are you just assuming they stay at the base level with just a step-up and don't exceed at that point in time?Gabe Nacht -- Chief Financial OfficerThat's correct. Our guidance is based on the contractual minimums to date. So, if they exceed that, that's a bonus. As I think most of you on the phone know, we do tend to be relatively conservative in the way we run the company and in our guidance, and so we've baked in guidance at the minimum usage levels.Mark G. Parker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive OfficerUnderstood.

Kurt?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentThanks, Michael. Overall revenues for the third fiscal quarter grew to $332.4 million from $332.2 million in the second quarter. Sale of datacom products increased by $9.5 million or 3.7% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Primarily this was from strong demand of record revenues in our third fiscal quarter from 100-gig QSFP28 transceivers for data center as well as higher revenue for our VCSEL arrays for 3D sensing.This was offset by lower sales of our 40-gig QSFP and 100-gig CFP and CFP2 ethernet transceivers. Sales of telecom products decreased by $9.3 million or 12.3% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily driven by the impact of one month of the annual telecom price reductions and lower revenues from our Chinese OEM customers. In the second quarter, we had two 10% or greater customers. Our top 10 customers represented 63.3% of total revenues compared to 60.2% in the second quarter.Non-GAAP gross margin was 28.6% compared to 30.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to unfavorable product mix, the impact of one month of the telecom price reductions and the non-cash impact of an increase in inventory reserves. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $72.4 million compared to $74.6 million in the second quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $22.7 million or 6.8% of revenue compared to $25.9 million or 7.8% of revenue in the second quarter, primarily due to lower gross margins. Interest and other income was approximately $3 million in the quarter.Non-GAAP income was $22.8 million or $0.20 per diluted share compared to $26.1 million or $0.23 in the second quarter, primarily due to lower gross margins and to higher non-GAAP taxes. Non-GAAP taxes for the third quarter were approximately $3 million. This increase of $0.8 million over the second quarter was primarily the result of an unrealized gain in China due to the weakening U.S. dollar relative to the Chinese renminbi.This had an approximate $0.01 negative impact on our non-GAAP earnings per share. During the third quarter, for GAAP purposes, we had a onetime approximately $42 million non-cash tax expense as the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017. Non-GAAP tax rate for the fiscal fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 11%. The non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal '19 is expected to be approximately 11% to 13%.Average diluted shares for the third quarter for non-GAAP purposes totaled 115.7 million. Average diluted shares are expected to be approximately 116 million in the fourth fiscal quarter. Capital expenditures excluding Sherman taxes were approximately $38.6 million from the third quarter. In addition, during the quarter, we spent approximately $20.2 million related to the purchase of an approximately 700,000 square-foot facility in Sherman, Texas.This new site will be used to expand our manufacturing capacity for VCSELs using 6-inch wafers. Construction continues on the third building of our Wuxi manufacturing's site. We expect construction of this building will be completed in the second half of calendar 2018. Capital expenditures, excluding Sherman, for the fourth quarter are estimated to be $45 million, of which approximately $8 million is related to the construction and fit out of the third Wuxi manufacturing building.In addition, for Sherman, for the uplift of the building and additional equipment, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $55 million in the fourth quarter. We excluded from our non-GAAP results a number of charges or benefits were either non-cash or considered outside of our core ongoing operating results. These totaled $78.5 million of charges last quarter. If you include all these items as required under GAAP, we generated net positive $55.7 million or $0.49 per diluted share compared to net income of 5.8 -- $5.9 million or $0.05 per diluted share in the second quarter.That concludes my comments, and I'll turn it back to Michael.Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Kurt. We expect revenues for our fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million. The expected decline in revenues compared to the prior quarter is driven primarily by lower demand for our VCSEL arrays, lower revenues from 40-gig datacom transceivers and lower telecom revenue, driven primarily by the full 3-month impact of the telecom price reductions that Kurt spoke to earlier. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margins to be approximately 27% to 28% as a result of the impact of lower revenue levels and the full three months of the annual telecom price negotiation, which typically take effect on January 1.We expect operating expenses to be relatively flat, and non-GAAP operating margins are expected to be approximately 4%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $0.09 to $0.15 per share. While our third quarter financial performance is disappointing and the outlook for the industry in the next few quarters expected to be challenging, I'm optimistic that we can ultimately improve our financial results through a combination of improved execution and a healthier demand environment. We are currently reviewing all aspects on how we do business in the markets we participate in.I expect that I'll be able to share with you all a complete vision of our plans for the company in our next earnings call in June. While I believe the near term will remain challenging for the industry, this type of environment often creates exciting opportunities. In addition, I believe we can ultimately restore the company's gross and operating margins back to historic levels over time. With that, I'm going to turn it back over to Chantel and open it up for questions.Chantel?--------------------------------Questions and Answers:Operator[Operator's Instructions] Your first question comes from Joseph Wolf with Barclays. Your line is open.Joseph Wolf -- BarclaysThank you very much for taking my question, and welcome, Michael. I guess, given the margin profile in the guidance, I'm wondering if you could point any bright spots in telecom if there are any comments on the ROADM business or the qualification of all of your products in U.S. Metro or things we could point to as positive. And then any commentary we could have on overall datacom pricing and the impact that, that is having on gross margin?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentWell, I'll start with your last part of your question first and maybe then I'll turn it over to Michael to talk about some of the new products on the telecom side. Certainly, as we know, last calendar year, we were largely in a constrained environment in our 100-gig QSFP28 product line, and as we talked about in the past, it has relatively benign pricing environment. I think given now that there's more of an equilibrium between supply and demand, we are definitely seeing stronger price erosion and competition as it relates to that 100-gig QSFP28 product line.Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd let me add a little bit, Kurt. I'd say in general, the telecom environments has been pressed by these price reductions that we talked about that we saw beginning in the calendar year. We do expect some improvement in the back half of the year, primarily coming from our WSS product line. We expect some uplift in the Chinese market, and we should see some improvement there.Joseph Wolf -- BarclaysOK. And then just one last question on gross margin. If you take a look at all the CAPEX for the new facility and you consider some sort of timing toward the end of this year or early next year, should there be an up -- how quickly will that translate into an uptick in gross margin overall?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentWell, I think ultimately, uptick in gross margin, especially as it relates to the Sherman facility, is going to come down to volume and yields. And so there will be a ramp period, of course. But as we've said before, we expect our VCSEL arrays for 3D sensing to be margin accretive for our company. But we got to get Sherman up and running and like I said, it's highly volume and yield dependent.Joseph Wolf -- BarclaysOK. Thanks, Kurt and Michael.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Troy Jensen with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.Troy Jensen -- Piper JaffrayHey, thanks for taking my question. I'm looking forward to working with you, Michael. Quick question on Telco, if we can dive into that a little bit more. I mean, most of the competitors in the space here have been reporting strength in the telco business and understanding that one-month telco pricing erosion.But can you talk about -- did the ROADMs grow sequentially? Did the ACO qualifications start to ramp? Any more color would be great.Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentSure. So I think WSS, in general, was actually flat to down a little bit. We had a strong quarter in WSS the prior quarter. In terms of -- I think your second part of your question was the CFP2 ACO, we haven't really seen an uptick in that yet.As we had mentioned last quarter, we did get qualifications done with a key customer. However, I think as Jerry mentioned on the last call, we believe that customer has some inventory. And so we're really not going to see the benefit of that until fiscal '19.Troy Jensen -- Piper JaffrayAnd Kurt, a follow-up for you here, can you just talk about when you guys on load the Sherman facility, I mean, what do you think happens to the gross margin profile? When would that impact the model? Will you non-GAAP that out of the estimates?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentI'm sorry, when you said we unload the facility?Troy Jensen -- Piper JaffrayNo, when you on load, when the facility comes on and there's no revenues but expenses. Can you just talk about what the gross and operating margins will look like?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentSure. So I think, again, we had this quarter as it related to Sherman approximately about $600k of expenses. And I think if you look the non-GAAP -- GAAP/non-GAAP reconciliation, we excluded that from the results. So we're going to be incurring start-up costs before we get to commercial production in Sherman, and we are non-GAAP-ing those out and that amounted to, in this quarter, a small amount of only $600k.But those expenses are definitely going to ramp significantly as we get closer and closer to getting that facility up and running and ultimately, going into commercial production.Troy Jensen -- Piper JaffrayGot it. Last question, I'll cede the floor. Can you let us know who have any VCSEL design wins for tablets?Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerWe can't comment around specific design wins. I think -- we're obviously optimistic about the space, and we see quite a bit of opportunity. And I think the number of opportunity is increasing. But to get into where the opportunities are with which customers is probably not appropriate.Troy Jensen -- Piper JaffrayUnderstood. I'll see you guys next week.OperatorOur next question comes from Patrick Newton with Stifel.Patrick Newton -- StifelYeah, good afternoon, Michael and Kurt. Thank you for taking my question. Welcome to the team, Michael. First one, Kurt is to, I guess, ask some gross margin questions at different way, maybe a 2-part question.Number one is, could you help us understand how big of a headwind the 3D sensing business is currently, given the Allen facility. I'm guessing it's staff up for larger ramp than perhaps you saw. And then, I guess, secondly, you've had pretty good line of sight on intermediate-term margin trends in the past, given kind of a pipeline of new product introductions or ways that you thought mix could change. And I guess, is there anything that you see in the pipeline that could improve your mix a few quarters out? Or should we read the commentary from Michael saying that there's some softness in the intermediate term to mean that margins could kind of stand the sub-30s range for multi-quarter period?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYes. I guess, to take the first part of your question, certainly, we're not producing and selling as many VCSEL arrays as we'd like at this point in time. And like we said and I think Michael said, we're working on our yields. They're not where we would like them to be.So obviously, as we continue to make progress there both from a production perspective but from a demand perspective, then that should be helpful to us. I think in the second part of the question, I do think, again, the pricing environment is definitely more challenging than it was last year, especially on the datacom. And so that is kind of a headwinds for this business right now. So I'd say we never give more than one-quarter guidance as you know very well, either on revenue or on margins.But certainly, I think the near term appears challenging, but we are optimistic in the back half, things will start to improve both in terms of, hopefully, some revenue on the core business but also additional VCSEL business.Yes.Patrick Newton -- StifelOK. And then, Michael, I find it pretty interesting that you spent more than the last 15 years of your life in the semiconductor company that was pioneered in shifting to the fabless model and also very aggressive with M&A, and now you're the CEO of an optical company that has its roots solidly tied to vertical integration in an industry that nearly all participants believes requires consolidation. So I know you've only been at the helm for less than a quarter, but I'd appreciate your thoughts on how you're thinking about an outsourced model versus vertical integration and what your view is on the need and potential for consolidation in the industry in Finisar's rule?Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, Patrick, I read the comments from last quarter, and it look liked you were throwing your hat in the ring for this job. So you would have been excellent at this. I think in both comments, first, with respect to the vertical integration. As I said, what's going on right now is really I'm reviewing all aspects of the business and trying to apply some of what we did have in outsourced model and look at this through a new lens.I would say at this point, everything's on the table. And I think in the asymptote in a lot of the businesses the vertical integration strategy absolutely makes sense, but we're looking at everything at this point. And then I think relative to mergers and acquisitions, as you said it's probably too early to comment in any specific. I do think that there are challenges here and that you've got a number of companies who are supplying components to Chinese vendors and other vendors are able to put together modules, and that presents a challenge to really do significant roll ups.But we're looking at everything. And as we said in the remarks, we're definitely going to come back in June with some more specifics in terms of what our longer-term plans are.Patrick Newton -- StifelGreat. Thank you for taking the questions and good luck on the quarter.Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Patrick.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham & Company. Your line is open.Alex Henderson -- Needham & Co.Thanks. A couple of questions, first off, on the pricing side of the equation. I know you guys had said the pricing was fairly stable in the back half of calendar '17, and that you're now starting to see heavy price erosion now. But isn't that simply a function of the way you've contracted the prices over the course of the last year as opposed to keeping track of market prices? In other words, if you had been marking the market prices over the last two or three quarters, I think the prices came down quite hard in the back half of last year and may have -- maybe not declining as much as you're seeing now.Can you talk about the discrepancy between market prices and your prices, those two alternative trajectories?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentWell, I think as we talked about in the last couple of calls, I think our team did a great job in the second half of the calendar year, kind of optimizing margins and revenue based on the fact that we were definitely still in a constrained environment, which I think is the point that you're getting to, Alex. But you're correct, as supplies equaled demand and we've reached more of an equilibrium, and we're definitely seeing more price erosion now. How that's comparing to the price erosion, our competitors are seeing, given the fact that maybe they started to see the price erosion impact themselves sooner, I can't really comment on. But certainly, as we talked about, I do feel like we're definitely seeing more now.And I do think we did a good job, especially in the second half of last year, kind of optimizing things, given we were constrained, but that's no longer the case at this point.Alex Henderson -- Needham & Co.Alright. On a separate subject, I know you guys don't want to quantify the 3D sensing, but I think you've talked about capacity at the existing plant being up in the 20 million plus range. It sounds like you're running at less than half capacity here in -- may be in the January quarter, but at least in the April quarter. Is that the right way to think about that sort of generic ballpark of where you're running here?Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. I think, Alex, you are right. We don't really want to go through the numbers and we haven't broken those out historically. I think your capacity estimate is close to accurate.I'd say, based on where we are with customer demand and based on where we are in the yield curve, I think you could see us much as maybe 25 million of capacity out of the Allen facility. But I generally I'd say, 20 million to 25 million is kind of the right range.Alex Henderson -- Needham & Co.OK. So are we absorbing significant amount of costs because of underutilization of that facility? Is that part of the gross margin pressure? And if so, how much of a pressure does that represent?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentWell, again, I think I would say two things. First of all, this industry has or some of the applications where the 3D sensing VCSELs go to tend to have some sort of seasonality to it. And so I think you are starting to see and our competitors are seeing some of that seasonality as it comes to a revenue perspective. I think that being said, we are -- or continue to build some volume to get ready for what we hope is increased demand, driven by product cycles in the second half of the year.But you're right, I think we are not producing as much as we are capable of, and part of that is yield and part of that is obviously, the demand isn't at where we would like it to be. But we do still feel very bullish about our position in this industry and our customer interactions and do feel bullish about what will happen in the second half of the year.Alex Henderson -- Needham & Co.Is it reasonable to think that if you are anticipating a very strong demand in say the October, January quarters, that you might build $30 million or $40 million, $50 million worth of inventory in anticipation of that during the lull period? Or is it unlikely that you would want to do that, take that risk on?Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerAgain, I don't want to quantify. But certainly, I think that the expectation would be that we would be able to build ahead. So certainly, our plan is that we are going to load the fab up as much as we can, as Kurt said, ""taking yield and customer demand profile into account."" But I certainly think that you can expect us to build ahead as appropriate.Alex Henderson -- Needham & Co.That's helpful. One last question and I'll cede the floor. A lot of discussions about CWDM4 undermining LR. You guys don't usually talk about the things in the context of the distance parameters.But could you talk a little bit about your exposure within the LR space? As clearly there's an extension of CWDM4 past the 2- kilometer range into the 10-plus range, which is undermining the higher price points of the traditional LR market?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentWell, I think what I really want to say is what we said last quarter is, you're definitely seeing on kind of an overall basis the shift from LR4 to CWDM4 and the variance -- the various variance of CWDM4. So I would say that trend continues, we talked about how margins were less than expected, one of the reasons why was an unfavorable product mix, and we certainly saw meaningfully less LR4 revenue this quarter and significant growth in CWDM4. But I'm not going to get into all the different variants of each of those products. But the trend, you are correct, the trend is continuing where there's more CWDM4 and that's growing where we saw last quarter, at least less LR4.Operator[Operator's Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Doug Clark with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.Doug Clark -- Goldman SachsHi, thanks for taking my question. Michael, welcome. First one is piggybacking off of that inventory comment. Kurt, inventories continue to climb in the balance sheet.I'm wondering if that is directly attributable to 3D sensing, other products as well? And just how you think about inventory management broadly?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYes. Inventory is much higher than we would likely it to be. Honestly, our inventory turns were not where we would like them to be. I don't think that -- I don't think I could -- some that obviously, is attributable to our Allen facility, but it's broader than that.I think a lot of it has to do with some of the product transitions that are going on as well. So as you see, certain products continue to grow strongly like CWDM4, but you've got other products like CFP or CFP2 ethernet that are dropping off faster than expected. And so there is a bit of an inventory hangover that we have, and I think that's going to take multiple quarters to work through. And it's going to be highly dependent on getting revenue growing again and, hopefully, growing with the products that we have the inventory for.So we're working hard on that issue. It's not where we would like it to be. But at the same time, I think operations is one of our strong suits and so I'm sure we will work through this inventory overhang.Doug Clark -- Goldman SachsOK, that's helpful. And then 2-part question on VCSELs and 3D sensing. There was a quote or comment from a member of the Finisar team talking about the Sherman facility being production ready in October. I'm curious if that is initial volumes, full production? Or if you could just give a little bit of an updated timeline three months after last quarter of where you think Sherman will be and when it will be fully available? And then also you mentioned $55 million in related CAPEX in the April quarter, can you give us any sense for how long and how high CAPEX will be on a that Sherman facility over the next several quarters?Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerDoug, let me take the first part of the question. I think that it's certainly we said before that our intention is to have the Sherman facility online in the second half of the year. Our target is sometime in the fall, I think that's a reasonable expectation. And -- but I think a lot depends on -- again, our ability to ramp things are certainly some unknowns between now and then.So our goal is to have it online in that time frame and it remains to be seen, whether we can do it. We're charging as hard as we can to that date. I'll let Kurt handle the second part of the question.Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYes. So in terms of the building and the building uplift and kind of what I'd say is the first phase of capacity expansion in Sherman, I think our total, we estimate it to be about $150 million. So approximately $50 million of which is the building, which we bought this past quarter, plus the uplift of the building. And then the rest is equipment.We spent $20 million last quarter as I mentioned, expect to spend about $55 million this quarter. I'd say probably another $55 million the next quarter and the remainder of the following quarter. But the exact timing obviously, is a little hard to predict. But it's $150 million -- is our best estimate at this time for this initial phase.Doug Clark -- Goldman SachsOK. Great. Thanks for the detail, guys.OperatorYour next question comes from a line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open.Simon Leopold -- Raymond JamesRight. Michael, welcome to the team. . I wanted to start up by getting an update on your view on the annual price negotiations? We generally talk about the sector range of annual decreases of 10% to 15%. Could you let us know how the negotiations played out for you?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentSure. And again for clarification, you're talking about the annual telecom price negotiations. And I think as we said on the last call, it was at the higher end of the 10% to 15% range, not that surprising, given the demand environment on the telecom side right now. But absolutely, it's kind of closer to that higher end of the range.But there's always -- it's highly dependent on product and highly dependent on customer.Simon Leopold -- Raymond JamesAnd could you update us on your thoughts on the China market? How material was China demand in the quarter you just reported? And what are your current expectations for order improvement coming from the Chinese market?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentSo China was -- our Chinese OEMs were down a little bit last quarter. And I would say our outlook is still uncertain there. I think as Michael mentioned, we do expect to see toward to the kind of the second halfa pickup on the WSS side as it relates to domestic deployments and WSS. But I still think, things remain uncertain, as usual, anything related to China.Simon Leopold -- Raymond JamesBecause I think on the last call, I believe Jerry suggested that China might not recover until calendar '19. Some of your peers have suggested a second half calendar '18 improvement. I want to get a better understanding why your view might be different than theirs.Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. I mean, it's hard to comment on what other people are saying. But I think in general, our environment is uncertain as it's been. And so I think it's hard for anybody to call what's going on in China.China's extremely tough as you know. And our best visibility is around the WSS product where we're seeing some strength, but generally, the picture remains uncertain.Simon Leopold -- Raymond JamesAnd one last one, I'd like to check in on where you are in terms of the direct web scale sales. I think you had a pretty decent percent. If I recall, roughly 15% of sales into that vertical last quarter. I wanted to check in to see how that was going in the current quarter and your outlook?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentSure. So I do think -- it depends obviously if you're talking about percent of datacom versus percent of overall revenue. But I do think as we kind of bucketized this typically on the datacom side, it's well north of 20% of our revenue is on the Web 2.0 side, if you want to call it that. I think as you look into calendar '18, we surely expect that business from a unit perspective to continue to grow.And I think the question just becomes what is the pricing environment like and how much does that offset the unit growth? So I think there's still some uncertainty there about that. But obviously, from a unit perspective, that's a very still very much a growing business. And I think what we're trying to do is expand that customer's set. So obviously, it's been concentrated for a while under a handful of players that everybody can name.But you're starting to see additional players or opportunities as it relates to Web 2.0 that we are pursuing.Simon Leopold -- Raymond JamesGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. We'll see you next week.OperatorYour next question comes from the line from Mike Genovese with MKM partners. Your line is open.Michael Genovese -- MKM PartnersYeah, thanks very much. I think last quarter, you guys said that between Allen and Sherman, if you look out some number of quarters into the future, it should be about $100 million in capacity for 3D sensing per quarter. Is that still a good number? When we expect to get there? And when do we think demand will require that much for a quarter?Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, let me try to address that. I mean, I think the whole operation sort of comes in multiple phases. I would say, as we initially bring Sherman on, I wouldn't expect more than $50 million to $60 million of revenue capacity out of the Sherman facility. I think we can certainly in the first phase build Sherman to a capacity of $80 million plus.But I don't think, at least in that initial phase, I don't think $100 million is the right number. I think in the asymptote as we go out some distance in time and build on some multiple phases, I think then you can see the $100 million. But certainly, in the initial phase, I wouldn't think about $100 million being a right numberMichael Genovese -- MKM PartnersDo you have anything to share on demand trends? I mean, obviously, seasonality right now things are looking good for that product. But if we go out into the strong part of the cycle for the next build from the customer, hiring some to meet demand then?Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. I think, again, it's hard to comment on the overall business. But I think as we look at the 3D sensing business, as Kurt said, in the back half of the calendar year, we certainly expect a significant pickup in demand and shipments. I think a reasonable expectation is that the first part of the cycles will be shipping out of the Allen facility, and then we'll be looking to transition to Sherman as soon as possible.Michael Genovese -- MKM PartnersJust a couple more from me. First, do you have any recent qualifications for ROADM WSS either with U.S. customers or Chinese customers recently to report?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYes. So the update there is that we don't have any recent stuff as it relates to the line card. We've actually decided to stop some of our line card development activities recently, just given the fact that it's taken -- took this longer to try to get qualified than expected and the key customer already had two sources. So the answer is we don't have any new line card activities or WSS activities to report on.Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. Mike, I would say just to add, follow up on what Kurt said, I think in general per my initial remarks, I think line cards is an area that we're taking specific attention to. As Kurt said, we have made decisions to stop some activity there. We'll be reviewing all of that as we go forward and seeing how we could best fit into that customer set.Michael Genovese -- MKM PartnersGreat. OK. Last question from me, just -- if we just assume or -- hypothetically, if overall demand in China, they were clearly building a lot more networks, metro, provincial, et cetera, and clearly the demand environment in China would strengthen, which is obviously, hypothetical at this point, what specific products would you be participating in and would you expect to turn out for you? I mean, I'm sure you're going to say ROADM, but is there anything else besides that, that you would expect to get stronger if the Chinese demand turned up?Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, I mean, I think we obviously, play with the Chinese OEMs across the portfolio, and I think our relationships with the key customers has been strong. We've obviously, as Kurt talked to, we've historically -- as the run-up happened in 2017, we saw a tremendous amount of benefit, I think again the hypothetical is that market rationalizes and heats up, we would expect to see good share there and given our relationships across the customer set, I think we would fair well.Michael Genovese -- MKM PartnersThanks very much.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.Mark Kelleher -- D.A DavidsonGreat. Thanks for taking the questions. Michael, let me extend my welcome as well. In the past, you've indicated, you've given us some general insight into the QSFP28 revenue growth, may be sequential or year-over-year.Is there any more insight. You can give into that level of growth?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentI think what we said last quarter was that in our fiscal Q2, we have done something in the ballpark of $100 million that quarter and that we expected to grow approximately in the $15 million range in this quarter. And I'd say, we're approximate -- we lived up to the expectations there. I think as we look forward to Q4, as I mentioned, we expect unit growth to continue. But given some of the price erosion that we're seeing, whether or not that leads to revenue growth, is to be determined.Mark Kelleher -- D.A DavidsonOK, great. That's great insight. Is there an ability as the market shifts to CWDM4, is there ability within your manufacturing process to help the gross margins? Can you squeeze improved gross margins out of improved facility, manufacturing?Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerI would say this that on CWDM4, we have a number of different products in the pipeline that held the costs. It's obviously, a key focus because as Kurt said, it's something that we see being important not just now but in the future quarters. So from a development standpoint costs is a huge focus, and we're certainly working on cost reductions on the basic product. To your point always the manufacturing cost is the focus and squeezing every penny we can out of the factories is a key issue.So I would expect to see improvement on both vectors.Mark Kelleher -- D.A DavidsonOK. Great. That's all I have. Thanks.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of James Kisner with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.James Kisner -- JefferiesWelcome, Michael. So I just wanted to talk about 40-gig and 10-gig for a second. So you've given us a lot of help on 100-gig and you pointed the 40-gig being weak. And actually, it was different than one of your data-center-focused competitors saw, but, I mean, it sounded like -- it seemed to you like 40-gig is now kind of rolling over, should we expect it to kind of rapidly decline? Or is it kind of basing here at the current level, I sort of seeing pressure on 10-gig? I'm just also kind of wondering if indeed this will sort of keep rolling off, I mean, are you confident that datacom is going to be growing sequentially through the year or at least directionally driven by the ramp of CWM4?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYes. I'd say, first of all, I am not exactly sure what competitor you're talking about. But I think our Q2 40- gig was actually pretty healthy relative to some of our competitors. So maybe they had a bit of a bounce.But 40-gig was definitely down this quarter, and we expect it to continue to be down over time. We've always said as supply and demand reached equilibrium for 100-gig QSFP28, that we'd expect 40-gig to start to fall off. And I think it's falling off as we expected when we reached equilibrium. So it's definitely one of the reasons as we listed earlier that we're going to see a revenue decline, expect to see a revenue decline this quarter.James Kisner -- JefferiesWhat's happening with 10-gig? Is that more stable with enterprise buying? Or what is that look like?Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive Officer10-gig has stabilized some, I'd say it's -- So I think it's relatively flat last quarter. I think it will be flat to maybe slightly down this quarter. But it's definitely stabilized versus we saw pretty severe, I'd say 10-gig degradation at the beginning of calendar '17. And I think that was part of which, as Jerry said a couple of quarters ago, was related to some of the Web 2.0s that we're still using some 10-gig that we're moving off of it.But I'd say for kind of the enterprise as you call it, it's stable, where you expect, of course, 10- gig to decline over time just like all legacy products, too, and, ultimately, for people to deploy the newer products. But it's been more stable lately.James Kisner -- JefferiesOK. And just related here, just to go back to LR4 for QSFP28. I mean, it seems like there's definitely headwinds on LR4. I'm wondering is that going to keep going down, going forward as well, so you're pretty much in datacom? But other than X3 Sensing pretty much relying on CWM4 to kind of carry the ball for you completely? Or is LR4 kind of stabilizing? Can you put a finer point on LR4s?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentWell, certainly, CWDM is the growth engine. And as we said, we expect the units of that to continue to grow and be the big growth engine for the webscale and the hyperscale guys. I think in terms of when does LR4 reach some sort of asymptote, I'm not ready to predict that yet. So we certainly in the last couple of quarters have seen decline in LR4.And I expect some further declines this quarter. But there's definitely a market for LR4. But certainly, all the growth that we're seeing is on CWDM4 side.James Kisner -- JefferiesOK. Just last one, it seems that you don't have that much China exposure anymore, except with maybe ROADMs ramping here at some point. But there have been comments from China, I think every companies have been asking this during earnings season about the comments on them called the bidding domestic industry -- component industry. And I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that as you're planning your strategy and thinking about the impact in your business?Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. I mean, I think the goal for us is to stay ahead. I think the Chinese if they end up coming in any meaningful way historically in almost any business, it's been on the trailing edge and optimizing around cost. I think our forte has been being at the leading edge and being out in front relative to new standards, and new speeds.And so that's where we want to be. I think even in the face of increased Chinese competition if, in fact, materializes, I think we'll be in pretty good shape.Operator[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Tim Savageaux with Northland Securities. Your line is open.Tim Savageaux -- Northland SecuritiesHi, good afternoon. Couple of questions from me. I wanted to go back to comments on capacity in Sherman. Was that $50 million to $60 million, is that Sherman only or Sherman plus Allen as Sherman begins to ramp? Just to clarify that.Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerI think the key to understand is that we -- at some point, and that point is not yet clear, our intention is to consolidate Sherman and Allen. I think the number that I just related, the $50 million to $60 million, would be the Sherman number, but I think to think about your models, I don't think that we're going to run simultaneously for very long in Sherman and Allen.Tim Savageaux -- Northland SecuritiesUnderstood. So we should think about that as kind of a total capacity type number. As you look at the demand side of the equation, Michael, given your background and successfully supplying both the Android and iOS side of the house. I'm wondering if you have any commentary on what you're seeing from a demand standpoint on the Android side? And whether that figures into your capacity planning and idea of the served market opportunity out there?Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. I think we're early yet with the Android customers. I mean, certainly, everybody is talking about 3D sensing, and I think the world of opportunity is significant. We are working on a variety of technologies and to be able to go serve different customers.And given our engagement so far, I'm optimistic that we're going to see volume both from additional phone manufacturers as well as from segments like automotive. So we're continuing to make progress in the customer base and developing technologies I think that will be a good marriage between their needs and what we could produce.Tim Savageaux -- Northland SecuritiesOK. And to finish up on 3D and I do want to follow up. I mean, would you say as you kind of join the company and assess the situation that ramping Sherman would be your no.1 priority as CEO of Finisar at this point in time?Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerWe've got a lot of priorities, there's no question. I think there's a great number of opportunities. I think our 3D sensing opportunity is certainly something that we're going to focus on. I'd say, in general, it's a great opportunity as I said both for what we have on our plates and what we expect to add.So that is a very big focus of the company and of mine.Tim Savageaux -- Northland SecuritiesGot it. And just to follow up on the numbers a little bit. As you guide to Q4 talking about roughly $20 million, $22 million sequential decline, Kurt, I think you called out three drivers there or Michael, maybe you did, 3D sensing, 40-gig, in telecom, I wonder if you might be able to wait those drivers with regard to their contribution to that sequential decline? Should we think of those as being about equal or some...Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentI would say, they are in the same ballpark, but I would say there are also probably ordered sequentially. So I think probably the first would be on the VCSEL side and the second would be 40-gig and the third would be telecom. But they're all roughly in the same ballpark, I'd say.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Richard Shannon with Craig Hallum. Your line is open.Richard Shannon -- Craig-HallumThanks for taking my question. Maybe I'll focus on the 3D sensing topic, Michael, and you're -- the last responses that you're talking about 3D sensing outside of the mobile space you mentioned automotive. Maybe I'll ask it just more broadly non-mobile there, what kind of opportunities in terms of size and timing do you see that happening for you and for the industry?Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. I think it's hard to size because I think everybody's looking at it generically right now. I think if you look at automotive in specific, I think you're looking at really 2020 before you'd see anything of any significance in that space. It's still hard to size because we just don't know what models people are thinking about and how deeply they adopt it in the portfolio.On the Android phone side, again, I think it's a little bit hard to say when those start kicking in. I think it will certainly be earlier than automotive. But the size is again hard to say because the depth of and of the model stock into which the 3D sensing appears is still a little bit of a question.Richard Shannon -- Craig-HallumOK, that makes sense. Follow-up question from me on gross margins. Kurt, historically, you've had a gap between your datacom and your telecom product lines as you've defined them. You talked about some significant pricing pressure in the datacom side and really this question excludes the impact of 3D sensing.How much have those gross margins contracted over the last couple of quarters or Android going forward, you see those two numbers coming closer together?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentWell, I guess what I would say is, first of all, I do think it's highly dependent on customer and product mix, right? So inside of telecom, you've got plenty of products that are above our corporate average, plenty below, same thing on the datacom side. And there has not been a huge gap, I'd say between datacom and telecom on average. But if you look at our business, it's 80% datacom, I think, the last quarter. So I think you can look at roughly our overall -- what happened to our overall gross margins and kind of extrapolate what's happening on the datacom side.But there isn't -- on an aggregated basis, there isn't a huge difference between those two at this point.Richard Shannon -- Craig-HallumOK. Fair enough. That's all the questions for me. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Dave Kang with B. Riley, FBR. Your line is open.Dave Kang -- B. Riley FBRThank you. Good afternoon. Just questions on 3D S. First of all, I believe you guys were working on just the larger chip before.Are you trying to work on both larger chip as well as smaller chip?Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. Dave, I think it's hard for us to comment on what we're going to work on from a roadmap perspective. At least as far as I'm aware of, we have not delineated different products out there. But I would say, again, certainly we're -- we are working on variety of different things for customers both in the consumer segment and automotive.But to be more specific than that, I'd be reluctant to talk about that.Dave Kang -- B. Riley FBRWhat about -- you talked about Android customers, but my understanding is that they will be at least some of them prefer edge meters. So do you guys have edge meters? And if not, when do you plan to have edge meters?Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerI think that the environment is uncertain. There's a lot of different technologies that the Android customers are considering, and we're working on all the things that the Android customers are taking a look at. To spin it down specifically to edge meters, I think it would be premature. But certainly, we hope to engage the customers, and we think we have the right technologies to do that.Dave Kang -- B. Riley FBRGot it. And lastly, on just WSS, what's your current run rate right now?Kurt Adzema -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentDave, as you know, we're not going to give out that number. But I think, in general, we've talked about, it's been, unfortunately, it's got a little bit of lumpy, but it's been a relatively flat market for us. So I think that's all about I'm going to say.Dave Kang -- B. Riley FBRGot it. Thank you.OperatorThat is all the time we have. I will now turn the call back over to Michael.Michael Hurlston -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Chantel, and thank you to everybody for joining the call. We certainly appreciate your time and attendance, and we hope you'll have a great day. And we look forward to you joining us again in three months.

"Why Lumber Liquidators Holdings Stock Crashed 11% in January, and Continues to Tank","Feb 13, 2018 at 5:24AM","What happenedAfter a staggering run-up of 99% in 2017, shares of hardware flooring retailer Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL) are finding it hard to keep the momentum going. Lumber Liquidators tumbled 11% in January, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, leaving investors wondering if the stock has lost steam.Lumber Liquidators has already dropped another 9.8% so far this month, as of the time of this writing. What's going on?So what2017 was a transformational year for Lumber Liquidators, as it left behind the ghosts of a scandal that involved its Chinese-made laminate flooring for potential health hazards. The company confirmed that its efforts to salvage any damage to its reputation and sales were paying off when it reported strong profit numbers for its second quarter in August last year, sending the shares soaring 51.9% during the month.By October, Lumber Liquidators reached a settlement of $36 million, partly in cash and partly in the form of store-credit voucher, to settle the class action lawsuits. The stock, however, continued to be volatile as the company reported a surprise loss for its third quarter on Oct. 31, to some extent because of the legal expenses tied to the lawsuits.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Nonetheless, Lumber Liquidators ended 2017 with a hefty 99% gain. Unfortunately, investors don't appear to be confident just yet about management's growth plans, which is why the stock gave up 11% in January despite lack of any company news. Or put another way, investors simply took some profits off the table after the stock's huge rally last year.The drop in Lumber Liquidators stock in February, though, was triggered by another reason: a massive analyst downgrade.Now whatInvestment firm Wedbush just downgraded its rating on Lumber Liquidators stock from outperform to neutral and slashed its price target on the stock to $28. As of this writing, the stock has already tumbled below $25 after the news.Wedbush isn't confident about Lumber Liquidators' prospects, thanks to decelerating sales growth, rising interest rates, and higher promotional costs amid stiff competition, especially from heavyweights like Home Depot that are experiencing strong sales momentum in flooring as they push for chemical-free, greener products.Whether Lumber Liquidators shares can rebound now depends a great deal on what the company has to offer in terms of its outlook for 2018 and beyond later this month when it reports its fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 numbers.It's imperative that management chalks out firm plans to not only grow margins to beat the competition but also regain lost customer confidence after the scandal and increase its store footfalls. Unless investors have better visibility into the flooring specialist's future, the stock could continue to feel the heat."
Dell Technologies Inc (DVMT) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call Transcript,"Mar 8, 2018 at 10:34AM","IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL.Dell Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:DVMT)Q4 2018 Earnings Conference CallMarch 8, 2018, 8:00 a.m. ETContents:Prepared RemarksQuestions and AnswersCall ParticipantsPrepared Remarks:OperatorGood morning and welcome to the Fiscal Year 2018 Fourth-Quarter and Year-End Earnings Conference Call for Dell Technologies, Inc. I'd like to inform all participants that this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies, Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited.As a reminder, the company is also simulcasting this call at investors.delltechnologies.com. A replay of this webcast will be available at the same location for one year. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question and answer session. If you have a question, simply press *1 on your telephone keypad at any time during the presentation. I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin.Rob Williams -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks, Regina. Good morning and thanks for joining us. With me today is our CFO, Tom Sweet, our Vice Chairman of Product and Operations, Jeff Clark, and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. We've posted our fourth-quarter press release and web deck on our website. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective. Full-year fiscal 2018 financial results will be filed on Form 10-K on Thursday, March 29th.I'd like to highlight a few items related to this quarter's results. Beginning in Q4, we now have fully comparable year-over-year quarterly results, so unless otherwise specified, all growth percentages refer to year-over-year change. Please note that Q4 of fiscal 2017 was a 14-week quarter, as compared to this year's 13-week quarter in Q4. Also, note that all financial results reported today are based on our historical revenue standard ASC 605 and do not reflect the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. We intend to hold a separate call for investors in late April to walk through the impact of ASC 606 adoption and provide restated financial information.10 stocks we like better than Dell Technologies Inc. Class VWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Dell Technologies Inc. Class V wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.See the 10 stocks*Stock Advisor returns as of April 2, 2018During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA on a continuing operations basis. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the supplemental material in our web deck and the tables accompanying our press release.Our Q4 non-GAAP operating income excludes approximately $2.4 billion of adjustments, and our full-year non-GAAP operating income excludes approximately $10.2 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are non-cash and related to purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. There will continue to be significant bridging items between our GAAP and our non-GAAP results for the next few years, although the impact will decline in each subsequent quarter. Please refer to Slide 3 in the web deck for additional detail on the non-GAAP non-cash adjustments and the supplemental slides beginning on Slide 21 for more details on our total non-GAAP adjustments.I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in the Cautionary Statement section in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.Finally, before I turn it over to Tom, I want to address the amended 13D we filed on February 2nd, disclosing that the Dell Technologies Board of Directors is evaluating a number of potential business opportunities. This is part of our ongoing multiyear strategic planning, and we are doing this from a position of strength. We are leaders in 21 of the top market share categories and we have leadership in 13 Gartner Magic Quadrant reports. As Tom will discuss in his remarks, we are in solid financial condition with strong cash flow generation and we have made significant progress on paying down debt. With that said, we will not address the filing any further or take questions related to this topic. Now, I'll turn it over to Tom.Tom Sweet -- Chief Financial OfficerThanks, Rob. I was pleased with our results for fiscal 2018, as we have made significant progress in a number of areas. We drove strong top-line velocity, delivering revenue of $80 billion for the year, and we saw revenue and profit momentum improve as we moved through the year, all while navigating through one of the toughest component cost environments we've seen. We delivered strong operating cash flow of $6.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $8.2 billion, allowing us to make good progress on delevering paying down $10 billion of gross debt since the closing of the EMC transaction.The teams did a good job on integration and we're seeing strong coordination across the entire Dell Technologies family. This collaboration is paying off with better-than-expected revenue synergies and strong customer acceptance of our broad solutions portfolio. We increased our global coverage by investing significantly in our sales team and channel program and we've made changes in the Infrastructure Solutions group that Jeff will discuss in more detail.Now, let me turn to our results for the fourth quarter. GAAP revenue for the quarter was $21.9 billion with a GAAP operating loss of approximately $320 million. Non-GAAP revenue was up 8% to $22.2 billion with strong top-line velocity for client, servers, and VMware, along with improving demand for storage. Gross margin was $7 billion, up 6%, and was 31.6% of revenue, which was down 40 basis points driven by mix dynamics within ISG, given the strength we've seen in servers. OpEx was $4.9 billion, up 3%, and was 22.1% of revenue, which was down 100 basis points as we continue to drive OpEx discipline across the business even as we selectively invest in growth opportunities.Operating income was up 15% to $2.1 billion, or 9.5% of revenue, up 50 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 13% to $2.5 billion, or 11.1% of revenue. Please see Slide 22 in the web deck for more details on our EBITDA adjustments. Deferred revenue was $22.2 billion, up $3.6 billion year over year and up $2.2 billion sequentially, driven by growth in maintenance, flexible consumption models, and extended warranty. Specific to flexible consumption models, we continue to respond to customers' requests for choice in how they procure and utilize our solutions. Though the revenue and margin are not immediately recognized, these arrangements will provide a more predictable long-term recurring revenue and profit stream.Before I jump into segment results, let me make a couple of additional comments. First, as we've seen in prior years, Q1 is typically down sequentially given the seasonal patterns of the business. We also see a use of cash in the first quarter given historical seasonal patterns. Looking at historical trends, we then build momentum through the remainder of the year. Second, I also wanted to touch on tax reform. As you know, a comprehensive tax reform was passed in December. We view tax reform as a positive for the overall U.S. economy and IT spending. Due to the complex nature of the tax reform bill, it requires extensive tax analysis, and the government continues to issue guidance and clarifications. Today, I will provide our estimates of the impact that are based on our current analysis of the new tax rules.During the fourth quarter, we recorded a benefit of $316 million for the net impact of tax reform, driven by a benefit of $1.3 billion related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, offset in part by current and future income tax expenses of approximately $1 billion related to the transition tax. The cash tax impact of the repatriation toll charge will be substantially offset by other tax attributes. Going forward, we continue to evaluate the impact of tax reform on our effective tax rate. Given what we know today, our expectation is that tax reform will not materially change our effective tax rate, as the positive impacts should offset the negative impacts when fully interpreted and implemented.Now, let me give you a summary view of the financial performance of our business segments for the fourth quarter. Revenue for our infrastructure solutions group was $8.8 billion, up 5%. The revenue increase was primarily driven by servers and networking, which were up 27% to $4.6 billion. Servers delivered its third consecutive quarter of record revenue, with double-digit growth from both PowerEdge and cloud servers as we continue to see strong demand for PowerEdge servers along with ongoing expansion of our server average selling prices.Storage revenue was $4.2 billion and was down 11%, but for the first time since the transaction closed, storage demand grew year over year. One of the drivers behind the variance between demand and reported results is due to deferred revenue, primarily related to maintenance and our flexible consumption models. We are encouraged that we exited the quarter with better storage velocity on a demand basis and we expect a gradual recovery over the coming quarters as the actions and investments we put in place this year gain tractions.Operating income for ISG was $748 million, or 8.5% of revenue, which is a 350-basis-point decline over the prior year, primarily due to a higher mix of servers, and to a lesser extent, higher component cost. We are focused on improving the overall profitability of the business, balancing velocity and profitability in servers while growing storage and data protection. Revenue for our Client Solutions group was $10.6 billion, up 8%, driven by higher average selling prices across both commercial and consumer, and double-digit growth in client software and peripherals. Commercial revenue grew 9% due to average selling price expansion for notebooks and workstations, as well as double-digit revenue growth in displays. Consumer revenue was up 6%, driven by growth in average selling prices for both notebooks and XPS products.CSG operating income was up 70% to $581 million, which was 5.5% of revenue. The team did a good job of offsetting component cost headwinds through repricing and also focused on attaching higher-margin services in S&P. VMware had another strong quarter. Revenue for the VMware segment was up 20% to $2.3 billion and operating income was $834 million, or 35.8% of revenue. Revenue from our other businesses, which includes SecureWorks, RSA, Pivotal, and Boomi, was $492 million, which was up 3%.Now, turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation, we had strong cash flow generation in Q4 as cash from operations was $3.1 billion, predominantly due to improved overall profitability and the seasonal increase in maintenance and services contracts, which are paid up front. Our cash and investments balance was $20.3 billion, up approximately $2.3 billion versus the prior quarter.On the debt side, since closing the transaction, we've paid down $10 billion of gross debt -- excluding DFS debt -- and remain fully committed to delevering the balance sheet.During Q4, we paid down approximately $300 million in debt, ending the quarter with $52.7 billion in total debt. Total debt is $200 million higher than the prior quarter due to an increase of approximately $450 million in DFS debt. Core debt ended the quarter at $39.9 billion, down from $48.8 billion at the time we closed the EMC transaction. As a reminder, core debt excludes DFS-related debt, unrestricted subsidiary debt, and the margin loan, and is aligned with how we present the capital structure to the rating agencies for leverage discussions. For additional detail on what is included or excluded in our debt balances, please see Slide 9 of the web deck.Demand for financial services is strong across the Dell Technologies family. In Q4, DFS originations were approximately $1.9 billion, up 23%. As of the end of fiscal 2018, financing receivables now stand at $7.6 billion, up 30%. As we've discussed on prior calls, the growth in financing receivables drives an increase in our DFS debt as we continue to fund the business. Now, let me turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the operational highlights of CSG and ISG.Jeff Clarke -- Vice Chairman, Product and OperationsThanks, Tom. We ended the year on a high note with improved performance across the business in the fourth quarter. Client, servers, hyper-converged infrastructure, and our all-flash products continued the strong growth trajectory we've seen in prior quarters and we saw improvement in the traditional storage demand as we exited the year.Since we last spoke in December, we've already made changes that set us up for success moving forward. We simplified the ISG organization, aligning leaders and product categories more effectively for improved speed and accountability. We've already started to simplify our product offerings and how we go to market. For example, we will be aligning our software-defined storage strategy division, offering VxRail and VxRack SDDC. We started shipping the enhanced mid-range storage products we announced in November and expanded the Future-Proof Storage Loyalty Program to all of our storage products shortly after it launched.Lastly, we've increased collaboration across our strategically aligned businesses to leverage our collective strengths and to build better solutions for things like cloud, software-defined storage, software-defined data center, infrastructure as a service, and hyper-converged infrastructures. A simple organization with simpler portfolios and targeted solutions means faster decisions and faster innovations. It also promotes a faster go-to-market engine, benefiting both businesses and our customers.Looking at the full fiscal year 2018 results for ISG and CSG, they were solid overall with a few areas that we are addressing. External feedback has been positive, with a survey conducted by IDC finding that 91% of customers say that Dell and EMC have delivered on our pre-merger promises. It's clear that Dell Technologies' value proposition of leading the digital, IT security, and workforce transformation is resonating with customers, partners, and industry analysts. We recognize that we have some areas that need focus and we're working to improve as we move into FY '19. Let me touch on some of the highlights.For the full year, CSG delivered excellent results, reporting revenue of $39.5 billion, which was up 7%. Operating income of $2.2 billion was up 19% and was 5.6% of revenue. We had a record holiday season in Consumer and the investments we've made in Client are paying off as premium notebooks -- including workstations, Latitudes, and XPS -- all grew double digits in FY '18, and we saw double-digit growth and demand for gaming and Rugged notebooks.We received a record high 87 awards at CES this year, which was our fourth year in a row of setting a record. In calendar Q4, we delivered our 20th straight quarter of year-over-year worldwide PC unit share gains. That said, our growth premium has slowed the past two quarters, so we're focused on driving higher relative unit growth in a consolidating market while maintaining profitability in FY '19.As Tom mentioned, client S&P saw good growth this year, driven by double-digit growth in displays and peripherals, which includes items like docking stations. Dell continues to be the No. 1 display provider in the world and gained 110 basis points of unit share on a year-over-year basis -- based on calendar Q3 -- from displacers.ISG performance was mixed this past year. Revenue for the fiscal year was $30.7 billion and above our expectations while operating income was $2.2 billion, or 7.1% of revenue, which was below our expectations. Servers and networking revenue was $15.4 billion, up 20%. FY '18 was a record year for servers for revenue and units. It was the second time we've shipped 2 million servers in a year.Q4 marked the third consecutive quarter of record revenue, and we continue to see strong unit growth in both PowerEdge and cloud servers. We saw higher ASPs for servers as we continued to see more richly configured servers, we ramped our 14th-generation PowerEdge server, and we've effectively managed pricing to partially mitigate the ongoing memory cost inflation. In Q3, we became the worldwide leader for x86 servers based on both units and revenue, and we finished the calendar year at the No. 1 spot for both categories for x86, according to IDC. This is the first time since we've entered the server market that we've been the undisputed market leader.Moving to storage, revenue was $15.3 billion for the full year. Our market-leading hyper-converged portfolio saw triple-digit demand growth with strengthened VxRail, while demand for our Isilon scale-out NAS and our all-flash arrays grew double digits over the year. Our all-flash business exited the year at a demand rate of nearly $5 billion, and we remain the undisputed leader in all-flash arrays, with nearly one-third of the worldwide revenue market share.As we've discussed on previous calls, traditional storage and data protection were challenged, both in the financial results and market share, and we are laser-focused on improving this business. We've made investments and have implemented action plans over the past few months to improve storage growth, particularly in mid-range, and we expect the benefits of these actions to materialize through the next year.Looking forward, we want to build on the momentum and velocity we've seen while we continue to drive hard against the operational improvements. Our priorities for FY '19 are to continue to deliver world-class quality and service, reduce complexity across the portfolio, accelerate storage and data protection velocity, maintain server velocity while improving profitability, ramp sales productivity -- which will be a multi-quarter journey -- and accelerate client unit velocity with market consolidation while maintaining profitability.The technology and market trends played directly into our hands and we're positioned to win. We have the right strategy, the right team, and an unmatched portfolio to lead our customers on this journey through their digital future. With that, let me turn it back over to Tom.Tom Sweet -- Chief Financial OfficerThanks, Jeff. We made solid progress and leaned into some challenges in fiscal '18. Overall, we feel good about our performance against the four strategic goals we laid out at the April analyst meeting. We made strides to drive client, server, and services velocity and grew at or above market in multiple areas of the business, and the team navigated through some tough component cost headwinds. We generated strong cash flow and successfully delivered working capital efficiencies, allowing us to make great progress on delevering the balance sheet. We are well into the integration efforts, but we still have more work to do related to product positioning and solutions as well as systems and tools. Finally, we brought the full capabilities of Dell Technologies to customers in a more comprehensive and seamless experience, and this is resonating with our customers.As we move forward into fiscal '19, we want to continue to execute our strategy in order to fully embrace the opportunities we see. We believe the macro environment and the IT market are setting up to be stronger as global economic sentiment has improved and GDP expectations have grown. The U.S. tax reform changes have had a positive impact on expectations for capital expenditures, and customers are being driven toward digital transformation, which requires more compute from the edge to the core to the cloud and requires more capacity, storage, data protection, and security, all of which are good for our business. We must improve a few areas of the business to strengthen our position and take advantage of these factors.With that in mind, let me outline our four strategic areas of focus for fiscal '19. The first two haven't changed that much from fiscal '18. We want to continue growing above the market and drive share gains, with particular focus on storage and client, and we have to continue to generate strong cash flows and delever the balance sheet. The third goal is capturing the priorities that Jeff outlined during his remarks. We need to drive profitability in ISG as we balance server velocity and profitability and accelerate storage and data protection velocity. The last goal is to continue to delight customers by listening to and addressing their needs for their digital transformation journey through our full range of capabilities.In closing, we believe we have the right strategy, and given the market trends, we feel good about our position headed into fiscal '19 as we focus on executing the business model and serving our customers. With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.Questions and Answers:Rob Williams -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks, Tom. Let's get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question with one follow-up if you have one. Regina, can you please introduce the first question?OperatorOur first question will come from the line of David Eller with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.David Eller -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystGood morning and thank you for taking the call. Performance was very strong in the CSG segment and I was wondering if there were any one-time items in the operating income. In the past, you've had vendor settlements and things like that that have helped.Tom Sweet -- Chief Financial OfficerNo, there were not. It was just a pure performance-oriented quarter based upon the execution that the team did, principally around pricing and the work that they did to ensure that with the component cost dynamics we had, we were pricing properly and ensuring that we got value for solutions. So, no, in terms of one-offs, not really anything there in the quarter.Jeff Clarke -- Vice Chairman, Product and OperationsDavid, I would add to what Tom said, that good performance in our commercial PCs, good performance in our premium notebooks -- Rugged, XPS, the gaming side, and those -- all bring good margin profiles to our business. We did execute quite well in Q4.Tom Sweet -- Chief Financial OfficerYour attachment mix was better, Jeff, in terms of -- think about displays and some of the services attached.Jeff Clarke -- Vice Chairman, Product and OperationsI was going to say that our display business continued to do quite well, and our accessories business -- particularly around docks -- was an opportunity for us with that notebook performance to drag along more revenue with our attach, attach, attach.David Eller -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystOkay, that's very helpful. And then, you laid out your focus areas for FY 2019 on Slide 18. That was very helpful. But, could you take a step back and just frame your market expectations for each segment for the coming year -- so, the competitive environment, where we are in the cycle for each?Tom Sweet -- Chief Financial OfficerLet me start, and then Jeff can probably give you some more insight. So, as we think about the business for the coming year and the market segments... Look, if you think about PCs, for instance, IDC would say that the market in calendar '18 was roughly a -1.5, -1.7, although commercial would be up marginally. So, pretty much that status quo if you think about what's been going on in the market of late.On the server market -- particularly in the mainstream servers -- IDC says 2.1% growth for next year, which is slightly down from where it ended in the fourth quarter -- or, I guess it's flat with the fourth quarter. In terms of where we are in terms of those cycles -- I'll get to storage in a second -- we feel pretty good about the velocity in the server business right now. There's clearly a -- we believe that the industry dynamics and trends are coming our way around more compute-centered platforms.We also feel really good about where we are with our PC offerings and our commercial client offerings. Jeff mentioned the thin and light -- the gaming capabilities, the XPS products, and the new Latitude lines. And so, we feel like we're pretty well covered there. The market looks relatively stable; the macros look relatively stable, so we'll have to see how that progresses. In the storage market -- maybe Jeff can add some insight there for us -- it's forecasted to be about a flat market, although IDC would say there's growth in the midrange and continued softness on the high end, although not as soft in the high end as it was this year. So, that's clearly an area of focus for us as we position and think our way through how do we drive storage velocity and data protection velocity.Jeff Clarke -- Vice Chairman, Product and OperationsI think you hit all the right points. We would look at PC growth to be in the low negative single digits, consumer more negative, commercial slightly positive, commercial notebooks being the shining spot of the PC business, which we have tremendous focus on. I look at the x86 server business to be in the low single digits of positive growth. The storage market, as Tom said, is roughly flat, so our external storage marketplace is fair. Within that, I think there's clearly the midrange that Tom called out, and also the all-flash growth opportunity, which we are a market leader in that category. And then, the hyper-converged category continues to grow in low double digits.David Eller -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystThank you for taking the question.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Thomas Egan with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.Thomas Egan -- JP Morgan Chase -- Managing DirectorGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm not going to ask anything about your amended 13D, but what I'd like to do is ask you a little bit about prioritization -- how you think about prioritization, where you want your cash flows to go given the status quo. You've got the bulk of the cash is at VMware today. The bulk of the cash from operations is being generated by VMware today.You've got some debt coming due and you've also got the tracking stock, which looks pretty attractive because it's selling at such a discount, and you've probably got some changes in how you have to pay taxes, given some of the changes in the tax laws and repatriation of some of that cash. So, could you just give us a holistic view, Tom, of how you're prioritizing debt being paid down, refining of tracker, paying of taxes, and where you think you're going to be able to get that cash from to do all those things?Tom Sweet -- Chief Financial OfficerHey, Tom. I'm happy to address that. Let me just start with this: As we think about our cash flow from operations, which was roughly $6.8 billion this last year, $3.2 billion of that was VMware, so roughly $3.4 billion was the core Dell and Dell EMC. We don't give guidance, but we do expect that that will continue to expand as we continue to execute on our storage strategy and as we continue to execute on some of the priorities that we laid out in the call.As we think about our priorities, they really haven't changed. It's not just cash flow from operations that has helped us. We've also driven great efficiency off our balance sheet from the working capital initiatives that we've driven. As we think about priorities, it's going to continue to be primarily a delevering priority. So, I don't really think that's a big change in strategy from what we've been doing over the last 18 months or so. I will tell you that as we analyze it today, the tax reform impact from a cash perspective is relatively minimal and very manageable, and so, that -- at the present time -- is not a significant driver or causing us to change or rethink our strategy.So, we have about $8.5 billion of cash and investments that are core Dell or Dell EMC if you exclude the VMware cash and investments. That's more than enough to help us manage our way through current maturities, continue delevering, even as we think about how we drive future cash flows from operations. So, I really think my priorities are relatively unchanged. We're committed to delevering the balance sheet; we're committed to getting back to investment-grade-like metrics. We'll do that over the right period of time even as we invest back into the business. And so, that's sort of our current thinking, and maybe I'll ask Tyler to comment on if he's got any other insights or anything you would add to that, Tyler.Tyler Johnson -- Vice President and TreasurerI think you really set it all, Tom. It's the same thing we've been saying since the beginning following the EMC transaction, that we're going to delever. We've paid down $10 billion. Tom talked about the $8.5 billion that we have on the balance sheet or where we ended the balance sheet in Q4, which is excluding the VMware cash, which puts us in a very healthy position as we go into next year, and with the roughly $4.5 billion that we're planning on paying down. We've talked about that, that we're going to use cash from the balance sheet. We might have to dip into our revolver a little bit, but that would only be for the short term, to manage some gaps in timing. So, there was strong cash flow quarter in Q4. I feel really good with where we ended up. As it relates to tracker, we'll continue to be opportunistic around that, as we have in the past, but deleveraging really continues to be our focus.Thomas Egan -- JP Morgan Chase -- Managing DirectorOkay, thank you. That's helpful. And then, for my follow-up, on storage, the turnaround in demand seems to me to be a pretty important point because it's been a thorn in your side since you've done the EMC deal, and I wondered if you could just give us -- you gave us a little bit of color about some parts of it, but if you're saying that demand is up year over year for the first time, that strikes me as being pretty important. Could you talk a little bit about...just give us a little color on that: What total demand was, how you're measuring demand -- is it dollars? -- and then, what the deferred revenue increase was because obviously, we can't see it in the GAAP revenue. Thanks.Jeff Clarke -- Vice Chairman, Product and OperationsTom and I will probably ham-and-egg this one. Look, it is encouraging when you look at our orders demand in Q4 -- the exit velocity. I would use the word ""encouraging."" We haven't set a trend yet, but we think the hard work that we put in place -- the fact that we've added capacity, that we've improved our product competitiveness, that we've increased the speed in our decisions, the customer loyalty program that we put in place at the very end of last year is beginning to pay dividends, so we're encouraged.You saw the Q4 market share data. We have work to do. It is, without question, something Tom and I have tremendous focus on in the organization to change the performance of our storage business, and again, we exit the fiscal year with a bit of encouragement. We saw good performance in our HCI business, we saw good performance in our all-flash business, and that encourages us to where we think -- again, we have expectations of a better year. We built our plan in FY '19 as a take-share plan, as a growth plan, and we've set the tone in the organization that we are expecting to grow in the external storage business and take share. Tom?Tom Sweet -- Chief Financial OfficerI think that's right, Jeff. The comment around the fact that we set our plan around a take-share plan is consistent with how we generally think about our business in the other lobs, for instance. In some of these markets which are consolidating markets, you have to take share. You have to grow. Jeff has been very focused with his ISG team on how does he position both the product, and the offer, and the selling motion to be aligned to take share.We also have to think about the fact that our selling models are changing a little bit, our types of consumption models are changing a little bit around things like flexible consumption. We're now offering customers more choice in how they contractually work with us, and a lot of them are wanting more flexibility. Typically, when you provide flexibility in some of these contractual arrangements, you end up deferring revenue, and so, we did see really strong growth in our deferred revenue, and that was mostly storage-related as it relates to the ISG side of the business.And so, that's why -- for the first time -- you saw us talk a little bit more around deferred revenue in our talking points. I'd like to sensitize you guys to the fact that the models are changing some. It's not going to happen overnight, and we'll see what the natural framework looks like in terms of how big some of these offerings get, but between flexible consumption models, utility models, service-type models, there are some dynamics out there in the industry -- in the customer environment, I should say -- that are changing. That doesn't get counted in IDC share, but it does count in some of the order demand data that Jeff is talking about.So, let me just finish with -- I'll echo Jeff. We are encouraged. We're not confused about what we have left to do. There's a lot of work left to do. We have work to do ensuring that this instance becomes a trend over time. Jeff's done a lot of work, particularly in the midrange offering. We've got more work to do there. That's a growth area for us that we need to attack and ensure that we're taking our fair share of that marketplace. So, that's the work we have in front of us. It connects back to your first question, which is we're very focused on storage. It's a strong margin profile for us, so it drives good cash, and we need to get it growing and going in the right direction.Jeff Clarke -- Vice Chairman, Product and OperationsI'd add one thing. Tom, I think you'd agree with this, and we talked about it on the last call. As we head into FY '19, we've really honed in the compensation plan for our sales force to focus on storage in FY '19, and I think that is a key difference between our FY '18 performance and what we'll achieve in FY '19.Tom Sweet -- Chief Financial OfficerWe clearly have put more dollars at risk as it relates to the storage bucket, so they need to sell storage to that particular plan.Thomas Egan -- JP Morgan Chase -- Managing DirectorThank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jeff Harlib with Barclays. Please go ahead.Jeff Harlib -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Managing DirectorHi, good morning. I just want to talk about margins as you look into the next fiscal year, some of the puts and takes. The $2 billion cost savings program -- I think you had said that will be done fiscal 2Q. You're also reinvesting, which is somewhat of an offset, and then you have some mix challenges across the business with better servers. And then, on computing, the last two quarters seemed to be trending solidly above your prior margin targets, so maybe just an overall discussion on margin, puts and takes, and outlook.Tom Sweet -- Chief Financial OfficerLet me start, and then I'll let Jeff jump in as well. We obviously don't give guidance around margins, so let me start with that, but as we think about the environment, let me give you a couple of thoughts. First, as we've talked about, fiscal '18 was a pretty tough component-cost environment. I think I'm publicly on record as saying that the absolute swing from FY '17, which was a deflationary environment, to an inflationary environment in FY '18 was roughly about a $2.5 billion swing that we had to go adjust pricing for and somehow navigate our way through.What you saw as you think about our fiscal '18 results from first half to second half is you saw us in the first half dealing with a lot of that inflation plus the go-to-market implementation, and then you saw the business accelerate as we went through the year to the point where we felt reasonably good around some of our exit velocity as we got through Q4. So, as we understand it right now, component cost will not be as big of a headwind as it was last year, and perhaps even a slight tailwind. We'll have to see how that progresses through the year.We think that's helpful from a pricing management perspective. That's a positive from a margin perspective. It's competitive out there from a pricing perspective, so we're always going to be competitive and make sure that we've got the price point set properly. From a mix dynamic, if we go execute our plan, you would think you would see some margin help there from the storage and data protection because that's high-margin product and solutions, so that's a focus area for us as well.Servers is going to be an area that -- we said in our talk track that while we're extraordinarily happy with the velocity of servers, we've got a little bit of work to do around improving some of the gross margin dollar contribution there, and so, that's a focus area for us. Look, as anything, it's about how we go execute this year, so I think margins have an opportunity to be better, but there's work to do to make sure that we go execute around that model. Jeff, I don't know what you would add.Jeff Clarke -- Vice Chairman, Product and OperationsMaybe a couple of points. We'll start with CSG. We're going to try to maintain the profitability that you see while increasing the unit velocity. While we did achieve 20 straight quarters of year-over-year share gain, our unit velocity slowed in the second half of the year, and that's a priority of the organization to pick up the unit velocity while maintaining the same level of profitability. We believe we can do that with our bias toward commercial and our attach motion where we can drag peripherals, services, and financing with each purchase. We have a unique ability to do that. So, I'm encouraged there.I'm also encouraged where we're winning, which -- as I mentioned earlier -- is in some of the premium price bands, the premium categories, Latitude commercial notebooks, Precision workstations, XPS, Rugged notebooks, and our gaming categories. Displays is a great business for us there and we continue to be the market leader, and we are working to expand that position as we head into this fiscal year.On servers, I don't want to slow down. Our mix issue in ISG is not an issue that servers grew too fast. Our mix issue is that we didn't grow storage enough, so we want to continue to grow servers and take advantage of the opportunity to access the new customers that we did not have before, that the benefit of the EMC acquisition has given us access to enterprise customers that we did not grow in, and we want to continue to do that. And then, at the end of the day, I have to drive storage growth. Storage growth will change the fundamental composition of the ISG profitability. In terse terms, I need to sell a lot more 60% gross margin things than we are today, and by doing so, we'll lift the aggregate ISG portfolio. Does that make sense?Jeff Harlib -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Managing DirectorYeah, great. That was very helpful. My follow-up would be on free cash flow. The core Dell free cash flow of about $2 billion was very strong in the quarter, well above what we were modeling. I'm just wondering -- I know there are seasonal benefits -- are there any unusual timing issues with some of these permanent changes you've made in your processes? And then, just to follow up on that, the flexible consumption models and the shift to that -- how do you see them impacting cash flow over the next year or two?Tom Sweet -- Chief Financial OfficerI'll start, and then Tyler can probably answer it more intelligently than I can. Look, there really wasn't -- as we think about free cash flow, other than some of the standard working capital dynamics you get out of a stronger demand and shipment quarter, there really wasn't anything unusual in that, other than -- the one comment I would give you is we were pleased with the deferred revenue growth, and in many respects, that deferred revenue growth drives from -- whether it's prepaid maintenance or some of the flexible consumption models, it drives cash up front, but it all comes down to...When we drive velocity through the business model, whether that's through PC servers, and as we continue to build velocity in storage, we get the effects of a very effective and efficient use of working capital. So, nothing unusual other than deferred revenue as it relates to flexible consumption models. Look, we're going to -- it's a careful balance because we like the flexible consumption models in the context of -- they're typically multiyear arrangements, they typically build a better, stronger, and deeper customer relationship, they're generally quite profitable over time. They obviously have some short-term P&L dynamics as you work your way through that, even -- in some instances, particularly with our licensing arrangements, where we get the cash up front.Utility models are something different where we get the cash on a subscription basis per se over time. So, they're going to continue to grow. In many respects, we want them to grow, we just want to make sure we have the right balance in terms of the mix of our business to properly manage both our cash, our P&L commitments, and our relationship with our customers. We also have some new and emerging businesses that are continuing to grow quite fast. Think about a Pivotal, a Boomi, an RSA where -- their business models in many respects are subscription-based models, so we'll continue to see some elements of deferred revenue growth coming from some of those new and emerging businesses. Tyler, would you add anything to that?Tyler Johnson -- Vice President and TreasurerI think you've covered it. The only thing I would add -- and, Jeff, maybe just kind of reinforcing and agreeing with what you said -- depending on how you calculate your free cash flow, when you take into account that we had a $600 million impact from growth in our financing receivables, we paid out approximately $900 million of interest expense. It was a really strong Q4, so we're really happy about where we ended up.Jeff Harlib -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Managing DirectorThank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Karl Keirstead -- Deutsche Bank -- Managing DirectorThanks very much. So, if this question pushes too close to your 13D filing, I'll understand, but I wanted to ask you in general how you view the protection of DVMT shareholder rights. How important is it to Dell to treat this constituency fairly beyond any current business combination review, just in general? Thank you.Tom Sweet -- Chief Financial OfficerKarl, we'll have to defer on that question. If you want to take another question not related to the amended 13D, we'd be happy to take it.Karl Keirstead -- Deutsche Bank -- Managing DirectorGot it. Okay. I will follow up with one financial question. We are in a rising interest rate environment. I don't think your financial results necessarily disclose interest expense, but maybe you could just offer a little bit of context around the portion of debt that's variable, and if there's any color you can offer in terms of exposure to rising interest rates, maybe there's a rule of thumb that might help us on the modeling front. It's much appreciated.Tyler Johnson -- Vice President and TreasurerWe look at our capital structure from a broad perspective, so I actually do have a target around floating-rate debt. Floating-rate debt over time actually outperforms fixed-rate debt, and our floating-rate debt now is roughly about 27%. If you go back and look at what we've been paying down since the close of the transaction, it really has been floating-rate. I'd probably target somewhere between 25% to 40% floating, so we're actually at the lower end of that range, so I feel very comfortable about that position.And yes, even though LIBOR is higher and that piece of interest expense is higher, if you take into account the debt that we've paid down, the repricings that we've gone through, we've more than compensated. So, our actual overall annualized interest expense is lower than where we closed the deal, and that will continue to be driven down. Once again, we're looking forward to this year to paying down $4.5 billion to $5 billion, so we'll continue to take interest expense out of the balance sheet.Karl Keirstead -- Deutsche Bank -- Managing DirectorGreat. Thank you so much.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Frank Jarman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Frank Jarman -- Goldman Sachs -- Managing DirectorGreat, thanks for taking my questions, guys. I just wanted to focus again on the revenue growth, and specifically, the ASPs. I think you said they were higher, but can you give us any more granularity, specifically maybe in how to think about storage versus servers versus PCs, and really, what the component is related to the higher component costs with regard to how you guys are passing that on versus what you're seeing more broadly across the business as well? Thank you.Tom Sweet -- Chief Financial OfficerLet me start, and Jeff can add some comments. Look, we did talk about the fact that some amount of the revenue growth was driven from ASP or TRU expansion, and principally, that's a result -- as you know -- particularly in PCs and servers, we had a higher input cost in terms of the component cost environment. We generally try to price our way through that to ensure that we cover it all.Also, while I won't give you exact percentages, I want to echo what Jeff said around as we think about our revenue velocity in PCs and servers in particular, while we're overall very pleased with it, we are careful as we think our way through how much was ASP-driven versus how much was unit-driven. And so, for instance, in servers, revenue growth was roughly about 22%. If you think about the unit shipments, over half of that revenue growth was driven by TRU expansion versus units, and that's what we want to think our way through in terms of how we balance that, and PCs are much the same. If you think about our PC business being up 7% from a revenue basis and units being up roughly 2% to 3% or something like that...We know that we've got ASP expansion there. The question is can you hold onto it as the component costs change, and that'll be a function of the competitive environment as we go forward. So, it's a dynamic we watch pretty carefully. ASPs within the storage business is a different thought process. We don't think about it like that because the configurations are so different on the offerings and the software that's embedded in it. ASPs are a little less -- we don't think about velocity in the same way as it relates to ASPs in the storage business. Jeff, have I missed anything, or would you highlight anything?Jeff Clarke -- Vice Chairman, Product and OperationsI would add -- if you start with the CSG business -- the dynamics of our revenue growth are a combination of -- you hit them. Pricing efficiency, mix, exposure to commercial, exposure to notebooks, exposure to premium notebooks. So, mix helps us as well as our attach motion of attaching more financing, services, and peripherals to each opportunity. So, that helps us on the CSG side. I think that's sustainable.On the server side, we are in the longest protracted DRAM price increase that we've seen in the last 25 years. Combine that with the fact that we're putting more DRAM in a server today than we were last quarter, than we were a year ago, and you have a compounding effect. So, that has been part of our revenue increase on the server side. For me, it's encouraging that the average amount of DRAM going in our servers and the average SSD size going in our servers is increasing. It tells me we are selling higher in the enterprise workload. We are selling more higher-value solutions inside our customers, penetrating deeper configurations than we had in the past, and I believe that is sustainable in time. Does that help?Frank Jarman -- Goldman Sachs -- Managing DirectorYeah, that's great. Thank you. And then, a second follow-up on the tax comments that you made earlier in the call. So, I think you said a net impact of about $300 million, which was a function of $1.3 billion of benefits related to the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities, offset by $1 billion of a future transition tax. How should I think about that future transition tax? 1). Is that specifically related to the repatriation provisions, and 2). Is there any granularity you can give us with regard to thinking about it on the Dell EMC side versus the VMware side?Tom Sweet -- Chief Financial OfficerLet me try and give you some thoughts around that. Let me first start and say look, we're obviously big supporters of tax reform. The move to territorial is good for the economy. We're reasonably optimistic that some of the immediate expensing around the CapEx will have a helpful impact on our business as we go through the year. So, as we thought about the -- but, it's obviously a very complex calculation, and as we thought about the piece parts, the $1 billion of transition tax is how we think about the overall impact to the Dell Technologies family. Some of that is clearly coming out of VMware, but I'm not going to parse it for you per se.We think it's very manageable in the sense of the cash impact of that. We think it's going to be substantially less from some NOL positions that we have. Look, I think it's very manageable. I think we're continuing to evaluate it because the environment and the regulatory guidance continues to get issued, but I'm reasonably optimistic around the go-forward positions and the go-forward syntax as we do the tax work.Frank Jarman -- Goldman Sachs -- Managing DirectorGreat. Thanks so much, guys.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jason Kilgariff with Bank of America. Please go ahead.Jason Kilgariff -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystGood morning, guys. I just wanted to clarify something that's been touched on a couple times. You've reminded us that fiscal first quarter is typically a down quarter. You've got about $3 billion of maturities in the next three months or so. Is the current thinking that you're still going to pay those off at maturity?Tom Sweet -- Chief Financial OfficerWe are, and the maturity schedule looks something like that. We'll pay...we've got a $500 million legacy piece of debt coming due in April, we've got $2.5 billion due in June, and then we have some normal amortization of some of the term loans.Tyler Johnson -- Vice President and TreasurerThe A3 matures at the end of the year in December.Tom Sweet -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, but in terms of what's coming due in the next quarter, it's only $500 million, and then you get into Q2, and you have $2.5 billion, and then, Q4 is the term loan. So, it's spread out through the year. Yeah, the intention is to pay them off in full. Right now, we may dip into the line to manage some intra-quarter dynamics around liquidity and the position of cash around the globe, but that's the plan, which is why you've seen us build cash.Jason Kilgariff -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystOkay, great. And then, on the cash side, I think in the past, you've said that you're comfortable going to about $4 billion to $5 billion of cash at Dell. Is that still the right level to think about?Tyler Johnson -- Vice President and TreasurerIt fluctuates, but yeah, I think that's fair. It's probably currently closer to $5 billion, and it depends, as cash sits temporarily in different locations like China and India, which we continue to work to get out when we can.Jason Kilgariff -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystGreat, guys. Thank you very much.Rob Williams -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsRegina, I think we've got time for one more.OperatorOur final question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.Philip Winslow -- Wells Fargo -- Managing DirectorHey, thanks for taking my question. Obviously, I'm just looking at VMware filings, you're seeing the relationship with Dell ramp in terms of that reseller agreement. When you look at the go-to-market synergies that you've realized to date post-transaction, I'm wondering if you could just give yourself a grade. Obviously, it's ramping, but what's worked, what's still to come? When you think about fiscal '19, what is the focus there in terms of whether it would be go-to-market or product synergies?Tom Sweet -- Chief Financial OfficerI'm pretty happy, actually, with the work that's been done on the synergy front in terms of revenue synergies. I think the teams have worked well together. I think we're working effectively as the family of Dell Technologies. We've exceeded -- we had first-year synergy targets that we've exceeded as a result of the work that's been done by the collective teams. We think there's more to do as we think about the position and where technology trends are headed. We think about things like vSAN Ready Nodes that we're driving and some of the software-defined movements that are more server-oriented, so we think there's continued opportunity to do a more holistic integration with some of our hardware products with the VMware offerings.So, we think this is going to continue to ramp as we go through FY '19. We think it's beneficial both for our customers and, clearly, for Dell Technologies and VMware. And so, we're very optimistic about the opportunities. It doesn't mean we don't still have work to do in some of these areas as we continue to align our go-to-market positioning, coordination, and efficiency at a customer level, ensuring that we present one face to the customer. So, there's some work to do in that area, but overall, pretty optimistic and pleased with where we are to date on the revenue synergy side.Philip Winslow -- Wells Fargo -- Managing DirectorCool.
