Seagate Technology: This Buyout Bust Still Made Investors Rich,Jan.25.13,"With the buyout talks of Dell heating up and the rekindling of a potential buyout of Best Buy back on the table, we decided to find out what one of billionaire David Einhorn and Greenlight Capital's top picks has been up since its run in with the LBO markets in 2010. Seagate Technology (STX) rejected a potential buyout in 2010 by private equity firms, claiming that the price was too low. Since the tech company rejected the buyout bid in 2010, the stock has surged 145%, compared to the NASDAQ Index's 25%. Many hedge funds, along with Einhron, have been buying up shares of Seagate, including Jim Simons and Ken Griffin (check out all the hedge funds in love with Seagate).Billionaire David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital jumped into Seagate during the first quarter of 2011 by buying up 3.2 million shares. At the time he joined fellow billionaire Eddie Lampert of ESL Investments who owned 7.9 million shares. Since then ESL has dumped almost all of its shares, but Einhorn has managed to up his ownership to 16.5 million shares -- almost 5% of Seagate's outstanding shares (check out Lampert's newest picks).Buyout rejection. Seagate ended the latest buyout talks in 2010, which would have been its second takeover in the last decade. While some analysts thought that the termination of a buyout was no surprise, citing the fact that the industry was in decline and fundamentals would remain weak for the foreseeable future. This has not been the case. After the buyout of Seagate was abandoned, some analysts noted that the future free cash flow for the hard disk drive makers was highly uncertain, where one ThinkEquity analyst estimated the numbers to be $1.2 million annually, an underestimate to say the least.Lots of cash. In early 2012, Seagate upped its stock buyback plan to an authorized $3.5 billion in an effort to return cash to shareholders. Returning cash to shareholders should continue to be the norm, where the company has already amassed $2.4 billion.The free cash flow generation by Seagate has been very impressive over the past few years:"
HAMR Will Make Seagate One Of The Best Tech Plays With Significant Upside,May. 9.13,"Last week Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) reported its fiscal Q3 financial results. Seagate's revenue of $3.53 billion and EPS of $1.26 topped analysts' estimates. Profits slipped by a whopping 64% year-on-year while revenues were down by 20% on an annual basis. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Aaron Rakers calculates enterprise drive shipments were 15.9 million in the first calendar 2013 quarter -- a 7% rise sequentially. He says such shipments were:Q1 2013 - 15.9 millionQ4 2012 - 15.0 millionQ3 2012 - 13.2 millionQ2 2012 - 17.8 millionWhile nobody expects Seagate's TAM (total addressable market) to improve significantly amid an overall weak PC market in the near-term, as projected by IDC and Gartner, Seagate's pricing and margins are expected to remain firm going forward. The industry has been successfully maintaining a stable pricing environment by curtailing production as and when needed.Seagate has developed a new technology, known as HAMR, which will have far-reaching implications for its stock. In this article I'll delve deeper into this technology, and analyze its potential impact on Seagate's stock.Seagate Optimistic About Areal Density GrowthSeagate believes the next few years the storage industry will present the company new and significant opportunities, Seagate management said in a conference call post earnings.For the first nine months of the current fiscal year, Seagate has shipped over 130 exabytes of storage, reflecting 33% year-over-year growth, which is well above the current areal density growth rate. For calendar 2013, Seagate believes the storage industry is on pace to ship 500 exabytes of storage, and is advancing at a rate which is more than twice greater than expected areal density growth rate.Seagate increased capital investment in new storage technologies to support a broader product portfolio of storage devices, including hybrid, solid-state drives and other devices and services, which Seagate believes, will be critical to follow the mobile compute environment."
Western And Seagate: Surprising P/E Ratios,May.13.13,"All data and information in this article is either from the companies' SEC filings or S&P stock reports.I recently funded some retirement accounts and have since been looking for an investment to park the cash in. Unfortunately, I haven't had much luck finding something that I feel confident will do well at current prices. As Warren Buffett says, an investment opportunity should ""hit you over the head"" and I haven't gotten that feeling lately. So, it was exciting when my screener brought up Western Digital Corp. (NYSE:WDC) and Seagate Technology PCL (NASDAQ:STX). Both companies are leaders in the internal and external electronic storage device industry. Chances are, if you've ever needed some extra storage space for your computer files, music or photos, you've come across them in your search for a good, durable hard drive. Yet, the valuation on these stocks seems shockingly low. WDC is trading at a P/E of ~7, while its P/B is 1.66 and STX, Western Digital's biggest competitor, which is trading at a P/E of ~ 5.5 and a P/B of 5.2. The question is, why are both companies trading at such low multiples and will either one be a good investment for the long-term.Quick ComparisonThe following is a quick comparison of WDC's and STX's pertinent information and ratios. FY 2011 both experienced flooding in their Thailand facilities, which is why they both had weak revenue and earnings in that year.When looking at the financial statements for STX and WDC, one can quickly see a big difference. (Per share data is calculated based on current amount of shares outstanding.)Western Digital's balance sheet is one that shows conservatism. According to WDC's most recent quarterly data, they have a debt/equity ratio of 0.25, current ratio of 2.28 and a tangible book value of $24.32 per share, of which $16.86 is in cash and cash equivalents. For FY 2012, the income statement showed a profit of $1,612 million or $6.75 per share. S&P analysts recently raised their estimates to $8.50 per share for FY 2013. As shown above, in FY 2012 they had gross margins of 29% and profit margins of 13%, the return on equity was 24.5%. In FY 2012, they had free cash flow of $2,350 million. In March 2012, they acquired HGST for $4.3 billion, of which $3.5 billion was in cash. In 2012, they started to pay a dividend, and seem to be continuing to do so in 2013. The current dividend yield for WDC is 1.7%.Seagate's balance sheet is not as conservative. They currently have a debt/equity of 0.75, current ratio of 1.92 and a tangible book value of $6.67, of which $5.32 is made up of cash. In FY 2012, they showed profit of $2,862 million or $7.98 per. S&P analysts expect their operating earnings to fall to $5.11 per share in FY 2013. Seagate stopped its dividends during 2009 and 2010. However, since 2011 they have gone back to paying dividends, which currently yields 3.7%."
The Cyclical And Secular Risks Of The PC Industry,"Jan. 8, 2013 6:13 PM ET","The PC industry is affected by both cyclical trends and secular shifts. Affects on the PC industry funnels though all sub-sectors of the PC industry, including PC manufacturers like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), semiconductors like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advance Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and hard-drive makers like Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NYSE:WDC). This article will look at the cyclical risks (average 3-4 years PC replacement cycle, product upgrade cycles) and secular risks (mobile smartphones and tablets replacing desktops) of investing in the PC industry, and its affects on the various companies within its sub-sectors.Cyclical versus secularWhat does cyclical and secular mean exactly? Broadly speaking, just remember cyclical means short-term and secular means long-term. Keep in mind that you can have both cyclical and secular trends co-exist within an industry.Cyclical means that the industry's growth will go through peaks and troughs. Each growing or declining phase is short-term, because eventually the other side of the equation will come around. For example, industrial or commodity-related industries are high cyclical industries, because they are heavily tied to overall spurts and slowdowns of the economy. Also, think about durable goods such as automobiles, TVs, and desktops/laptops (versus non-durable goods such as food, health and beauty, cleaning products, etc.). Durable goods are typically cyclical, because they have long replacement life cycles (average lives of cars 8-9 years, TVs 6-7 years, computers 3-4 years). If there was a big spike in demand in a given year (peak), then it would take multiple years of slower growth in-between (trough), before the buyers from year one bought replacement products (peak). Non-durable goods companies, such as Proctor and Gamble (NYSE:PG) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), typically are not cyclical because their products have short-shelf life and require you to make purchases regularly (well, besides commodities where you can have significant seasonal and cyclical spikes)."
The Innovator's Dilemma: Is Apple A Sustainer Or Disrupter?,Jan. 1.13,"I am reading the book, The Innovator's Dilemma, (1997, revised 2011, Harper Business and Harvard Business School Press) primarily for my work in the biotechnology space, but I quickly saw that it had some investing ramifications. The author, Clay Christensen, has a website here, and a book chapter is available here. The book starts with a case study of the computer hard disk drive market, going back to the 1960's. For computer geeks, it's actually a pretty good read about the technology and how innovations occurred over the years.In summary there are two types of innovations:Sustaining technologiesDisruptive technologiesSustaining technologies are described as incremental improvements demanded by the main current customers of the dominant companies within a sector. In technology this would mean things like more memory, faster memory, larger storage capacity, etc. Large, dominant companies do this quite well because they have existing customers who already want these changes, along with all the barriers to entry keeping a new competitor from easily being able to do this.Disruptive technology is not as intuitive, at least to me. It serves new markets - usually unanticipated markets. (And markets that the category killers usually don't want to serve, due to lower margins or lower short-term sales forecasts in the new category). In the disk drive example used throughout the book, an example of disruption was smaller hard drives. The existing customers, such as mainframe and minicomputer manufacturers like International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), did not want or need smaller drives, which cost more per megabyte and the space savings was not consequential to them. Thus, the previous dominant drive makers failed to introduce smaller drives until it was too late, because their customers did not want them. Obviously, smaller hard drives did serve new customers, such as desktop and then laptop computers. But surprisingly, it was newer companies such as Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital Corp. (WDC) that served these markets, and not the formerly dominant companies."
Facebook's Greatest Strength May Be Its Greatest Weakness - Buy Something Else,May. 9.13,"Let me ask every reader first, what is Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) greatest strength? Is it the best way to communicate with friends and family? It cannot be as Skype (owned by MSFT) with 33%+ international call market share, Snapchat, Viber and Whatsapp with 200 million+ active users all demonstrate that thriving alternatives exist. Is it the best place to store and share photos? If that were so, why are sites like Flickr (owned by YHOO), Imgur and cloud-storage sites like Dropbox and SkyDrive continuing to proliferate? Is it the best place to share your idle thoughts and give status updates? It cannot be that as Twitter with 400 million tweets per day and Tumblr with over a 100 million blogs are thriving. What about sharing your ""likes?"" This cannot be true either as Reddit and Pinterest approaching from different angles continue to gain popularity. Is its success because it is the place one goes to find reviews of local businesses? That cannot be true either, for if one searches for the answer, they get responses from sites such as Tripadvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) or Yell.com. Personally, I find ""HERE"" (owned by NOK) does the job for me admirably. So just what is Facebook's greatest strength?Facebook's Real Greatest StrengthWhat is most admirable about Facebook is that it combines all of the previously mentioned services into a coherent whole that is not available anywhere else on the internet in one place. It then uses its inbuilt services such as Instagram and Facebook Home to help create the world's largest social network. The number of its ""Monthly Active Users"" (MAUs) is thus proudly showcased as the first statistic in all of its earnings slides to investors.Source: Facebook Quarterly Earnings Slides Q1-13"
"Diversifying Your Portfolio: The $50,000 Growth Strategy","Feb. 10, 2013 5:53 AM ET","The concept of diversification has always been quite clear: The goal is to invest in a number of sectors, markets, and types of investments to be better protected from volatility and to perform better over the course of many years. Most people believe that you need a balanced presence of REITs, bonds, ETFs, etc. in order to be diversified. While these investments work for many, and have paid dividends, it's not my preference and I believe better returns can be achieved with equity investments in the stock market with a number of new age strategies.There's a reason that I don't like the idea of a balanced portfolio with the use of bonds: I consider it a mindless investment strategy that has become more of a rule on Wall Street versus a sensible approach to investing. Personally, I want to invest in something that makes money, that reports earnings, and that produces a product or offers a service that I can see, touch, and utilize. Therefore, I don't like investments in commodities, as I don't like any investment that is only controlled by fear and greed (i.e. gold). My investment goal is to buy low and sell high, as is everyone else's goal. But if interest rates are at zero, then there is nowhere to go but up over a period of time for bonds. Hence, bonds have reached a peak, and when interest rates begin to rise, bonds will fall, meaning it's no longer a ""buy low sell high"" investment.Now there is no denying that investments such as bonds have been good for many years. But after more than a decade of flat trading, it now looks as though equity markets are preparing for a breakout higher, or to at least find some stable ground. Either way, regardless of market direction, there are numerous companies that pay high dividends that can return nice gains for an investor in any stage of their life. In this article I am looking at one specific group of investors, those with a med-high risk tolerance, who wish to earn higher returns with slightly more risk while still be protected for the long-term. The good thing about a high-yield dividend investment strategy is that risk is naturally lower as investors and institutions hold the investments longer. Therefore, I am going to show you how to diversify a $50,000 portfolio in equities alone with a med-high risk approach."
5 High-Beta Dividend Stocks To Try To Beat The Market,"Apr. 2, 2013 9:12 AM ET","By Serkan UnalThe U.S. stock market is reaching new record highs, and its outlook for this year is optimistic. A large number of analysts, financiers, and economists, including David Tepper of Appaloosa Management and Jeremy Siegel, a professor at Wharton School of Business known as the ""Wizard of Wharton,"" are forecasting market gains of up to 20% this year. While a 20% gain for the year based on passive index investing in the broad market would be excellent, and even better would be a possibility to outperform the market. One strategy that tries to achieve that goal during the bull runs is high-beta investing.Over the past four years of the market's uninterrupted rally, high-beta investing outperformed the S&P 500 in three out of four years - with a substantial margin, based on the performance of the S&P 500 High Beta Index. The strategy is based on picking the stocks with the highest beta, or volatility of the stocks' daily returns relative to the returns of the broader market over a certain period of time. Stocks with beta higher than the market's 1 will move in the same direction as the market but with higher volatility. This means that if the market gains 5% in a day, theoretically, high-beta stocks will gain more than the market, depending on their beta. Add to the strategy attractive dividend yields, and the strategy looks ripe for market-beating results. With this in mind and given the expectations of an extended market rally this year, here is a list of five high-beta dividend-paying stocks that could move more than the market.Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX), the number one hard drive manufacturer, is a high-beta dividend play. It pays a dividend yield of 4.4% on a payout ratio of 29%. The stock has realized a total return of 38.8% over the past 12 months. Its beta is 2.67, suggesting that the stock's returns could be as many times higher than the broader market's. Seagate has reported five consecutive quarters of earnings growth. However, this year, analysts expect the company to report a 6% decline in revenues and a 22.8% decline in earnings. IHS iSuppli projects overall HDD revenues down 11.8% this year and flat in 2014. A return to growth in revenues will help STX's bottom line resume its expansion next year. So far this year, however, the weak projections have not discouraged the stock's upward thrust. Looking at the opportunities, the enterprise demand and cloud computing trends bode well for STX, countering the negative trends in the PC market. STX is committed to distributing through dividends and stock buybacks as much as 70% of its operating cash flow. The stock is a value play, trading at 7x forward earnings versus 6.5x for its smaller rival Western Digital Inc. (NYSE:WDC). Last quarter, Jim Simons was bullish about STX, while David Einhorn cut his STX share ownership in half to 8.4 million shares."
A Remarkably Reliable Way To Predict Post-Earnings Price Moves,"May 19, 2013 8:56 PM ET","For the past several months, I have been working on a model to predict the direction a stock will move after the company reports its quarterly earnings. The underlying assumption is that the level of expectations leading up to the announcement is more important than the actual numbers that the company reports.If expectations are unusually high going into the announcement, something in the announcement invariably seems to disappoint investors, and the stock price usually falls, regardless of how well the company does compared to analyst expectations (or even whisper numbers).The disappointment might be based on something other than earnings -- it could be revenues, margins, or guidance, or something entirely different, like an expected dividend boost that didn't come through. In any event, when expectations are through the roof, the chances of some kind of disappointment and a lower stock price are increased dramatically.Surely, anyone who has invested in stocks over the years has had the euphoric experience of reading about how your favorite company exceeded earnings by a wide margin, only to be devastated the next day when the stock price fell in response the wonderful news. It is one of the most painful times in our investment life, and the pain seems to be so much greater than the joy of seeing the stock move higher.This report will explain how to measure the level of expectations so that you can better predict what will happen to the stock price once earnings are announced. But first, I would like to report how well my model has worked so far. Check out the full results.Here are the last eight earnings plays that I made in a brokerage account I carry out for my Terry's Tips newsletter subscribers:Company GainJPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) 38%Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) 39%eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) 7%Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 39%Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) 6%Green Mountain Coffee (NASDAQ:GMCR) 18%Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) 15%Sina Corporation (NASDAQ:SINA) 19%The average gain was over 22% after commissions and there was not a single loss. I reported on many of the option plays I made in advance of making them with Seeking Alpha articles -- you might see how the model measured expectation levels prior to the earnings announcement:"

Building A Magic Formula Dividend Portfolio,"Feb. 25, 2013 5:51 PM ET","With low interest rates in the bond market, many investors are embracing credit risk in the junk bond market or taking on interest rate risk with long-duration bonds.Instead, Joel Greenblatt's Magic Formula can be re-purposed to find attractive stocks that pay dividends. In a prior article, we showed that it could be restricted to picking dividend-paying stocks without detracting from the performance of the Magic Formula. Encouraged by this success, we used this screening method to create a current list of the best dividend stocks to buy in today.This strategy is designed for income investors who are concerned that dividend-yielding stocks are becoming too pricey. It combines a screen for dividend income with Greenblatt's screen for the best stocks trading at the cheapest values.What is the Magic Formula?Joel Greenblatt reported enviable annual 30.8% returns for his ""Magic Formula"" in his book, ""The Little Book that Beats the Market"". Since publishing his book, his strategy has performed well. Though many analysts who have followed the ""Magic Formula"" have not seen 30.8% annual returns, they typically report outperformance from this strategy. His results are particularly interesting because his picks are not subjective: they are based on a simple ranking of earnings yield (EBIT/EV) and return on capital.Even more interesting, Magic Formula stocks have historically outperformed the market with a total portfolio which is a blend of value and growth with a beta of roughly one. This blended profile of Magic Formula picks lends itself to do-it-yourself investors as a core holding strategy. Moreover, since many of these picks have dividend yields, they can be used to create an income portfolio.Screening for Magic Formula Dividend StocksThe following methods were used to extract appropriate dividend-yielding stocks from Greenblatt's Magic Formula results:Stocks were selected using the Magic Formula methodology. Each of these stocks is one of a top-50 selection with a $50 million, $2 billion, or $10 billion market capitalization minimums."
5 Good Reasons I Am Bullish On SanDisk,Apr.22.13,"SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) designs, develops and manufactures data storage solutions using its flash memory, controller and firmware technologies. It is a pioneer in NAND technologies and holds many key patents. Its stock has recovered well after June last year, when it fell from around $50 to $30 in just two months. Since then it has been following an upward trend. The company announced its quarterly earnings recently in which its revenue grew by more than 11% year-on-year while it reported an EPS of $0.84 against an estimate of $0.79. The retail channels produced year-over-year revenue growth of 34%. This performance was much better than the consensus estimate.I see 5 good reasons why this stock looks like a buy to me. Let me enumerate them -Solid State Devices (SSD) future demand growthStabilization of Average Selling price (ASP) per gigabyte of flash memoryExpected flash memory market share growthSurge in smartphone demandYen effectSSD growthIn Q1 2013, SSD products contributed 20 percent of the total sales for the company. This was a 200% increase over last year same quarter. The combined sales of Client and Enterprise solid state devices tripled year-on-year. The company expects the SSD share in revenues to increase to 25% of the total sales in 2014.According to a report, the market for enterprise SSDs will grow from 3,82,000 units in 2011, to 3.9 million units in 2016, representing average annual growth forecast of 59%. This will increase the SSD revenues from $582 million in 2011, to $3.5 billion in 2016, an average annual rate of 43%. This growth will be driven by SSD price decline, HDD substitution and internet growth. The two graphics below further substantiates the point."
9 High-Yield Stocks Undervalued By Levered Free Cash Flow,"Jan. 12, 2013 3:56 AM ET","Do you prefer stocks that pay handsome dividends? For a closer look at high dividend yield stocks, we ran a screen.We began by screening for high dividend yield stocks: those having dividend yields above 3% and sustainable payout ratios below 50%.We screened for stocks that appear undervalued relative to their cash flows, indicated by high ratios of levered free cash flow/enterprise value.Levered free cash flow is the free cash flow after deducting interest payments on outstanding debt. Enterprise value is the sum of the firm's value from all ownership sources: market cap, outstanding debt, and preferred shares. When companies have ratios of levered free cash flow/enterprise value in excess of 10%, it may indicate those companies are being undervalued.For an ‪interactive version of this chart, click on the image below.

"Diversifying Your Portfolio: The $25,000 Growth Strategy","Feb. 17, 2013 5:04 AM ET","Last week I wrote an article ""Diversifying Your Portfolio: The $50,000 Growth Strategy"" looking at the best way to diversify a portfolio in a ""new age"" market. The concept of a new age market is something I discuss in my book, which is basically to hope for a bull market but to prepare for a flat/bear market. It is one of many ways to psychologically prepare yourself for volatility, and while many of you will fall into the $50,000 category, there are many of you who do not. Therefore, I am looking at one of my more basic diversification strategies, one that is simple and effective, but that changes based on the size of the portfolio.One of the many principles that I teach is that there should not be a one-size fits all mentality when it comes to diversification. While the only goal of investing is to return more money than you originally invested, it's human nature that our perception and goals of investing change as we become both more experienced and as our portfolio grows larger. For example, if you are new to investing you are more likely to embrace risky behavior, such as chasing gains to make the quick 5-10% return. As you become more experienced you will ""eventually"" learn from these mistakes. If you don't learn, then you will more-than-likely lose your money to the more experienced investors who are disciplined and have developed patience.One of the reasons that new investors partake in risky behavior is because they are usually managing less money. An investor with $2,500,000 views his portfolio differently from someone with $25,000. Although both are important to the individual retail investor, it is the goal of the $25,000 investor to grow his/her portfolio to become the $2,500,000 investor. In this article I am writing specifically to the $25,000 investor, who wishes to take more risk while also having the potential for more reward. I urge you to first read ""Diversifying Your Portfolio: The $50,000 Growth Strategy"" to familiarize yourself with the theory, strategy, and the investment paradigm that is being used."

Delcath Systems: Too Many Red Flags To Hold Through May 2nd ODAC,Apr.29.13,"The preservation of capital should be the number one priority of all investors and traders. Do not invest when the risk seem to outweigh the reward. While I still think Delcath Systems (NASDAQ:DCTH) gets its FDA approval come September, what happens between now and then is anyone's guess.That being said, I am now a former DCTH investor. Last week, I came to the conclusion there were now simply too many red flags waving for me to hold through the May 2nd ODAC meeting. A few months ago, I had anticipated DCTH to be trading north of $2 by now and, while we did get a brief spike above that figure some six weeks ago, those levels were unable to hold and the price action seen since has not given me a reason to be hopeful.Additionally, even if the company were to receive a positive nod from the ODAC panel, there are no assurances that Delcath wouldn't use the ensuing spike (if it came at all) to tap into its recently announced ATM financing and squash any potential rally.I tried to love this company (and may have an affair again with it yet), but after holding the stock for over six months, I finally reached my breaking point last week and sold my entire position at a loss. After riding the low to $1.01 and the eventual rebound back to $2.19, I was used to the rollercoaster ride... but it was only very recently that I finally became unnerved enough to actually sell.Buying into Delcath, I was already familiar with the concerns: the slow reimbursement, the lack of partners, the ongoing fund raising, the switch from Gen1 to Gen2, the talk of needing to conduct more trials in the future to expand the use of the Melblez Kit/Chemosat System. I was willing to live with all those known risks in anticipation of the ultimate reward... FDA approval.But then the FDA date got pushed back another three months, then Delcath announced another $50 million ATM, and then it seemed as if the entire dynamic had suddenly changed for DCTH. Instead of rallying into the ODAC decision, any attempt at a breakout was now being heavily sold into. While that in itself seemed like a bad omen, it was the three red flags below that finally pushed me over the edge."
The Malay Dilemma: Is Malaysia A Safe Emerging Market Investment?,Jan.23.13,"When most western investors think of Malaysia, they probably think of the Petronas Towers, the somewhat notorious trials of opposition leader Anwar bin Ibrahim or controversial former Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad rather than ""The Malay Dilemma,"" the latter's equally controversial book that helped to set the country's course for the past 40 years or so. It also doesn't help that the iShares MSCI Malaysia Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:EWM) is really the only easy way for western investors to gain exposure to Malaysia - arguably Southeast Asia's forgotten emerging market because it's largely overshadowed by its neighbors.However, Malaysia is one emerging market that will soon be on the radar of western media again this year because Barisan Nasional, the coalition of political parties that's been in power for 54+ years, must hold elections by the end of June, and the country's large Chinese and Indian minorities along with some Malays are increasingly restive for change. And depending upon what happens in those upcoming elections, there could be a buying or trading opportunity for the iShares MSCI Malaysia Index Fund ETF.But first, investors need to take the time to understand the history of Malaysia, the so-called Malay dilemma and the country's rather complicated politics which are based around race, religion (Islam) and affirmative action programs for the so-called Bumiputera or Bumiputra (""son of earth"" or ""son of the soil"") majority.Understanding the Malay DilemmaThe Chinese and Indians had been coming to what would become the countries of Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei for centuries, but it was the British who brought in large numbers of Chinese and Indian coolies to work their plantations and mines during colonial times. By 2010, Muslim Malays accounted for about 60.3% of Malaysia's total population of around 29 million while the Chinese accounted for 22.9% and the Indians 7.1%."
War On SSD: Seagate Vs. Western Digital Corp.,Jul. 5.13,"General informationThe market of the data storage industry is divided into two types of manufacturers: the independent and captive manufacturers. The independent manufacturers are entirely focused on manufacturing hard disk drives (HDDs) and the captive manufacturers like Hitachi (OTC:HICTF), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) are diversified companies with a hard drive division. The most important difference between the two is that captive competitors may sell hard drives at break even profit or even at a loss when it can bundle drives with other more profitable components, such as computer memory. This makes competition especially intense and sometimes irrational for independent manufacturers like Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital Corp (NYSE:WDC).Due to the similarities in market share and business focus, Seagate and Western Digital are chief rivals in the market. The two companies' offerings cover 97% and 90% of the market respectively and both companies produce desktop, mobile, enterprise, and consumer electronics products, and sell mainly to OEMs. Thus, many of the same market forces such as seasonal changes in sales and commoditization of PCs affect the two companies in the same ways.Solid State Devices (SSDs)The position of both these companies is threatened by the new rising competitor of hard drives: The flash memory-based solid state devices. Unlike hard drives, flash memory are solid state, so they contain no moving mechanical parts, use less power, are smaller and less likely to break. These advantages make flash memory very attractive for use in portable devices such as digital music players, cameras and laptops. SSDs still have a few limitations and problems but these limitations are being gradually overcome with technological advances. So although hard drives are still the dominant storage device, SSDs represents an impending threat to Seagate's and Western's business. Following the International Data Corporation (Pending:IDC), sales of SSDs will continue to rise every year until 2015."
3 Stocks To Profit From Data Storage Growth,"Sep. 11, 2013 8:55 AM ET","With the global increase in Internet use driven by the penetration of the Internet and growth of the population, the requirements of data storage and database volumes will only continue on an upward trajectory. The chart below shows Internet users in the world by geographic region as in Q2 2012.The IDC projected that by 2020, the Internet universe will be 40 zetabytes in size. This is the result of the amount of digital information in the world doubling every two years between now and 2020. The growth of digital data is faster than the growth in storage capacity to store that data, as per IDC. However, much of that data, such as digital TV signals, is transient in nature and is not stored.In addition, the amount of data that is being generated, processed and stored by organizations will also continue to keep growing at a brisk pace for the foreseeable future. Storage is becoming a critical part of the infrastructure of every enterprise and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 53% between 2011 and 2016, as per IDC.We look at three data storage companies that operate proactively in this end market and what do they have for investors.SSD for data storage is the futureIn first quarter of 2013, SanDisk's (SNDK) solid state drive segment sales constituted 20% of the company's total revenue. As against this, it was only 10% in the same quarter in 2012. According to an IHS iSuppli report, global shipments of SSD in PCs are set to rise by a factor of seven by 2017, allowing them to claim more than one-third of the market for PC storage solutions by that time.Client SSD has the inherent advantage that it consumes low power and is much quieter. This end market should also show a significant demand growth of 53% year-over-year to 18.49 million units in the first quarter of 2014. SanDisk supplies SSDs to the top 10 personal computer manufacturers, and SSD sales are expected to contribute 25% of its total revenue in 2014."
"Western Digital Corporation - Best-In-Class, Misunderstood And Undervalued?",Nov.13.13,"In my last post, I outlined at a high level an investment case for Western Digital Corporation (NYSE:WDC). I continue to believe that it remains undervalued despite a 69% rally in its share price over the last 12 months, as both the business itself and the industry in which it operates is misunderstood by investors generally. I believe a conservative estimate of the intrinsic value of the business is between $21 billion - $25 billion, compared to its present market capitalisation of approx. $16.9 billion, representing upside of between 23% - 52%. In this post, I set out a detailed fundamental business and valuation analysis for WDC, which I believe justifies my estimate of intrinsic value.1. Executive SummaryWestern Digital Corporation (""WDC"" or the ""Company"") is currently priced at approx. $71 per share in the market, giving a total equity value for the business of approx. $16.9 billion.I conservatively estimate intrinsic value for the entire Company to be in the range of $21 billion - $25 billion, or $86 - $106 per share, based on a detailed fundamental analysis of the business, its industry, management and future prospects.My investment approach for equities is to acquire fractional ownership in businesses at a price that affords me a satisfactory margin of safety to mitigate against error, imprecision, bad luck or the vicissitudes of the stock market. I therefore look to pay prices that approximate no more than two-thirds of a conservative estimate of intrinsic value for an entire business or company.On this basis, my analysis leads me to conclude that WDC is a Buy at $63 or less per share, being a 33% discount to the mid-point of my estimated range for intrinsic value, of $23 billion. I believe that buying into the business at this price level should afford me a satisfactory margin of safety.2. Investment Thesis & CatalystsDespite the significant rise in its share price over the last 12 months, WDC remains undervalued in the market versus a conservative estimate of its intrinsic value. This undervaluation is attributable to a misunderstanding of both the Company and the data storage industry by investors. Essentially, WDC has suffered from a double-fear of obsolescence:"

Marvell In Transition - Future Profitability At Risk?,Jun. 2.13,"The technological transition from hard disk drives (HDD) to solid state drives (NYSE:SSD) is well known. This transition is especially critical for Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ:MRVL). The question presented in this article is whether profitability will be the casualty of this transition. However, lack of transparency in financial reporting is masking these profitability related risks. This article will outline two key reasons for concern.IntroductionMarvell is a fables semiconductor company. HDD storage controller is the main product. As a result of industry consolidation in recent years, the HDD controller market has become a duopoly with Marvell and LSI Corp (NASDAQ:LSI-OLD) being the two companies sharing the market.In addition to HDD controllers, Marvell also designs SSD controllers. The storage segment revenue includes both HDD and SSD controllers. In 2012 the storage controller segment represented 47% of Marvell's total revenue. Therefore the company is highly dependent on the storage segment.According to the Q1 2014 conference call transcript, HDDs are still the dominant source of revenue by a wide margin. Recently the HDD revenue has been declining. The decline in HDDs has been mitigated by a rise in SSD revenue. In other words, technologically more advanced SSDs are taking share as the transition gains momentum.In addition to the storage segment, Marvell has two smaller segments each accounting for roughly a quarter of total revenue: The Networking segment consists of switching solutions, which enable high-speed data transmission in communications systems. The Mobile & Wireless segment consists of complete system-on-a-chip (SoC) smartphone platform solutions, including communications and applications processors, wireless, power management and other platform components.Increased Competition in Storage ControllersThe technological transition from HDDs to SSDs has left the door open for competition. The following factors outline the change in competitive environment:"
Intel And Micron And Depreciated Fabs,Aug. 6.13,"Semiconductor fabs (fabrication facilities) are expensive things. They cost billions of dollars to build and equip. $5-6 billion will buy a fab capable of 100,000 300mm wafer production per month of logic products, more output if the product is memory. So what happens to the state-of-the-art fabs when they are no longer state-of-the-art? Do they go to ""fab heaven""? No, they are sometimes upgraded to be SOTA again, sometimes they are mothballed. Sometimes, as happened in the recent Elpida/Micron (NASDAQ:MU) acquisition, the fab (and company) is run through bankruptcy to come out the other side as a fab with written off assets. That happened with Elpida. Micron bought Elpida with Elpida's own money for a fraction of the value of the production assets embedded in the company. Now the Elpida operation of Micron is the world's lowest cost memory producer because there is no (very little) depreciation in their cost of goods sold. Micron really held up the stage coach on the Elpida deal.Depreciation can be anywhere from 20% to over 50% of the cost of producing an integrated circuit depending on the technology used.For example: Samsung (OTC:SSNHY) is spending $7 billion to build a NAND facility in china. A memory facility of that cost will be capable of producing about 150,000 wafers per month. These facilities are often depreciated over very short period to protect profits from taxes and because the technology moves along very rapidly. So, Samsung will probably write this facility to zero over five years. In five years that facility will make nine million wafers, so $7 billion will have be amortized over nine million wafers. Pulling out my trusty iPhone calculator and pushing a few buttons, gives me a number of $778 of depreciation embedded in every one of those nine million Samsung wafers. How would you like to be Samsung competing against Elpida/Micron with … umm, zero depreciation at Elpida?OK, now I'm going to switch gears on you. NAND memory is expected to grow substantially over the next three years. This will be due to the adoption of NAND based solid state drives in virtually all PCs. So, Samsung is doing the right thing by expanding production of NAND. Intel will ship, in a bad year, 300 million+ processor chips. Each of these processor chips will need either a hard disk drive or a solid state drive. The Intel sponsored Ultra book pretty much dictates solid state drives."
Ranking Technology Stocks By Dividend And Earnings Yield,"Jul. 4, 2013 8:08 AM ET","In my previous post, I decided to rank all the energy stocks, which are traded in U.S. markets, by the sum of their dividend and earnings yield. In this article, I have done the same for all technology stocks, which are traded in U.S. markets.I used the Portfolio123's powerful ranking system to grade all technology stocks based on this theme. Only stocks with a market cap greater than $100 million and price greater than $1.00 were taken into account. All the data for this article were taken from Portfolio123.The ranking system that I built searched for the best 20 technology stocks by the sum of their dividend and earnings yield. For the earnings yield, I used the average of the inverse of the trailing P/E ratio and the inverse of the forward P/E ratio.After running the ranking system on July 03, 2013, after the market close, I discovered the following twenty stocks:The table below presents the trailing earnings yield, the forward earnings yield, the average earnings yield, the dividend yield and the sum of the average earnings yield and the dividend yield for the twenty companies.SouFun Holdings Ltd (NYSE:SFUN)SouFun Holdings Limited operates a real estate Internet portal, and a home furnishing and improvement Website in the People's Republic of China.

Don't Accept Buyback Yield Argument Without Substantial Caveat,"Jun. 14, 2013 3:26 PM ET","Buyback Yield is an interesting concept, and a useful tool as part of stock analysis. However, it SHOULD NOT be used as a security selection or rejection criterion without interpretation with other data. What seems good could be bad, and what seems bad could be good.There are some advisors talking up Buyback Yield as if it is some kind of new magic bullet for yield seekers. Well we think it ain't so.It is a good idea for yield seekers to look for as much supplemental evidence of strength and shareholder reward as possible, and Buyback Yield has a role in some cases as a preliminary indicator. However, Buyback Yield can just as easily mislead you as point you in the right direction unless it is accompanied by careful consideration of other fundamentals, as well as industry and company specifics.Buyback Yield simply measures the percentage change in outstanding shares over a period of time.The argument for Buyback Yield is that if a company is using earnings to purchase its own shares, it is concentrating earnings - in effect yielding earnings to shareholders more efficiently than shareholders could do by receiving dividends, paying taxes on them and then purchasing more of the company's stock.For dividend paying companies, a combination of dividends received and earnings accretion due to share buybacks creates an extra dose of value creation. That is an appealing argument for what some call ""Total Yield"" (Buyback Yield + Dividend Yield).Certainly the idea warrants measuring Buyback Yield and Total Yield, but the data must be taken into context to avoid undue positive or negative views of a stock, and to avoid ranking stocks by Total Yield in a way that is misleading.How Might Buyback Yield and Total Yield Be Misleading?If a company issues shares to acquire another company, even if the acquisition is accretive to earnings, the Buyback Yield is negative and the Total Yield is reduced and may be negative. That would be misleading, unless you are simply opposed to acquisitions.If a company issues shares to investors to raise more capital when the stock price is high, and the new capital is to be used for CapEx for business expansion, the Buyback Yield is negative, but the implication may be positive.If a company reduces its outstanding shares by a repurchase program when the stock valuation multiple is high, the Buyback Yield is positive, but if the valuation multiple is unreasonably high and likely in your view to revert to a lower multiple, then that positive Buyback calculation would be a false indication of a positive effectIf a company reduces its outstanding shares with a repurchase program, but at the same time awards executives boat loads of stock options, the intermediate-term to long-term value of the Buyback Yield calculation could be very much in questionCompanies that step in with both feet to buy shares in a down market are often making a good choice, but the short-term Buyback Yield at that time cannot reasonably be projected into the future, and long-term average Buyback Yield may be distorted by a recent spike in share purchases due to a market downturn.Buyback Yield based on the past 12 months (as is the case with the NASDAQ Buyback Index) is far less useful than dividend yield as a long-term yield indicator, because share repurchase programs are often highly variable from year-to-year, whereas dividends have a far greater tendency to be carefully managed for consistency and growth."
Fabrinet Is A Good Way To Participate In The Telecom Spending Comeback,Aug.26.13,"ThesisFabrinet (FN), as an electronic manufacturing service provider of optical components and lasers is a good name to invest in if one believes in the comeback of telecom equipment capital expenditure. Two of its largest customers, JDS Uniphase Corporation (JDSU) and Oclaro Inc. (OCLR) have talked about business getting stronger in the second half.The company's focus on specialized and small volume items has helped it to maintain decent margins, and higher production utilization rates can help these margins further. With experienced management at the helm and a strong balance sheet, the company is ready to monetize the rise in optical equipment spending.Besides the strong cash flow from operations, cash balances can benefit from insurance claims settlement. Investors following GARP (Growth At Reasonable Price) style of investing may like Fabrinet at current levels of 5 times EV/ EBITDA and growing at 10-15% in a flat macro spending environment.Brief overview of Fabrinet's businessThe company provides electronic manufacturing services (EMS) to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of optical communications, industrial lasers and sensors.

How And When Should You Hedge A Dividend Portfolio?,"Nov. 20, 2013 1:18 PM ET","In a previous article (read here) I proved that a simple market timing technique could bring an additional return and a lower risk to a dividend portfolio, taking into account lost dividends and transaction costs. But even with a proof, most income and dividend-growth investors are reluctant to sell and buy again a whole portfolio, especially when the capital or number of stocks is big.For them, hedging is another solution. But hedging all the time has a cost, especially for dividend stocks. They often lag the S&P 500 index in bullish periods, and outperform it in downturns. Hedging them on the benchmark index will boost the return in bear markets, and scratch it in bull markets.How to fix it? You can use a market timing signal to detect risky periods, but instead of selling stocks, you take a temporary short position in SPY or a long one in SH. This is less hassle than selling and buying again all positions, less transaction costs, and less frustration about lost dividends. An inconvenient: it needs leverage and margin.I wish to illustrate the theory with a dynamic strategy I'm using on a real account. After a short description, I will compare the standard strategy and versions with market timing, hedging 100% of the time, and timed hedging. The aim is to measure the impact of protection tactics on a reference portfolio. The strategy itself cannot be detailed here.Strategy description:I list the S&P 500 stocks whose last registered dividend yield was 3.5% or more, and whose short interest is below 15%. Then, I apply a quantitative ranking using ratios on valuation, growth and debt. This is a pure fundamental strategy with a weekly rebalancing. There is no technical analysis involved. It gives an average annual return above 20% with the 25 best stocks on 15-year simulations. The following example uses only the five best stocks.Market timing indicator:I will use the same for both market-timing and timed hedging implementations. It is defined by a bearish signal when the S&P500 current year EPS estimate falls below its own value 3 months ago, and a bullish signal when it rises above this value. This is an aggregate fundamental indicator, not a technical timing. Of course, you can find better market-timing indicators. The choice of a 3-month period is common sense: it is a reporting cycle of fundamental data."
S&P 500 Best Balanced Stocks According To Portfolio123's Ranking,"Oct. 29, 2013 10:51 AM ET","A Ranking system sorts stocks from best to worst based on a set of weighted factors. Portfolio123 has a powerful ranking system, which allows the user to create complex formulas according to many different criteria. They also have highly useful several groups of pre-built ranking systems, one of them the ""Balanced4"" I use for my own investments.The ""Balanced4"" ranking system is quite complex, and it is taking into account earnings, technical analysis, valuation and industry leadership, as shown in the Portfolio123's chart below.In order to find out how such a ranking formula would have performed during the last 15 years, I ran a back-test, which is available by the Portfolio123's screener. For the back-test, I took all the 7,014 stocks in the Portfolio123's database.The back-test results are shown in the chart below. For the back-test, I divided the 7,014 companies into fifty groups according to their ranking. The highest ranked group with the ranking score of 98-100, which is shown by the dark blue column in the chart, has given by far the best return, an average annual return of about 23%, while the average annual return of the S&P 500 index during the same period was about 2% (the red column at the left part of the chart). Also, the second and the third group (scored: 96-98 and 94-96) have given superior returns. This brings me to the conclusion that the ranking system is useful.(Click to enlarge)"
Marvell Technologies Will Ramp Smartphone Chip Profits In 2014,Jan. 6.14,"Marvell Technologies (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a fabless semiconductor chip maker focused on SoCs (System of Chips) for data storage, networking, and wireless communications including smartphones. 2013 was a good year for Marvell investors. The stock ended 2012 at $7.08 and 2013 at $14.38, generating a 103% return for the year.It could be argued that 2013 was an anomaly because the $7.08 starting price was artificially low, a product of fear about patent litigation and about the supposed decline of hard disk drives (HDDs). I have concluded that Marvell will likely see a good revenue and profit ramp in 2014, resulting in a price closer to $20 per share. As the basis for that argument I'll look back to Q3 2013 results (actually, because Marvell is on a fiscal year, results for the quarter that ended on November 4, 2013; Marvell's fiscal Q3 2014).The whole Marvell mechanism summed up to GAAP earnings of $0.21 per share, up 75% sequentially from $0.12, and also up 75% from $0.12 year earlier. On a non-GAAP basis (mainly reached by excluding stock-based employee compensation) EPS was $0.32, up 39% sequentially from $0.23, and up 60% from $0.20 year-earlier.First note that the reported quarter is typically the seasonal high for the year due to higher sales of chips for devices sold to consumers during the holidays. However, much of Marvell's product ends up going into the enterprise market, which tends to be less seasonal.Marvell has the largest market share of any supplier of HDD controller chips. As a result the number of HDD units shipped by manufacturers like Western Digital (NYSE:WDC) and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) is critical to Marvell revenues. In Q3, despite a tepid global HDD market, Marvell revenues were up 3%, indicating another market-share gain. Marvell also had record sales of controllers for SSDs (solid state drives). While Marvell does not yet command the market share in SSDs that it commands in HDDs, it is well-positioned to substitute SSD revenue for HDD revenue. Recall that in 2010 some futurists predicted HDDs would be obsolete by the end of 2012, resulting in dramatic reductions in stock valuations for MRVL, STX, WDC, and others in the HDD business. Those of us who bought the stocks rather than the hype have done well. Today HDD still has a large cost advantage over SSD, and we also know that SSDs have problems with corruption and degradation that must be addressed by controllers, just like HDDs."
Will Flash Memory Spell The End Of The Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Industry?,"Jan. 28, 2014 7:05 PM ET","Monumental changes are taking place in the competitive storage industry, and changes are underway that could spell the end of the Hard Disk Drive (HDD) industry as we know it.Solid State Devices made from NAND flash memory chips, continue to gain market share versus HDDs. According to iSuppli, Shipments of PC hard drives are forecasted to decline by eight percent in to just 436.9 million in 2013. SSD shipments, on the other hand, are expected to increase 122 percent during the same period, to 68.9 million units by the end of this year. Since Intel's new processors and Microsoft's Windows 8 have both failed to boost demand for PCs, shipments of 2.5-inch hard drives for notebooks have been affected.According to IBM (NYSE:IBM) Table I shows the last 5 year history (2008 to 2012) of the growth of memory shipments for HDD and NAND. For this table, HDD units are drives and NAND units are 2 GB chips.Table 1Storage Memory Growth (2008--2012)Source: IBMThere are several issues apparent in this table:1. Units of HDD drives peaked in 2010 and has been dropping, so that the compound annual growth rate (OTCPK:CAGR) between 2008 and 2012 is 1.7%2. Unit shipments of NAND devices continue to skyrocket, exhibiting a CAGR of 74.8% I this same time period.3. Revenue growth for HDDs has been flat, and the uptick in 2012 was attributed to a shortage of HDDs due to a flood in Thailand in 2012 that shut down factories.4.

A Look At The SSD Market: Where Do Seagate And Western Digital Stand?,Dec. 5.14,"Hard drive manufacturers Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NYSE:WDC) face an uphill battle in attempting to sustain sales of traditional rotating-disk drives in the coming years. Since the introduction of flash-based memory chips, there have been constant talks about how long it will be before hard disk drives eventually become obsolete. NAND-flash based storage, or solid state drives (SSD), have numerous advantages over rotating-disk drives, ranging from the sheer speed of read/write operations, low latency in data access, relatively low power consumption, as well as lighter and more durable drives with a greater resistance to mechanical shock. So why hasn't there been an industry-wide switch to solid state drives already?It all comes down to the price. Traditional storage drives currently cost around 7 to 8 cents per usable gigabyte, whereas even the best-priced SSDs cost over $0.40 per usable gigabyte. However, it is interesting to note that SSD prices have been falling drastically in the last few years as demand has picked up. Prices are likely to continue to drop in the coming years, thereby posing a major threat to hard drive makers such as Seagate and Western Digital. In this article we take a look at the presence of NAND-flash chip makers in the SSD market and how the drop in SSD prices could impact them.How Costly Are SSDs Really?In dollar terms, solid state drives are over 5 times more expensive than hard disk drives (HDD) on average, as mentioned earlier. However, there are two points of note here. First, SSD prices are falling at a significantly higher rate than HDDs. [1] Although this does not imply that SSDs could become cheaper than HDDs anytime soon, it should certainly make purchasing a solid state drive more justifiable. Secondly and more importantly, SSDs aren't all that expensive if the price per gigabyte per second is measured - a metric which could be a more comprehensive point of comparison of cost vs. performance. For calculating this metric, the cost to bandwidth ratio, or the sequential read speed (in gigabytes/second), is used against the price of the drive to arrive at price per GB per second."
Western Digital Vs. Seagate Technology: The Key Takeaway From Earnings,Nov. 6.14,"Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX) are considered by many on Wall Street to be equals. Combined, they control roughly 85% of the hard disk drive (HDD) space. These are storage disks used in PCs, laptops, DVRs, and to back up the cloud. Over the last couple years, Western Digital has emerged as the superior HDD company, but in the third quarter, we learned something new that might very well change the balance of power.Each and every quarter, both Western Digital and Seagate announce two key pieces of data buried within their company slides. The first is the estimated size of the overall HDD market. For the most part, both Western Digital and Seagate's numbers are similar, give or take two million shipments. The second, and more importantly, is each company's respective share of the high-margin HDD market. Check out how these two companies have performed since January 2013:PeriodWestern Digital HDD shareSeagate HDD shareJanuary 201343.6%43%July 201344.3%41%January 201444.4%40%July 201445.7%39%As you can see, Western Digital did well at stealing market share from Seagate over a 16-month span. While there are no specific reasons for Western Digital's recent success, my personal opinion is that Seagate's products became inferior.Earlier this year, a very public Backblaze study found that only 73.5% of Seagate drives were still alive and functional after 36 months. The same study found a 94.8% and 96.9% 36-month survival rate for Western Digital and Hitachi drives. As a result of Western Digital's success, its company's valuation has appreciated at a much faster pace than Seagate Technology, as seen below."

The Evolution Of Storage: From Hard Disk Drives To Resistive RAM,"Oct. 22, 2014 11:55 AM ET","By Chris Burniske, ARK AnalystIn 1956 when IBM (NYSE:IBM) shipped the world's first hard disk drive (HDD),1 it cost $59,095/MB in 2013 dollars, and in 1988 Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shipped its first flash memory2 chip for an inflation adjusted $1,260/MB. Today the latest evolution of storage, resistive RAM (RRAM), sells for $34.50/MB, a much more affordable starting point. As shown below, given the inflation adjusted price histories of HDD and flash memory, RRAM will not stay at $34.50/MB for long.RRAM's unique characteristics include extremely high density, speed and energy efficiency. Combined, in time they should create completely new products. HDDs and flash memory did the same in creating their respective markets, minicomputers/PCs and mobile devices. But the RRAM evolution will take time as, per megabyte, it is currently 70,000 times and 700,000 times more expensive than flash and HDDs respectively.3Since their introduction in 1956, HDDs have enabled the modern computer era. They quickly displaced magnetic tape in the early 1960s thanks to faster access times. Since then, HDDs have created disruption continuously, as trumpeted by Clayton Christensen in Disruptive Innovation. The cause of this disruption was the disk (or platter) size, which shrank from 24 inches to 1.8 in six stages. Despite the smaller form HDDs initially being slower, more expensive and capacity constrained compared to pre-existing larger-form HDDs, they inevitably displaced their predecessors. Why? Because they enabled new architectures that made the computer accessible to a much wider audience.For example, in the late 1970s 8-inch HDDs accelerated the adoption of more user-friendly minicomputers over relatively inaccessible mainframe computers. The latter required high capacity 14-inch HDDs as well as specialized rooms, technicians and heavy capital outlays. The initial cost/MB of 8-inch HDDs was higher than their 14-inch predecessors, but because of their small size they cost less and gave rise to minicomputers, supplanting the demand for many mainframes."
Technology Stocks: Investing Vs. Speculating,"Sep. 12, 2014 8:24 AM ET","By Michael WassermannI am often asked in which technology stocks to invest. What people typically have in mind, however, is the new new thing, the hot IPO, the quick profit. Benjamin Graham would say that they speculate.In Security Analysis Graham distinguishes investing from speculating as follows: “An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative”.In the technology space, where greed is probably even higher than elsewhere, it’s quite easy to differentiate between investors and speculators, as shown below. I deliberately take a very crude, manichaean approach to illustrate the contrast in perspectives and provoke reactions.Why is it so difficult to successfully invest in technology stocks and avoid big losses? Mainly because of the rapidly changing industry dynamics, which are hard to predict. Product cycles are getting shorter and shorter, and intense competition is putting pressure on high margins.Source: ETF Database - Visual History of the NasdaqThe chart above, which depicts the market capitalizations of the top 10 Nasdaq companies over time, is telling. We see how devastating irrational exuberance can be: Cisco tops the ranking in 2000 with a market cap of $240 bn and barely makes it on the list in 2013 with half its former market cap (it earns 2.5x more today than back then but who cares…). Still, it fares better than other 2000 telecom darlings like Ericsson and Worldcom. Conversely, the latest ranking includes rising stars like Facebook and Gilead, which were insignificant a few years ago. The most stable name throughout these rankings is Microsoft, not really a cool kid stock."

Factor Investing: Value,"Sep. 14, 2014 10:23 PM ET","A simple example of value investing is selection of shares with intrinsic value higher than their market price. This method was popularized by Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing and more importantly, by Warren Buffet, arguably one of the most successful investors of all time. Also academic research concludes that the combination of cheap and quality shares have a good chance of delivering a solid return; see Assness et al. 2009, 2014 and Sloan et al. 2013. The chart below shows the performance of a portfolio comprised of shares meeting these criteria (we will not delve ourselves into the exact details of the algorithm here). As can be seen, a value portfolio can easily outrun the stock market, which is not a surprise for a value investor:(click to see results at QUANTPICKER)What will influence price of the shares in this portfolio? One of the key aspects is the movements in the stock market. If the stock market falls, value portfolio will not stay immune to the overall negative trend and its price will decline. Apart from this logical correlation, it is important to note that all value shares are similar in their parameters and there is a significant correlation among them. These shares are popular among value-oriented investors similar to Warren Buffet. While they might be able to beat the market in the long run, they are also prone to following the crowd when it comes to macroeconomic events, geopolitical risks, etc. As a result, these investors unwillingly cause price of cheap and quality shares movements to be synchronized with those of indices. The very fact that the individual shares in a factor portfolio behave similarly enables us to enhance our overall return."
Globalstar Hits A 5-Year High Amid Google's Broadband Push,Jun. 7.14,"After news broke in March that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was in talks to acquire Titan Aerospace, analysts quickly emerged to handicap the looming face-off between Mark Zuckerberg's brainchild and Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Project Loon.A month later, the debate ceased when Google swooped in and purchased Titan Aerospace for itself. The implication is that Google will utilize Titan drones to collect mapping imagery and deliver Internet services.A few months earlier, we had introduced Globalstar (NASDAQ:GSAT) to investors. Our interest was sparked by the discovery that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had performed tests on GSAT's satellite network. GSAT has been in the process of seeking FCC approval for a measure that promises to open Globalstar's spectrum to a range of interesting new possibilities, most notably public Wi-Fi service.This possibility places GSAT in the center of a strategic battle of Internet titans.Understanding their position requires knowledge of GSAT's capabilities. For starters, Globalstar's technology is known as an ATC (ancillary terrestrial component), which combines both land-based terminals and satellites to create a complete network on a single chunk of spectrum. The US Defense Department operates predator drones using exactly this sort of technology.Source: HowStuffWorks.comWith Project Loon now setting its sights on a similar network, it appeared that Google would need access to an ATC network for its drones. Rather than purchase its own band of spectrum for the drones, Google decided to partner with one or more wireless operators and lease their spectrum."
Micron: The Seagate Deal,"Feb. 18, 2015 3:00 PM ET","This is actually a story about four companies: Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Western Digital (NYSE:WDC) and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX).On February 12, 2015, Micron and Seagate entered into a strategic alliance whereby the companies will exchange technologies to build storage products that contain NAND memory where high speed is advantageous and magnetic (HDD) storage where low-cost and high data capacity is desired.More than anything else this is a NAND supply agreement between Micron and Seagate.On September 8, 2014, Intel and HGST (Hitachi Global Storage Technology) extended a business partnership, the main characteristic of which is that Intel will supply NAND memory to HGST.On May 12, 2012, HGST was acquired by Western Digital. So, really the July 29, 2014 deal is an Intel NAND supply agreement to Western Digital.Of course, we all know that Intel and Micron have a joint venture called IMFT (Intel Micron Flash Technologies) where they jointly develop NAND memory and other non-volatile memory technologies.We also know that IMFT (Intel and Micron) have recently announced a 3D NAND technology that both companies now describe as ""cost disruptive.""So, now the Hard Disc Drive duopoly members have access to the very same 3D NAND memory chips to make SSDs (Solid State Drives) or some combination of HDD and SSD.What does all this mean?First of all both of the members of the HDD duopoly found their separate paths to the same 3D NAND technology, so I would say that they individually picked what they felt was the best NAND technology.The problem is that both Seagate and Western Digital are doomed to a very predictable death spiral as solid state technology takes over the mass storage business. The timeframe for this death spiral is, depending on who you talk to, 3-4 years to never. Never being that HDD will never totally disappear. I don't know of anyone who would disagree that both companies will enter into a very painful period of decline that, in the best case, will devour 85% of their current business."
Will Seagate Technology Hold Up To Western Digital All-Helium Drives?,Apr.14.15,"Western Digital (NYSE:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) are the two leading hard disk drive, or HDD, manufacturers, controlling about 85% of the HDD market estimated to be worth more than $30 billion. Both companies are facing a steady onslaught from SSDs, or solid-state drives, which are increasingly finding their way into enterprises, data centers and even client applications. Gartner estimates that the $11 billion SSD market will grow at 40% CAGR through 2018 compared with just 2.9% CAGR for HDDs. Seagate Technology registered a 4.6% revenue decline in fiscal 2014 while Western Digital recorded a 1.9% decline.Even though Western Digital is more dominant in the U.S. in terms of market compared to Seagate Technology, it has frequently played second-fiddle to Seagate in overall market share. Seagate has often had a wider product portfolio than Western Digital that has helped it exploit a wider market and many more price points, not to mention that it's frequently been able to manufacture drives at a lower cost-per-gigabyte than its rival. For instance, Seagate has 8TB, 6TB, 4TB, 3TB and 1.5TB drives, whereas Western Digital has only 6TB, 3TB and 1TB drives.But, the tables have been turning lately, with Western Digital's market share growing while Seagate has been losing its share.What's going on behind the scenes?In 2012, Seagate Technology had a 48% market share compared to 43% for Western Digital. By the beginning of 2015, however, Western Digital's market share had grown to 46% while Seagate Technology's had fallen to just 39%.There are a number of possible explanations behind this phenomenon. I believe one of the most plausible is the launch of the industry's first helium-filled drive by HGST, a subsidiary of Western Digital, in November of 2013. After more than a decade of unsuccessfully trying to figure a way to reliably seal helium inside a hard-disk drive, HGST finally succeeded in manufacturing a 6TB 3.5-inch drive that consumed 23% less power and was 38% lighter than 4TB drives, which back then were the highest capacity drives in the market."
Why It's Still Too Early To Start Shorting HDD Makers,"Jan. 23, 2015 4:18 PM ET","The storage world is undergoing a disruption of apocalyptic proportions as hybrid SSDs and pure SSDs continue to cannibalize sales of their more pervasive HDD brethren. Whereas the SSD market managed to grow by 53.1% in 2013 to $10.9 billion as per Gartner, the HDD market could only manage an anemic 3% growth over the period to $33 billion. The outlook is not rosy either, with Gartner predicting that the HDD market will slug along at just 2.9% CAGR through 2018 vs. 40% for the SSD market. Massive consolidations in the space means that HDD manufactures are down to only three from around 18 in 1995. Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) and Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ: STX) are by far the largest HDD makers, and essentially run a duopoly with a combined 85% share of the market. Meanwhile, the adoption of NAND and SSD technologies at the expense of HDD is expected to accelerate going forward. It would therefore appear like it's a good idea to short the shares of the two companies, or not?Source: HGSTSweet Spot for SSDThe rapidly increasing value proposition of SSDs is making it very difficult for HHDs to continue competing effectively. With prices below $1/GB even for smaller 128 GB-256GB SSDs and performance specs that HDD simply cannot touch, it would appear like HDDs are headed for oblivion. HDD manufacturers have been countering this trend by offering more capacity for the same price. Consumers can now buy 2TB and 3TB HDD drives for the same price they did a 1TB drive about two years ago. But this strategy can only go so far. Most consumers do not typically need 3TB drives for their laptops, and many would be happy with a few hundred GBs. SSDs have not only managed to cut their prices, but also offer sizes that are almost at par with those of HDDs. You can now get a 1TB Samsung 840 EVO client SSD for $400-$450. Enterprise-grade RAID-based SSDs by companies such as LSI though go up to 4TB, but cost a princely $29,000."
Micron Investors Should Follow Baupost's Lead,Feb.26.15,"Seth Klarman's Baupost Group used to be the largest hedge fund shareholder in Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) before Baupost sold more than half of its position over the last five months. Baupost still owns 23.7M shares and is now Micron's eighth largest overall institutional shareholder. Micron's recent debt refinancing is positive as it reduced its dilutive share count and its new flash-based storage system partnership with Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) will help it develop new flash-based storage products. However, pricing for DRAM remains a concern, as well as the recent deal in which its competitor Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) agreed to supply DRAM for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and LG Electronics (OTC:LGEAF). Micron bulls seem to be underestimating Samsung as a competitive threat and it is understandable why Klarman cashed in more than half of its Micron stake in Q4 2014.Source: Who Wired KoreaBaupost owned 51.7M shares (4.81% of Micron's shares) as of September 2014 but now owns 23.7M shares (2.2%) as of February 2015. Baupost took a position in Q2 2013 and held 64M shares at its peak in Q3 2013 as well as $11M notional value of Micron's bonds. Baupost held 51.7M shares during the first three quarters, sold 32M shares in Q4 2014 and added 4M shares in February. Baupost's reduction in its Micron holdings signals to investors that they should not expect to achieve the same excess returns on Micron that Baupost achieved over the last two years."
Micron: The World According To NAND,Feb.19.15,"""You only grow by coming to the end of something and by beginning something else.""- John Irving, The World According to GarpLately, these SA pages have seen a number of articles on the new 3D technology that the IMFT partners Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have announced. On balance, the announcements by the pair are very positive, auguring good things to come. We have had a good discussion of the companies' differing language describing the opportunity that the new technology will bring. Suffice it to say that Intel thinks that this new 32-layer die will be the basis for a seismic change in the storage universe, disrupting current markets and changing the way NAND is perceived and used. Micron is more cautious, grudgingly using the word ""disruptive,"" emphasizing that 3D will be a strong differentiator for the company ""over time."" Here's Mark Durcan at the recent Winter Analyst Conference (email registration required):[...] when we have 3D NAND technology fully deployed, (... in 2017) it's going to be a significant cost improvement [...] and it puts us on a roadmap that drives significant manufacturing efficiency on a go forward basis relative to what could be achievable with planar NAND. It also drives much better performance [...]. We feel very very bullish about our technology position here and that's why we have the physical plant in place (in Singapore) to make the transition [...]Duran seems at pains here to sound a confident note, despite the more cautious language used elsewhere. That the two partners are not on the same page is somewhat mysterious, but let's leave that behind for now and focus on what Micron has revealed to us in the recent conference. I think we have the clues we need in the combination of the slideware and the commentary to give us a solid view of what's at hand in this monumental change in memory technology."
Intel And The SSD Market,Jan.12.15,"Recently, many voices from the investing community around Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are focusing on memory and storage. I tend to agree with fellow SA contributor Russ Fischer that the future of Intel is heavily reliant on memory and storage. I also think Intel is well-equipped to become the leader of this market. In this article, I share my vision for Intel and the SSD market.What Do HDD, DRAM And SSD Have In Common?Other than the fact that all are forms of digital memory and storage, those markets behave very similarly. Let's take a look at each market and its development.First, the hard drive disk (HDD) market. Since the early 1990s a consolidation trend has dictated heavy M&A activity in the industry. It took 20 years for the market to finally stabilize with only three players remaining: Western Digital (NYSE:WDC), Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY).Source: WikipediaThe progression of the market has been from hundreds of different vendors in the 90s, to dozens in the early 2000s, to only three players remaining in 2012.The DRAM industry is no different story, with three main players controlling the industry as of now: Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and SK Hynix.The story is the same: Huge, fast-growing demand for a product draws hundreds of vendors into the market. After several long years, a capital-intense technology race leaves most players in the red. Then, a fragmented market starts to consolidate, which enables prices to stabilize, and the big players to enjoy an even better cost advantage given their enormous economies of scale."
There's A Lot Of Value In The Information Technology Sector: The S&P 500 2015: Part 3,"Jan. 22, 2015 2:56 PM ET","IntroductionThis series of articles is offered as a sector by sector valuation perspective on the S&P 500 as calendar year 2015 begins. In Part 1 found here I presented a valuation overview of the S&P 500. In Part 2 I reviewed the Energy Sector component of the index. In this, Part 3, I will review the Information Technology Sector, which is the largest industry component of the S&P 500 comprising almost 20% of the entire index.Information Technology: Calling This a Growth Industry is a Gross UnderstatementWhen you stop and think about it, it was not that long ago when technology companies operated in a niche industry. As I was researching this article, I found an interesting report on the history of technology from The Wall Street Journal Classroom Edition that covered the Communications technology industry from circa 1920 to 1995, here is a link to that report.Clearly, the growth in technology from the beginning of this century to 1995 was extraordinary. But, as extraordinary as that growth was, it was nothing compared to what happened in technology from 1990 to 2013. Here's a link to a report from the website Preceden.com that covers this more recent time frame. Remarkably, technological advances continue to expand at what can only be described as at exponential rates."
NXP Semiconductors: One Stock You Don't Want Paying A Dividend,Feb. 8.15,"With a lot of tech companies now paying large dividends, from the nearly 3% at Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to the 3.6% by Seagate Tech (NASDAQ:STX), NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) is actually the one you don't want to see paying a dividend. NXP is benefiting from several trends in the tech world including the connected car and mobile payments such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay. As well, the semiconductor company benefits from a natural hedge to the euro collapse with a mixture of customers and operations in the area.The stock is up substantially in the last couple of years. Previous research suggested buying NXP back during the October sell off (see NXP Semiconductors: Perfect Storm Hits Stock), but is the dividend the key signal to owning this stock?Strong Q4 Benefited From Natural HedgeThe Netherlands-based firm has 20% of revenue denominated in the euro and around 60% of operating expenses. While U.S.-based tech companies saw several percentage points impact from the lower euro and higher dollar, NXP sees no material impact. When the euro plunges, top line revenue is slightly weaker, offset by lower operating expenses leading to a muted impact to the bottom line.NXP rode 81% YoY growth in the Secure Connected Device division to grow total revenues by 20% for the quarter. Without any impact from currency, earnings surged an even higher 26% to $1.35 and matched the typically strong Q3 numbers. The company produced $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the year.The numbers were so strong that the semiconductor company is only trading at 12.6x next years earnings despite the stock tripling in the last couple of years.No Dividends Until Better ValuedWith NXP having a market valuation in excess of $20 billion, the market of course wonders when the very profitable company will start paying dividends. It isn't like the company isn't returning capital to shareholders with stock repurchases of $1.4 billion during 2014. The company did an exceptional job of buying stock at an average price of $61.73 for the year."
Goldman: Buy during buyback blackout period,"Mar. 24, 2015 3:54 PM ET","Buyback-happy U.S. firms are prohibited from repurchasing shares from about five weeks prior to releasing quarterly earnings to about 48 hours after those reports. These blackout periods, says Goldman, may offer an especially tasty time for investors to pick up shares of their favorites.""High valuations in the absence of corporate demand may weigh on stock prices,"" says Goldman's Amanda Sneider, and particular areas of focus are tech, consumer discretionary, and financials - they've accounted for more than 50% of buyback activity.Goldman's buyback blackout theme buys: SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK), Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO), Travelers (NYSE:TRV), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), Xerox (NYSE:XRX), Torchmark (NYSE:TMK), F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV), Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS), Aon (NYSE:AON), Moody's (NYSE:MCO), VeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN), Hartford Financial (NYSE:HIG), Ameriprise (NYSE:AMP), Corning (NYSE:GLW), Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), Viacom (NASDAQ:VIAB), Legg Mason (NYSE:LM), XL Group (NYSE:XL), DirecTV (NASDAQ:DTV), Allstate (NYSE:ALL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), CBS (NYSE:CBS), Macy's (NYSE:M), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS).Now read: Skip The Internet Of Things ETF And Buy This One IoT Stock Instead"
Motorola Solutions: Leveraging Stock Buybacks While Waiting For A Buyout,Feb.10.15,"Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI) continues to leverage large stock buybacks into strong earnings growth despite declines in revenue. The technology company recently reported strong quarterly earnings and Bloomberg released that the company is looking for a buyer. At a market cap of around $16 billion after the big gains on Monday, Motorola Solutions isn't going to be easy to unload for a sizeable premium. Investors though have plenty of reasons to wait around.Up For Sale?According to a report from Bloomberg, Motorola Solutions is looking to sell the business. The communications equipment supplier is struggling with stagnant revenue growth, but it is still growing earnings per share. The stock jumped to $70 in after hours trading on Friday based on the news of finding an advisor to find a buyer. It now sits at multi-year highs above $68, but it is clear that a deal isn't that imminent.The company earned $1.25 per share in the last quarter, easily surpassing analyst estimates by $0.14. The market though didn't like that revenue is essentially flat YoY and the company forecasts revenue declining up to 4% in 2015. Due to margin increases and stock buybacks, earnings are inline to surge from $2.58 earned in 2014 to $4.02 in 2016.Meeting those EPS targets would limit the reason to sell the stock without a decent premium.Reasons To WaitMotorola Solutions provides investors plenty of other reasons to wait in the stock for a potential buyout as highlighted in a previous article. First, the stock pays a solid 2.1% dividend. Second, the company is flush with cash and has plenty of cash flow that it's using to reduce the share count.During Q4, Motorola spent $1.5 billion on stock buybacks including the $750 million deal with ValueAct. In total, the company bought an incredible $2.5 billion on buybacks during 2014. Motorola has more than $4 billion remaining on the authorized stock buyback plan."
"Micron Technology: Given Future Potential, Patience Is A Virtue",Apr.27.15,"Recommendation: BUY. Target Price: $40.7 (Stock Price: $29.3 as of 04/23/2015, Upside: 40%)SummaryStrong demand and constrained supply set up Micron (NASDAQ:MU) to take advantage of the favorable memory chip industry condition. The DRAM industry has consolidated into three major competitors. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), the biggest DRAM competitor with 42% of market share, is unlikely to oversupply the market or start a price war that would hurt DRAM manufacturers' margin. The lower NAND revenue guidance from SanDisk (SNDK) is a company-specific issue that was resulted from SanDisk management's poor planning and execution, and it had little to do with the future prospect of the NAND market. Micron's continued focus on technological innovation, its diversified product portfolio and healthy capital structure, and the favorable market condition all suggest Micron a buy.Why the stock is depressedThe DRAM industry had a long history of high rivalry among existing firms and high bargain power of customers, which pressured margins for Micron's core DRAM business (~68% of total MU revenue in 2014). In the past, the DRAM market was oversupplied by intense competition and was considered a commoditized market with high market fluctuation and price volatility. In 2014, Samsung invested $14.7B in building a new chip plant in South Korea with operations scheduled to begin during the second half of 2017. If Samsung utilizes this plant for DRAM and sets prices aggressively, it can oversupply the DRAM market and pressure Micron's core business. As this article suggests in later sections, aggressive pricing or oversupply is unlikely to happen as the DRAM industry consolidates and Samsung suffered from mobile sales loss."
Top 100 Dividend Stocks - 2015 Edition,"Jan. 3, 2015 12:06 AM ET","Ah! I have been rather quiet on this blog in the past few weeks, haven’t I? A big part of it was being incredibly busy, but also having little trading to do. That is about to change as we get ready for the New Year. First off, I’d like to wish all of you a very Happy New Year. To start off, before opening a few new long and short trades next week, I wanted to publish a recent edition of the top dividend payers in the S&P 500. In my next Ultimate Sustainable Dividend Portfolio update, I’ll certainly start looking for new names to be added. I always find this list to be very useful as a starting point.Again, I can’t stress enough how this list is only a starting point. Usually, the top players on this list are here because the company is doing poorly, resulting in a declining stock price, but the company has not (yet!) adjusted its dividend payout.

Seagate Is In Trouble And Nobody Seems To Care,Aug.27.15,"Do you want to be an owner of this business?Quarterly Adjusted Net Income (in millions)The prudent investor, suspecting a trick question, should ask at what price? For Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), the answer is ~15x last quarter annualized earnings (of the adjusted variety). And in my opinion, earnings will continue to decline over time. So the diligent investor should perhaps conclude that the potential reward is nowhere close to compensating the investors for the risk.One could conclude Seagate is the perfect example of the current late-stage bull market: stock significantly higher than 2012 levels despite falling EPS? Check. Stock buybacks and acquisitions supported by leveraging the balance sheet with new debt? Check. Large chunk of passive/ETF investors? Check. Zero interest rate policy induced dividend buyers? Check. Sell-side analysts moving in a herd and ignoring secular risks? Check. Very light trading volumes and limited liquidity? Check. Investors have forgotten that this is a cyclical business? Check.A little housekeeping - readers can find most of the facts mentioned in this article on this handy page. The other facts and figures can be found in Seagate's and Western Digital's (NYSE:WDC) public disclosures (STX here and WDC here).First, let's talk about the risks to Seagate's business:Risk 1. Lower end-market demand due to weaker macro (i.e., we have entered a tech demand cycle)Tech demand is falling in lots of markets and especially in emerging economies. China is often discussed, but keep in mind many economies and currencies are plummeting (Russia, Brazil, Turkey, Malaysia, South Africa, Mexico, Kenya, Kazakhstan, etc.), and goods priced in USD are increasingly expensive for local consumers. Emerging market economies can't print money and have to implement painful fiscal adjustments. We will likely start seeing consumers in Europe and the US start to pull back on capex/expenditures. How much will US energy companies spend on the latest technology? I'd bet a lot less than they were."
Seagate Technologies Stock Analysis,Oct.12.15,"Now seems to be a pretty good time to perform a stock analysis as we approach the middle of the month! We have had ups and downs within the market, and it really can't decide which way it truly wants to go. With interest rates remaining on hold (thanks Fed, was really hoping for a bigger discount... kidding!), the market has been a tick upwards over the last 1-2 weeks. I wanted to hop into a sector and stock that has been beaten down this year with what is perceived to be sound dividend metrics. How about the technology sector? Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ:STX) - you are up!The Stock - Seagate Technologies (STX)Per Google Finance: ""Seagate Technology plc (Seagate) is a provider of electronic data storage products. The Company's products are hard disk drives (HDD). The Company produces a range of electronic data storage products, including solid state hybrid drives (SSHD), solid state drives (SSD), peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) cards and Serial AT Attachment (SATA) controllers. The Company's products are designed for enterprise servers and storage systems for applications, client compute applications and client non-compute applications. The Company's product and solution portfolio for the enterprise data storage industry includes storage enclosures, integrated application platforms and high performance computing (HPC) data storage solutions. Its data storage services provide online backup, data protection and recovery solutions for small to medium-sized businesses. Its products include Enterprise Performance HDDs, Mobile HDDs and SSHDs, NAS HDDs, and Surveillance HDDs, among others."" Seagate is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, and is massive in the data storage arena. The main competitors would be SanDisk and Western Digital Corp. At $15B in market capital, Seagate is in between the two competitors and offers some very valid metrics when looking at it from a dividend stock standpoint. No, this isn't a foundation stock, it is definitely far from an Emerson (NYSE:EMR) (which I have bought 3x) and does not even take a sniff at Bert's 5 always buy stocks. Definitely a different approach here."
Who Buys Micron?,Jun. 5.15,"OK, now that I have your attention, we can talk about further consolidation and ""deals"" in the memory business.Who needs to be in the memory business?China has declared the semiconductor business a strategic business. A general semiconductor industry without a memory component is a weak hand. So China would have a serious interest in being in the memory business.Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NYSE:WDC) absolutely need to be in the NAND business or face a rapid decline to shadow of their present size.It is interesting the WDC has a partnership with Intel on NAND and Seagate has a partnership with Micron on NAND. Of course this is the same NAND technology since the product is provided by the Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)/Micron (NASDAQ:MU) joint venture. I discussed this in a previous article.Intel is in the memory (storage) business, but has an adequate deal, for now, through the Intel/Micron joint venture, IMFT.Who, in the memory business is available to be acquired?Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) is out, of course.Hynix is probably out, and in any case is weak in NAND, which is the memory growth of the future.SanDisk (SNDK) is available. It is only NAND, which should be of intense interest to Seagate or Western Digital, less so to China.SanDisk is fully priced and with an acquisition premium would be quite expensive. Still, it would get either of the HDD (Hard Disk Drive) guys into the NAND business. I find it curious that neither of the HDD guys has made a move on SanDisk yet.Micron is available, but any offer would have to be in the $40/per share area. With low rates, either Seagate or Western Digital could probably pull it off with stock and borrowed money. The nice thing about Micron is that their current earnings would make the acquisition accretive to earnings for anyone who might be interested, even with all borrowed money.China could pull it off with what amounts to lunch money, but one might expect our government to have something to say about that. Micron, after all, is the only Western Hemisphere based broad line memory company, and is therefore pretty strategic to old Uncle Sam."
Intel/Micron Joint Venture Might Not Last After 2018,Jun.29.15,"I don't know how to say this as constructively as possible without sounding alarmist in front of my readers. But, basically, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) have this partnership in NAND flash, and there's a buyout clause for this partnership that may favor Micron overwhelmingly. Of course, there's no telling if Micron will actually exercise the call that will start in 2018. But, based on the language, a call would imply that they have the right but not the obligation to buy back the remainder of the IMFT partnership interest in which they own 51% of.Intel has performed poorly in light of Micron's weak quarter and upside from that joint venture is being capped.Source: AmigobullsSome of the contributors on Seeking Alpha got into the gory details about how 3D NAND flash had immense upside potential and why Intel's consumer CPU business has a supplementary sidekick in flash memory. So, even if worst comes to worst, and Intel is unable to generate ramping CPU volume, at least the ramp up in solid state storage devices would make up for the difference. Unfortunately, Intel had signed away its right to own the NAND business for much longer.Quoted from the 2014 Micron Annual Report (page 80):"
SanDisk: The Acquisition Target,Oct.14.15,"SanDisk (SNDK) has been the subject of numerous rumors as an acquisition target for quite a while now. Recent rumors have centered around either Micron (NASDAQ:MU) or Western Digital (NYSE:WDC) acquiring the NAND leader headed by one of the most recognized names in NVM (Non-Volatile Memory), Sanjay Mehrotra.I wrote an article that suggested the paired trade of long Micron and short SNDK, but I have remained purely long Micron while remaining on the sidelines on SanDisk for now. While I am convinced that Micron's prospects are phenomenal, I am far less certain on what lies ahead for SanDisk.In my prior article, I believed SanDisk would lose its cost advantage in NAND once Micron starts producing 3D NAND and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) advanced another generation in its version of 3D NAND. Because of its lack of access to cheap DRAM, coupled with its loss of cost superiority in NAND, SanDisk seemed destined to be shut out of the rapidly growing smartphone MCP market. SanDisk is also likely far behind Micron (and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)) in developing a next-generation non-volatile memory. Micron and Intel will have 3D XPoint products out in 2016. SanDisk has just recently formed an alliance with HP (NYSE:HPQ) that is attempting to create a next generation NVM that has similar performance specs to that of XPoint. Realistically, the SanDisk team is at least 2-3 years behind Micron and Intel right now. The gap might even be larger than that. I hypothesize that Samsung and SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) are at roughly the same juncture in the development of their respective responses to XPoint."
Western Digital And SanDisk Are Planning A Funeral For The HDD,Oct.22.15,"With Western Digital (NYSE:WDC) now set to acquire NAND manufacturer SanDisk (SNDK), the foggy technology roadmap for Western Digital (and the HDD (Hard Disk Drive) in general) is starting to become clear. Sales at Western Digital and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) peaked in the 2012-13 timeframe and have since started to taper off by single-digit percentages annually. Talk of the ""death of the PC"" and by extension, ""death of the HDD,"" has been discussed for years. However, HDD sales at the two giants of the industry have only dipped a bit (pun intended) in the last two years. The era of a slow decline in HDD sales is coming to an end soon. If the NAND manufacturers are not wildly off in their predictions, HDD sales are about to experience enormous drops within 3 years.Western Digital's desire to acquire SanDisk is simple to understand - Western Digital needs to find a source of revenue in its post-HDD era. SanDisk is the cost leader in production of planar NAND flash, the NVM (non-volatile memory) that serves as the underlying technology that allows for the storage of data in SSDs (Solid State Drives). Relative to HDDs, SSDs are faster, more durable, weigh less and consume less power (and therefore emit less heat). In a nutshell, virtually all performance metrics of SSDs (that do not involve cost) are significantly better than those of HDDs. Unsurprisingly, everyone who has followed the storage industry knows with certainty that SSDs will eventually completely replace HDDs. The only question that remains is ""When will it happen""?I wrote an article in September that discusses the issue of when HDD sales will fall off a cliff. NAND manufacturers are building out their various versions of 3D NAND to increase the density of NAND dies, which equates to lowering the cost per bit. The NAND manufacturers plan to continuously lower the cost of NAND and get the price per GB of SSDs close to that of HDDs. While Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF), SanDisk (with Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY)) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) (with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)) have been working on lowering the cost of NAND, Western Digital and Seagate have been trying to delay the death of the HDD by also finding new ways to improve their technology (increase areal density) to lower the cost per GB of HDDs. The rate of decline in cost per bit for 3D NAND will be (significantly) higher than that of HDDs. With the estimates I used in the article, I estimated the big drop in HDD sales would occur sometime between late-2018 and early-2027."
10 Most Undervalued Companies For The Enterprising Investor - October 2015,"Oct. 25, 2015 9:05 AM ET","There are a number of great companies in the market today. By using the ModernGraham Valuation Model, I've selected the ten most undervalued companies reviewed by ModernGraham. Each company has been determined to be suitable for the Enterprising Investor according to the ModernGraham approach.Defensive Investors are defined as investors who are not able or willing to do substantial research into individual investments, and therefore need to select only the companies that present the least amount of risk. Enterprising Investors, on the other hand, are able to do substantial research and can select companies that present a moderate (though still low) amount of risk. Each company suitable for the Defensive Investor is also suitable for Enterprising Investors.Be sure to check out the history of this screen to find out which companies have been selected in the past!PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM)PulteGroup Inc. qualifies for the Enterprising Investor but not the more conservative Defensive Investor. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the insufficient earnings growth or stability over the last ten years, along with the inconsistent dividend history. The Enterprising Investor is only initially concerned by the lack of earnings stability over the last five years. As a result, all Enterprising Investors following the ModernGraham approach based on Benjamin Graham's methods should feel comfortable proceeding with further research into the company.As for a valuation, the company appears to be undervalued after growing its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from a loss of $3.12 in 2011 to an estimated gain of $2.14 for 2015. This level of demonstrated earnings growth outpaces the market's implied estimate of 0.23% annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years. As a result, the ModernGraham valuation model, based on Benjamin Graham's formula, returns an estimate of intrinsic value above the price. (Read the full valuation)"
Western Digital Worth $90 Following Recent Catalysts,Nov. 8.15,"Shares in Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) have taken a beating with the stock trading around its 52-week low and down 41% from its high of more than $114. Investors have reacted negatively to the proposed acquisition of SanDisk and failed to appreciate the positive catalysts of several recent developments.The acquisition of SanDisk, which will be financed in part by the investment by Unisplendour, will transform WDC into a storage technology behemoth with a broader product set, deeper technology base, expanded addressable market, and superior execution capabilities vs Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), its major competitor.The market appears to be ignoring a slew of corporate developments that individually and collectively provide major catalysts for the stock going forward, including:Unisplendour investment at $92.50 per shareMOFCOM decision approving HGST integrationAcquisition of SanDiskSolid execution combined with strong product and technology positioning resulting in increased market share in most lucrative market segment.Tsinghua Unisplendour InvestmentOn September 30, 2015, WDC announced that Unisplendour Corporation Limited has agreed to purchase $3.775 billion in newly issued WDC common stock at a price of $92.50 per share.

My Top Technology Hardware Stocks For 2015,Jun.22.15,"OverviewIn this series of articles, I will be taking a look at various industry sectors and selecting what I believe will be outperforming stocks for 2015. In Part 1, I reviewed 47 stocks within the Aerospace and Defense industry sector. For part 50, in determining my favorite stocks in this sector for 2015, I will review the following Technology Hardware stocks:3D Systems (NYSE:DDD)Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)Astro-Med (NASDAQ:ALOT)Avid Technology (NASDAQ:AVID)BlackBerry (BBRY)Cray (NASDAQ:CRAY)Diebold (DBD)Dot Hill Systems (NASDAQ:HILL)Eastman Kodak (NYSE:KODK)Electronics For Imaging (NASDAQ:EFII)EMC (EMC)Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ)Immersion (NASDAQ:IMMR)Intevac (NASDAQ:IVAC)Lexmark International (NYSE:LXK)Logitech International (NASDAQ:LOGI)NCR (NYSE:NCR)NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP)Qlogic (NASDAQ:QLGC)Quantum (NYSE:QTM)SanDisk (SNDK)Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX)SMART Technologies (NASDAQ:SMT)Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS)Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI)USA Technologies (NASDAQ:USAT)Western Digital (NYSE:WDC)Step 1The first step I took to narrow down the list of possible options was to look at the earnings over the past five years of these stocks within the industry sector.

A 5.4%-Yielding Portfolio Of 'Accidently High-Yielders',"Aug. 17, 2015 8:10 PM ET","On July 12th I wrote an article recommending four reliable dividend-payers which I considered to be ""accidentally high-yielders"" (a term borrowed from CNBC's Jim Cramer). The stocks I recommended were AT&T (NYSE:T), Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD), Ventas Inc (NYSE:VTR) and Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ:STX). I recommended these four stocks because each one was trading at a good discount.Well, that was over a month ago, and I'd like to update readers on the situation. Since June 12th, the S&P has been choppy but flat and crude oil prices have dropped some 20%. Of the four stocks I recommended, Seagate Technologies has done the best, going from $45 per share to $52. Ventas also did well, going from $64 per share to $68. In this article I update my recommendations for ""accidentally high-yielders,"" and go over a new portfolio that I would recommend beginning investors look into right now.RecommendationsIf you're going to own an oil and gas E&P, why not own the best one? ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) currently yields 5.95% and that dividend will be sustainable as long as Brent Crude returns to $75 and WTI returns to $70 by 2017. For various reasons, I believe that crude oil will reach those prices. Crude oil prices will return to the cost of marginal production plus a reasonable profit.Courtesy of Yahoo Finance.Conoco is heavily oversold here, and I believe the eventual snapback will give investors today a nice capital gain in addition to the 6% dividend you can lock in by buying here. Conoco's producing acreage is world-class, especially the company's giant core position in the #1 shale play, the Eagle Ford."

Netlist Inc. - Investors Are Overlooking Significant Progress On Product Side. NLST Could Easily Triple On Short Notice,"Jun. 8, 2015 3:03 PM ET","Note:Most of the contents in this Instablog will be summarized/included/edited in a regular SeeekingAlpha article to be published this week. Stay tuned. Investors are encouraged to do their own due diligence prior to making an investment on NLST (or any other stock for that matter).NLST stock price has fluctuated with legal victories and defeats alone having completely overshadowed progress being made on the product end of the business.Netlist is poised to launch its next generation products starting in June 2015. The life-cycle of these products is expected to last at lest three years.Some of the new products, like EXPRESSvault 3, are potentially blockbusters based on inherent superior performance, easy-of-use, and faster implementation than competing memory products.Netlist will be back on court against Diablo on July 8. The company requested a new trial and a permanent injunction on Diablo's products in a JMOL filed in May.Netlist Inc. (NASDAQ:NLST) designs, manufactures and sells memory subsystems for datacenter server and high-performance computing and communications markets. Netlists memory subsystems consist of combinations of dynamic random access memory integrated circuits (DRAM ICs or DRAM), NAND flash memory (NAND), application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and other components assembled on printed circuit boards (PCBs). The Company primarily markets and sells its products to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers. Its solutions are targeted at applications where memory plays a key role in meeting system performance requirements. The Companys products include HyperCloud, NVvault and Specialty Memory Modules and Flash-Based Products.Netlist has steadily invested in and grown its worldwide IP portfolio, which now includes 88 issued and pending patents in the areas of high performance memory and hybrid memory technologies.The company develops technology solutions for customer applications in which high-speed, high-capacity, small form factor and efficient heat dissipation are key requirements for system memory. These customers include OEMs and hyperscale datacenter operators that design and build servers, storage systems and high-performance computing clusters, engineering workstations and telecommunications equipment.NLST stock price has fluctuated widely in recent months almost exclusively due to positive and negative outcomes of its ongoing legal battles against Diablo Technologies and SanDisk (SNDK). But investors have failed to pay attention to significant progress the company has made on the product side. The new group of next-generation products, with a life-cycle expected to last at least three years, are on the launch pad and will have a significant positive effect on revenues and net income starting in June 2015.During a recent conference call, Netlist's Chairman and CEO Chuck Hong indicated that the company is focusing on three game-changing initiatives, 1) proliferating the NVvault product line, including EXPRESSvault, 2) bringing to market the fastest next generation hybrid memory solution - the HyperVault, and 3) monetizing its rich memory IP portfolio through partnerships with major industry players.Indeed, Netlist has been investing primarily in driving the next-generation NVvault product and the development of HyperVault.NVvault improves the performance and data preservation found in storage virtualization, RAID, cache protection, and data logging applications requiring high-throughput by combining the high performance of DDR3 DRAM with the non-volatility of NAND Flash. This NVDIMM utilizes Netlist's patented Vault cache-to-flash controller and works in conjunction with general purpose CPUs, RAID adapters, and other devices. Netlist has shipped almost half million NVDIMMs, more than all of its competitors combined, over the last seven years according to recent news.HyperVault is a memory channel storage product currently under development. It greatly expands the performance and capacity of DRAM channel storage. It is expected to be targeted at the fastest tiers of storage where latency is a critical issue, such as online transaction processing, virtualization, big data analytics, high-speed transaction processing, high performance database, and in-memory database. For the mobile smartphone market, Netlist's HyperVault Mobile Memory Controller (HVMMC) adopts cache buffer to decrease DRAM density thus delivering cost savings in the manufacture of smart phones while maintaining or improving performance.Analysts expect that the market that HyperVault will compete in will be multi-billion dollar market in years to come. Netlist's HyperVault product is expected to have significant performance advantages over the only product addressing this market today, the ULLtraDIMM.Netlist owns the patent on key parts of Sandisk's UtraDIMM technology (licensed from Diablo Technologies). Netlist's legal battles with Diablo Technologies and SanDisk are ongoing as will be seen later in this article.NLST is currently trading at cash value (the company had $21 million on March 31, 2015). This means that the market is not giving the company any credit for its extensive IP and for the significant growth that is expected to take place starting in the second half of 2015 as it will be discussed later in this article. NLST has been trading in a very narrow range for almost two months, but I believe that there are several short-term catalysts that could take the stock for a frequent trip from 50c to $2 as seen in the lower (weekly) chart.One analyst covering the stock has a ""Buy"" rating with a $3 price target. The consensus revenue growth is estimated to increase from $11.7 million in 2015 to $35.9 million in 2016 as revenues for the next-generation products start to ramp up. Institutional investors appear to be bullish on the future of Netlist as their collective holdings have increased significantly during the last reporting period.The recent apathy towards the stock is in stark contrast with Chairman and CEO Chuck Hong's bullishness about the future of Netlist - he recently stated:""The future has never looked brighter for Netlist as our next-generation products will be addressing rapidly growing multi-billion dollar markets and our IP portfolio is becoming more valuable and getting strong validation on the patent front. In addition, many of the larger players in this industry are beginning to recognize and understand the value of our technologies and solutions and we look forward to working with them.""I will now discuss a few key next-generation product products that could generate 8-figure revenues in a few quarters. Some of these products are slated for mass shipping starting in June 2015.The EXPESSvault 3One of the potentially blockbuster new products is the EXPRESSvault 3 (EV3) which is scheduled to start shipments in June 2015.Netlist, a pioneer of NVRAM, has introduced EXPRESSvault EV3 to help address the ever-increasing density of virtual infrastructures and the need for larger databases as a result of an ongoing need for faster storage.To overcome the limitation of current NVDRAM which often requires customized motherboards to implement, Netlist's EXPRESSvault 3 is a plug-and-play card that conveniently fits into a standard PCIe 3.0 x8 lane slot. This eliminates the need for proprietary hardware and extra motherboard space. EXPRESSvault 3 is also designed to ensure that data in memory is immediately and reliably backed up without the use of expensive, inefficient UPS or battery technologies.George Crump, a heavily sought after expert with 25 years of experience designing storage solutions for data centers across the US recently published the article ""Briefing Note: Netlist Readies PCIe Based High Performance NVRAM.""Netlist's Chairman and CEO Chuck Hong commented during the 1Q/FY 2015 conference call:""In April (2015) we introduced the EV3 at the DSI Show in San Jose and since then we have been invited to perfume product demonstrations and add dozens of customers. There's been an overwhelming response from the market to EV3 breakthrough performance. Simply put, in a server or storage system, EV3 provides the fastest medium to write data for indexing, journaling and cashing, critical functions in a data center.At 400,000 IOPS EV3 delivers latency-performance, which is orders of magnitude superior in today's fastest SSDs. The EV3 is based on the industry standard of PCIe3 interface to enable plug-and-play connectivity, making the solution ready to use the day it ships. There are no motherboard or BIOS adjustments that are required and there is no need to rewrite any of the software applications. All of this simplicity will accelerate the products adoption into the market.We are seeing strong interests from major hyper scale customers, storage appliance vendors and server OEMs. We believe EV3 could be $100 million revenue opportunity for Netlist over the next few years. We expect both EV3 (and NV4) to ship in volume starting in the second half of year""CEO Hong mentioned Twitter and Seagate and other potentially large EV3 customers, and gave us an idea of the size of this business:""I don't have the exact numbers for those opportunities but they are significant. And these are mostly sole-source positions. Twitter for their own data centers and Seagate for a company called Xyratex, which they acquired, I believe, last year. We believe they are going to be annually multimillion, pushing towards possibly tens of millions of dollars opportunities, following the second half of the year."""" ...and there are many others companies like SolidFire, which is a big storage manufacture, up-and-coming. We are working very closely with those guys. There are also a number of other storage box vendors, database accelerator systems. There are probably a dozen different opportunities that we are working on. We believe about half a dozen of those will kick in the second half.""LG to include HyperVault in next-generation cellular phonesOn April 28, 2015 Netlist announced that it has signed a letter of intentwith LG to work on a mobile memory controller based on Netlist's HyperVault technology with the intention of using the controller (referred to as HVMMC) in a next generation mobile system. Netlist/LG assert that the solution will lower the density of DRAM (more expensive than NAND flash) without affecting performance. Netlist has also been targeting HyperVault at enterprise applications that could benefit from lower flash latency (by having flash directly on the memory bus), such as transaction processing, analytics, and in-memory databases.During the 4Q/FY 2015 conference call Chuck Hong, Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer commented on this opportunity:""I think it's an enormous opportunity because these guys are among the top mobile phone manufacturers in the world and they are shipping tens of millions of units of phones and potentially it could be very large unit volume, dollar-wise starting in 2016...it's a custom design in of the mobile version of the HyperVault chip into the handsets. It's a long design cycle, but we think starting in 2016, it will be a significant opportunity. This is potentially an eight-figures opportunity.""During the 1Q 2015 conference call CEO Hong added:""We have been in development with HV for the past year and a half and we expect to sample this product at the end of the year. We are excited to welcome LG as a strategic partner and are pleased that other industry players are also starting to recognize the value of our IP. We look forward to creating additional alliances and remain committed and excited about the future of Netlist. ""The Microsoft opportunityOn Februray 13, 2015 Netlist announced that its NVvault NVDIMMmemory solution has been designed into a new server platform for Microsoft's cloud services infrastructure.Netlist's co-founder Chris Lopes stated:""This early work between Microsoft and Netlist has led to defining the specifications now being proposed for future generations of NVDIMMs, as well as customized features such as backup power option using the Netlist's Power Management Unit. We look forward to continuing to work with Microsoft and building off the design and development work to date.""In a recent conference call CEO Hong responded a caller's question about this opportunity as follows:""Well, we are well-positioned. We are one of two suppliers. We believe we are in a lead-supplier position. But the timing of the PO is really function of how they roll out their new server and we don't control that. But currently we expect to see orders later this year, with a significant ramp in 2016.""Update on Netlist's legal frontNetlist has been unfairly categorized as a ""patent troll"" because of its legal battles against much larger competitors like SanDisk, Google, Inphi Corporation, and others. I believe that this is an unfair characterization. Netlist has invested hundreds of millions of dollars developing its memory products since 2000 and its has the right to protect its intellectual property. Typical patent trolls like Document Security Systems (NASDAQ: DSS), Vringo (VRNG), Spherix (NASDAQ:SPEX), ParkerVision Inc. (NASDAQ:PRKR), VirnetX Holding Corp., acquire patents in the open market and then go after potential infringers of those patents.There are several patent-infringement cases waiting for the conclusion of patent re-examinations. Those cases include Diablo Technologies, SanDisk, Google, Inphi and several other alleged infringers. Those fighting the validity of Netlist patents in this highly lucrative and competitive space are not having much luck as time after time these patents are being revalidated by the USPTO.Investors should know that the adverse verdict in the trade secret case against Diablo Technologies (reason for the drop from $1.5 to 50c) has no effect on the patent cases against Diablo and SanDisk (NASDAQ: ). The company expects that the patent cases will move to trial later this year or early next year.As expected, Netlist filed a JMOL (Judgment as a matter of law - a motion made by a party claiming the opposing party has insufficient evidence to reasonably support its case) on May 19, 2015 on the Diablo breach of contract case. The case is scheduled back in court on July 8, 2015 at 2:00 PM for a Motion Hearing.In the JMOL Netlist is requesting a new trial as well as a permanent injunction on Diablo products. It should be noted that Judge Ivonne Gonzales Rogers who oversaw previews proceedings already ruled in favor of Netlist over Diablo in several occasions including an injunction on Diablo products on January 13, 2015.The following are key excerpts of the 20-plus JMOL concluding remarks (Search Pacer case locator, case 4:13-CV-05962 Document 477):The Court had already spoken before trial commenced: Diablo breached the contract. On that basis, the Court issued the Preliminary Injunction. The Court's March 9 Order affirmed that Diablo had no right to use the ID chips, and the trial confirmed that Diablo was in breach. The Court should therefore enter judgment for Netlist on its breach of contract and Section 17200 claims and issue a permanent injunction to remedy Diablo's resulting head start.The Court should also order a new trial on Netlist's trade secret claim. The jury should have been instructed by the Court that Diablo had breached the Supply Agreement. That Diablo breached the agreement should have been the cornerstone, or certainly the starting place for the jury's deliberations. Instead, the opposite occurred.Because the jury was not so instructed, and because the jury was ill-equipped to interpret the contract and resolve a question of law, the jury erroneously concluded that Diablo was not in breach. So, instead of the starting place being that Diablo was in the wrong, the jury started with the premise that Diablo was right. The deliberations, therefore, were infected. Under these circumstances, a new trial is necessary.""ConclusionNetlist is entering a critical phase of new product launches, some of which are potentially blockbusters as mentioned above. The patent fights with Diablo Technologies have completely overshadowed the progress the company has quietly been making on the product front. With almost 50c/share cash and revenues about to ramp significantly starting in the second half of 2015, NLST is grossly undervalued and could easily approach the $3 target set by one of the analysts covering the stock. A positive outcome from the JMOL filed in May 19 and scheduled to be back on court on July 8, 2015 is another potentially huge upside catalyst.Institutions have been increasing their positions on NLST even after the negative outcome of the Diablo jury-trial verdict, possibly expecting positive legal outcomes (new trial or reversal) and/or appreciating the upside offered by the revenue opportunities related to the new next-gen products.Investors are encouraged to do their own due diligence on this or any other stock investment by carefully reviewing company filings with the SEC (10-Ks, etc). There are significant risks investing in NLST stock including: 1) Adverse legal outcomes, 2) delays in bringing products to market, 3) loss of talent to the competition, 4) not able to compete with larger competitors with better financial resources, 5) delisting issues, etc..Disclosure: I am/we are long NLST."
How Reliable Is Dividend Income: A Deep Dive Into S&P 500 Dividend Payers,"Jun. 8, 2015 2:13 PM ET","Can I rely on my dividend income? As a recent convert to the dividend growth portfolio strategy for investing, I am putting my money into dividend growth stocks and will plan on taking out the income in just a few years to partially fund my expenses in retirement. Now that I have oriented my nest egg into a range of dividend growth stocks, how secure should I feel that my income will go up each year, through good investment times and bad? As a corollary to that question, should I plan on withdrawing my entire dividend income each year or should I plan on living on a fixed percentage of this income and just sock the balance away to enhance dividend growth rates and give myself a little buffer just in case the bad times bring dividend income drops? I am a conservative investor; should I also be a conservative dividend income withdrawer?To answer these questions for myself and other dividend growth investors, I decided that I had to better understand the dividend growth behavior of all S&P500 stocks. I limited myself to the S&P since that is where better than 90% of the stocks I own are housed and I suspect that most dividend growth investors look to the US large caps represented in the S&P 500 for their investments. As research for the article, I tabulated all the regular dividends paid for each of the S&P 500 stocks over the past 10 years, from 2005 to 2014. All dividend data came from Charles Schwab and a list of the current 500 stocks in the S&P 500 came from the ETF channel's listings for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY). In what follows, I am only referring to regular dividends. Special dividends are not included.Categorizing the current S&P 500 stocksLet's start with a breakdown of the SPY stocks into categories:"
A Wasted Opportunity,"Dec. 21, 2015 9:31 AM ET","After an absolutely horrible week that came on the heels of an absolutely glorious reaction to the Employment Situation Report just 2 weeks ago, it looked as if some common sense finally had come to the market as the clock was ticking down on the year.After that glorious reaction, the DJIA found itself 0.1% higher on the year, only to see itself sink to 3.1% lower just a week later.But this past Monday, after adding another 100 points to that loss, it all turned around midday and kept going higher right up to and beyond the FOMC Statement release and beyond.By the time the FOMC broke an almost 10-year hiatus on raising interest rates and Janet Yellen finished telling us all that the rate rise wasn't likely to be the only one in the coming year, the market had embraced the news and taken the index to a point that it was almost 0.5% higher on the year.That's not much after nearly a year's work, but it's better than some of the alternatives.Strong buying heading into the widely expected FOMC announcement looked as if it was an attempt to capitalize on what was expected to be a strong year-end rally as the interest rate overhang was finally coming to its end.There's nothing more American than trying to foresee and then take advantage of an opportunity and to then create a ""feel good"" story, by using the final trading days of the year to bring some glory to a year that the net change had done little justice towards portraying the wild activity seen."

Netlist Deal With Samsung Validates The Technology And Is Just The Start Of Future Deals,Nov.20.15,"Netlist, Inc (NASDAQ:NLST), a provider of memory subsystems, announced it has entered into a joint development and license agreement with Samsung. In this partnership, NLST and Samsung will produce a new class of NVDIMM-P memory solutions. While the stock is up 50% on the news, we believe the long-term implications of the deal are far more significant than that.The most significant part of this deal for investors is that it validates NLST LRDIMM technology and proves that they own the IP for this transformational technology going forward. While the company has been saying this for some time, investors have been waiting to see some traction in the market. Prior to the deal, NLST was a $25 million market cap company. Anytime a company of that size is able to strike a licensing and development deal with a company like Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), which is the industry's largest memory provider, it's a clear validation of the product, and shows the importance of this IP in the memory market going forward.The validation and demand for the technology lead us to the second point of significance for this deal, which is that other industry players, specifically Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU), could be looking to license this technology from NLST in order to keep pace with Samsung, and with Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) 3D XPoint technology. We believe 3D XPoint is the reason Samsung signed this deal with NLST, and is the reason other competitors will follow suit. However, unlike the Samsung deal, going forward, NLST will be able to negotiate from a position of strength. While the Samsung deal is a huge win for the company, they didn't have much negotiating power as a micro-cap company licensing technology that had yet to gain significant traction in the memory market."
Micron: A Growth Stock For A Deep Value Price,Jul. 9.15,"Micron (NASDAQ:MU) sells memory chips: DRAM chips and NAND chips. The latter type of chips will replace hard disks soon. As a matter of fact, the next computer I will buy will be one without a hard disk. Such computers are faster, more reliable and use less power. Such a replacement would already make sense for me. However, I usually wait as long as possible to replace my laptop, as it takes time to buy and install a new one. But apart from these non-financial switching costs, replacing your hard disk PC or laptop with one with solid-state memory makes sense already. Imagine everyone replacing his or her hard disk in the next couple of years!Of course, I could just swap the hard disk in my old laptop with new solid-state memory. Many people have done that already. That would be the cheapest solution for me. But why would I invest my time to end up with the same old and slow processor? Because of these hidden switching costs, many people will replace their laptop or desktop instead of just the hard disk. These new computers will need new DRAM as well. As a result, the demand for Micron's other product, DRAM, will surge.Disruptive TechnologySo Micron produces disruptive products that will replace all hard disks: NAND chips. Keep in mind that hard disks are used by consumers for over 20 years. But that's not all. Recent articles on Seeking Alpha show that the company is very likely to own essential intellectual property for the production of Phase Change Memory, or PCM. These chips might be as fast as normal DRAM memory, but keep their digital contents when power is switched off. See here and especially here. There are many ways to improve computers with these chips."
"Micron, SanDisk, SK Hynix: Why Is Samsung Building A $23 Billion Fab?",Sep. 6.15,"There are six major companies involved in the manufacturing of memory (DRAM and NAND). These are Micron (NASDAQ:MU), SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF), SanDisk (SNDK), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF). Toshiba and SanDisk jointly develop and produce NAND. Intel and Micron have a joint venture that builds 3D NAND (and soon 3D XPoint). For the purpose of this discussion, I will think of Toshiba and SanDisk as just SanDisk, and I will think of Intel and Micron as just Micron.There are two main types of memory in use today: DRAM and NAND. Micron, SK Hynix and Samsung produce the majority of the world's supply of DRAM. These three companies along with SanDisk produce the bulk of the world's NAND supply. Since the beginning of the year, the four stocks have fallen out of favor. There has been a steady stream of downgrades from investment banks for all of these companies over the last several months. The earnings estimates seem to continuously fall. The reason most often cited seems to be that supply exceeds demand. If this is true, why are all four memory manufacturers making capital expenditures to build new fabs or expand existing ones?While the amount of capacity being added at each of the four memory manufacturers varies quite a bit, the biggest spender over the next 2-3 years is clearly going to be Samsung. Samsung is currently planning on investing over $23 billion on a new fab that could begin producing wafers by 2017. Originally, the company had planned on building that fab for $14.4 billion. That fab was supposed to be able to build 300,000 300 mm wafers per month. If the extra $9.2 billion spent is to further expand capacity, this new fab would have an additional 192,000 wafers per month of capacity. In total, this new ultra-large fab could produce close to 500,000 wafers per month, which equates to 6 million wafers per year. To put that number in perspective, let's look at the total 300 mm wafer capacity of the big four memory manufacturers as of December 2014. Samsung had a capacity of 985,000 wafers per month. Micron had a capacity of 627,000 wafers per month. SanDisk had a capacity of 525,000 wafers per month. SK Hynix had a capacity of 470,000 wafers per month. Samsung's 300 mm wafer capacity includes the portion of wafers it uses to build logic chips. The amount of capacity Samsung is building is roughly equivalent to that of SanDisk or SK Hynix. To summarize, this is a huge fab with a lot of capacity."
"The Ideal Acquisition For Apple Is Micron, Not Tesla",Nov.10.15,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most recognized name in the world of electronics. The path to glory was extremely bumpy for the first two decades. That all changed with the release of the original iPod in October 2001. The story of AAPL's meteoric rise from that time to today and Steve Jobs reaching icon status through his role in establishing the iPhone and iPad as the dominant forces in smartphones and tablets is well documented. With the success of Apple over the last fourteen years, the company has created a balance sheet with an enormous amount of cash. While excessive amounts of cash on a balance sheet can put a damper on the potential return for its investors, it is an enviable problem to have.What can Apple do to alleviate the cash drag on its stock performance? The ideal use of cash is to spend it on new projects that will expand the firm's reach and increase profitability to new heights. Apple is famously secretive about the products it is developing. However, the firm's reported interest in building Apple-branded electric automobiles is difficult to dispute. This is just one of what is likely a rather large list of projects that it is currently working on. Even with the future R&D and capital expenditures needed for these projects, there is still a significant amount of excess cash (well over $100 billion) sitting on the balance sheet."
Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund Just Keeps Chugging Along,Jul.28.15,"Overall Objective and StrategyThe primary objective of Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund (MUTF:FLPSX) is to seek capital appreciation by investing 80% of its assets in low-priced stocks (at or below $35), which often leads to investments in small- and mid-cap securities. It invests in both growth and value stocks.The fund looks for high-quality, growing companies that trade at bargain prices - e.g. companies with strong balance sheets and good free cash flow yield. Joel Tillinghast, who has managed the fund for over 25 years, has been quoted as saying ""I'm only interested in stocks selling for 12 or 14 times earnings or less.""Fund ExpensesThe expense ratio for FLPSX is 0.82%, which is reasonable for a well-managed, global equity fund.

Intel And Solid State Drives: A Winning Strategy,Dec. 3.15,"Several months ago I wrote an article outlining the tremendous opportunity Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) faces in the non-volatile memory market (NAND storage) and more specifically in solid state drives (SSD).It's no secret that Intel has faced several headwinds during the past few years. PC sales are stagnating, and with them chip sales to PC OEMs. Intel's efforts to win substantial share in the mobile processor market also hit a brick wall. First Intel missed the mobile train. Then it paid heavy subsidies to win market share in the tablet market, a strategy that backfired when tablet sales suddenly began to decline roughly 18 months ago.Thus, despite putting enormous resources into penetrating the tablet market, Intel enjoyed only a short-term increase in mobile sales. Without growth, its mobile business is having a hard time turning a profit.With these headwinds in mind, let's quantify Intel's opportunity in the SSD market.The OpportunityIntel needs to grow profitably. In order to secure its long-term future, it has to build on its expertise in manufacturing integrated circuits (ICs).In the previous article, I identified the SSD market as one that Intel has a high probability of winning.Just like the HDD market, the SSD market will go through a consolidation phase.Source: WikipediaThe following image breaks down SSD market share:"
Thin Film Electronics: Printed Electronics IoT Company Going To Market,Sep.25.15,"Executive SummaryThin Film Electronics (OTCQX:TFECF) specializes in polymer- and organic-based printed electronics, focusing on memory and logic. Furthermore, the company is a roll-to-roll manufacturing leader, using this technology to mass-produce its devices. Thin Film Electronics is the first company in the world to commercialize printed rewritable memory. Based in Oslo, it has primary locations in Linköping (Sweden) and San Jose and holds around 280 patents. Specializing in low-cost IoT (Internet of Things) applications, its printed smart tags are at least 95% cheaper than silicon equivalents. Valuing this company is challenging since it does not have earnings and the market for IoT is still new. The company trades at an enormous premium compared to its peer group. However, key ratios may not tell the whole story, considering the management and market potential.After interviewing Dr. Davor Sutija (CEO) and exchanging emails with John Afzelius-Jenevall (CFO), I believe that this company has the ""right stuff"" to succeed. They demonstrated transparency, precision and character essential to lead an evolving company. The financials, debt-free standing and strong cash position further affirm that they are responsible managers. The other executives are a mix of mature scientists and business people, experienced in overcoming obstacles and dealing with setbacks. Validating the observation, they adapted after photovoltaic and flexible screen applications did not materialize. This was the primary use case during the early 2000s."
"Fairchild Semi: What It's Worth, SanDisk May Be Bought",Oct.16.15,"On Wednesday afternoon Bloomberg reported that Fairchild (FCS) had hired Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to help pursue a sale of the company, with both Infineon (OTCQX:IFNNF) and On Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) as potential suitors. On Fairchild Semiconductor's 3Q earnings call today, following lengthy opening remarks, the elephant in the room quickly emerged. Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore asked about potential M&A:Source: Fairchild 3Q conference call transcriptWhile we respect Mr. Thompson, in our years on the Street, we have heard many companies make ""comments on this stuff"" - often saying things like: ""for the foreseeable future we plan on executing on our strategy and going it alone"" or ""we have no current M&A plans, but should a compelling offer come, we'd have to consider it."" In our opinion a no comment is a huge comment and we believe that Fairchild is very much in play. So the question is: What's it worth?3Q results and the 4Q outlook were not much to get excited about. 3Q was in-line with the company's negative pre-announcement, while 4Q revenue guidance was in-line, while gross margin guidance was slightly below the street. However there appear to be some one-time factors involved. Specifically, the company built up some excess inventory to ensure a reliable source of supply in case of any challenges as they shift to a higher percentage of outsourcing. In addition, they still have employees (included in COGS) working on plant closures. As a result of underutilization, the company's gross margin will be 32.5%-33.5% in 4Q, down from 34.1% in 3Q (and similar in 1Q)."
From Bad To Worse: Seagate,Apr.14.16,"Last night Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) preannounced its fiscal third quarter results. They were, in a word, awful. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $2.6B versus guidance of $2.7B. The $2.7B is down from previous street expectations of $2.8B just 90 days ago. $2.6B in Q3 revenues represent a 21.9% decline on a year-over-year basis, which is an acceleration from the Q2 decline of 19.2%. Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 23% versus guidance for 25.6% and previous margin of 24.8%. Total drives sold fell to 39M units, down a whopping 15% from the previous quarter. The total addressable market or TAM for HDDs is declining at an alarming rate. Shares are crashing so far this morning, down 18% at the moment.What's Happening?Seagate is experiencing weakness across its product portfolio. In the press release, it cited reduced demand for mission critical HDD enterprise products, storage arrays, SSDs and client desktop and notebook drives. We knew client would be weak, but the weakness in mission critical enterprise drives is particularly concerning for the bulls as enterprise is always what they point to as the savior for the company. The fact of the matter is that SSDs are coming for the enterprise business quicker than most expected. When storage array makers EMC (EMC), NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) report later this earnings season, I expect them to report large increases in all-flash arrays (70-100%) and modest declines in traditional HDD storage arrays as this has been the pattern in recent quarters. Also concerning for the bulls was the weakness the company pointed to in its silicon products, aka SSDs. As I have stated before, competition in enterprise SSDs is intense, and without its own silicon Seagate is at a pricing disadvantage. Anyone thinking SSDs will save Seagate will likely end up being sorely disappointed."
"Western Digital Is Cheap, But Seagate Is In Trouble",May. 9.16,"The slow rise in the uptake of solid-state drives should not surprise investors. Prices for 120GB and 240GB sizes dropped by at least half, making them suitable replacements for mechanical hard disks (""HDDs""). Combined with free cloud storage from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and iCloud, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and OneDrive, Dropbox, Box (NYSE:BOX), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Drive, consumers no longer need lots of space. This trend is especially troubling for HDD makers, notably Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ:STX). Western Digital's bold move in acquiring SanDisk gives the company an edge over Seagate.STX)"" hspace=""6"" vspace=""6"">Buying Western Digital and selling or betting against Seagate Technologies may make the most sense.Seagate managed to lower inventory sequentially by 11 percent in its third quarter. Gross margin stood at 23 percent, but the company faced troubling trends. Weak shipments of 39.2 million units hurt revenue, but Seagate offset the negative impact by raising prices. Falling shipments for PCs in the first quarter this year now makes it six consecutive quarters in a row.Seagate has room to cut costs to sustain its generous 13.2 percent dividend yield. Income investors should learn from high yield investing in deep-water drilling and oil sectors. When prices fell sharply, companies could no longer sustain its dividend. Seagate has room to cut capex by nearly 30 percent to $535 million. Beyond this year, if demand does not improve and prices erode, expect a dividend cut.Western Digital's acquisition of SanDisk should give it an edge over Seagate. The higher debt level is manageable. It also sports a higher operating margin than Seagate:STX Operating Margin (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsSeagate's acquisition of Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) hard disk division in 2011 for $1.375 billion, along with its slow move into the SSD market will prove a fatal move for the company. If it partners with Samsung in adapting Samsung's NAND technology, it might give Seagate some hope in catching up.Markets are equally bearish on Seagate and Western Digital. Short float is similar between the two at around 13 percent, but this is an inefficient assessment for Western Digital. Under HGST, WDC offers reliable archiving solutions. WDC owns the SAS (serial attached) SSD market through HGST. Its ownership of SanDisks R&D and patents should give Western Digital a sizable lead over any other competitor in the SAS SSD space.New PCs and notebooks will eventually adopt SSDs as the primary drive. If Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), Dell, and other manufacturers abolish secondary HDDs due to ability of free cloud storage, Seagate will suffer more than Western Digital in lower sales.Poor reliabilityWhereas HGST drives suffered failure rates no higher than 3 percent, some Seagate drives suffered failure rates in the 220 percent range in the case of the Seagate Barracuda Green drive (1TB).TakeawayBoth Seagate and Western Digital face headwinds in the hard disk market, but Seagate's poor reliability, unsustainable dividend, and lack of a solid-state disk road map will continuing hurting its share price. Getting bullish on WDC and bearish on Seagate might be the move to make.Thank you for reading this article.

Seagate And Western Digital Could Soon Have A True Duopoly In HDDs,Jan.22.16,"There are only three players in the hard disk drive (HDD) market: Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY). Using information provided by both Seagate and Western Digital in their quarterly reports and International Data Corporation, we can parse out market share for each company.Each company's market share has been pretty static for the past few years, +/- 1.5 percentage points. On a revenue basis, Toshiba only garnered 13.8% market share in Q3 2015 according to IDC data.It is no secret that Toshiba is reeling from a major accounting scandal this year that saw the CEO and several senior officials resign. Profits were overstated by $1.2B over a seven-year period. The company is forecasting a massive loss this year, has cancelled its dividend and is financing its operations by raising billions in debt. I looked into Toshiba's product line-up in HDDs - particularly its enterprise offerings. It pales in comparison to Western Digital and Seagate's offerings. It shows up in the operating performance. Here is a chart compiled by Bloomberg of data put out by IDC."
10% Yield Play On Seagate,Apr.27.16,"Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is down 55% year over year:While this now gives STX holders a wild dividend of 10%, it also drives fear into the hearts of investors grasping STX with hopes of a comeback. Buying into a stock that has a 10% yield at the outset is vastly different from watching a stock lose half its value yet pay the same dividends as before. Some are speculating that STX will even cut its dividend, halting its 13 consecutive years of dividend increases (barring a hiccup in 2009).No matter what, the future of STX lies in whether its product becomes obsolete. For STX, the biggest threat is flash will overtake HDD. The transition is possibly already underway, as STX sales have dropped, with customers turning to alternative, flash storage methods.The key triggers of choosing a storage medium relate to cost, speed, and storage. And much like finding the right mate, in this area it's a ""choose two paradigm"": ""cheap,"" ""fast,"" and ""large."" (For choosing a mate, of course, your choices are ""attractive,"" ""fun,"" and ""sane."")For HDD, you have large and cheap. For flash, you have fast and large. Flash is becoming increasingly cheaper, both in acquisition and in operation:"
Seagate: Don't Fall For This Dividend Yield Trap,May. 2.16,"Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) reported Q3 earnings Friday and the results were below expectations. Considering expectations were already at rock bottom in light of the company's Q3 warning it issued on April 13th, the report is especially disappointing. After the warning, STX shares lost about 20% of their value, and after this earnings report, STX shares again lost nearly 20% of their value.STX data by YChartsAll of these declines have brought STX down to a price range the stock hasn't seen since the beginning of 2012. Looking at Seagate's financials, it is not difficult to see why the stock has taken such a beating. Revenue for Q3 was $2.6 billion, which is a 21% year-over-year (""YoY"") decline from Q3 2015. Assuming Seagate matches its Q4 guidance and earns revenue of $2.3 billion, that would be full-year 2016 revenue of $10.8 billion. That equates to a YoY decline in annual revenue of 21%. For that kind of revenue deterioration in just one year, I think STX deserved the pummeling it got.Anyone who follows Seagate knows why revenue is dropping off so steeply: PC demand is still weak and falling, and hard disk drives are being cannibalized by solid state drives. While Seagate Technology has sat on its hands as its primary market deteriorates, its main competitor Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) went out and bought flash memory manufacturer SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) to lessen Western's dependence on the declining HDD market."
Seagate Technology: Buy It And Hold On,May. 6.16,"If your investment horizon is three years or longer (and if it's not, you shouldn't be buying stocks anyway), you need to consider adding Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX) to your portfolio. Seagate is one of the world's largest manufacturers of hard drives used to store data in personal computers. This is the main reason the stock is out of favor. But I believe that STX will reward the patient investor who can tolerate a little volatility and ignore the noise surrounding the company.Now, there's no question that the stock has been in a virtual free fall since January 2015, and technically it looks terrible. Take a look at the chart below. It isn't pretty. So, at least in the very short term, it looks as if the path of least resistance is to go lower.Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comNevertheless, the stock looks attractive to me in the range where it's trading now. I'll get to that later. For now, let's focus on the issues currently hanging over STX and what's driving the stock lower.The first issue is lower forecasted PC demand. The market is viewing STX as a proxy for PC sales. And, clearly, demand for the old personal computer is waning. Smartphones, tablets and other portable gadgets have all the computing power of a PC but are less expensive and a heck of a lot easier to carry around. As a result, sales of personal computers (desktops and laptops alike) have been declining every year since 2011 when worldwide shipments topped out at 364 million units. Annual shipments have slipped by nearly 24% since then. According to data compiled by Statista, for the year ended 12/31/2015, worldwide PC shipments totaled fewer than 277 million units. And analysts expect that trend to continue through 2016. Industry data show that PC sales are forecast to fall an additional 6.0% or so this year. And, logically, lower PC sales mean lower shipments of hard drives to those manufacturers."
What The Options Market Is Telling Us About Seagate's Dividend,Apr.18.16,"Over the past few months, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) has faced a severe stock price decline.Below is STX's 12-month performance. (The chart as provided by FINRA).Over the past 12 months, STX's stock hit a 52-week high of $60.09 and a 52-week low of $25.54 (intra day stock price on 04/15/2016) - this represents a roughly 58% drop in STX's stock price. Interestingly, STX managed to raise its dividend, in November, from $.54 to $.63. Between STX's dividend increase and STX's stock price decline, STX now sports a very large 9.85% yield ($2.52/$25.59). STX's large dividend has recently garnered the attention of investors seeking yield. However, given STX's decline, I believe it is important for potential investors to take into account the possibility STX will cut its dividend. One objective way to gauge the probability of a company cutting its dividend is by using the options market to estimate implied dividend payments. The options implied dividend is basically the average dividend payment expectation of all option traders at a moment in time. Given the high level of institutional involvement in the options market, the implied dividend also can be seen as the dividend expectations of large institutions.It is also important to note STX's 2023, 2025 and 2034 bonds are all trading above 8.5% YTM as of 04/14/2016. According to data provided by FRED, junk bond yields are trading at an over the treasury yield curve - about 6.62% as of 04/15/2016. Based on these OAS figures, it is safe to say STX bonds are currently in junk territory even though they are currently rated as investment grade by the rating agencies. High bond rates make it difficult for management teams to fund and justify dividends."
Dissecting The Cycles In Data Storage: An Investment Thesis For Seagate,Mar.17.16,"In his classic analysis ""Business Cycles,"" Joseph Schumpeter steps the reader through the evolution of a number of business cycles. His major theme is that economic growth is driven by cycles of technological innovation. As a particular innovation begins, it results in slow growth as the new technologies take hold. As the same cycle matures, growth peaks (sometimes decades later), and it frequently ends in a price bubble. The ebb and flow of separate cycles cause huge amounts of confusion in markets. In order to understand how a market might evolve, it is necessary to analyze each technology cycle independently. Schumpeter (who coined the phrase ""creative destruction"") goes on to argue that technologies or markets rarely change discontinuously. Instead, they evolve in a way that reflects the basic economics of the time. It is the entrepreneurs who figure out how to adapt available technologies within their current economic circumstances to meet the needs of the marketplace.A Secular Trend Hidden by the Confluence of Two CyclesThe ""PC industry"" is undergoing a tremendous shift to what is called ""cloud computing."" This transition is the largest since the PC caused the move away from mainframe computing. At its core, ""cloud computing"" is nothing more than having access to one's data and files from anywhere, at any time, through any device. For the data to be available, it has to be stored in an accessible place. This process represents a huge opportunity for some of the companies in the PC supply chain, particularly those that supply data storage products. However, the transition to this new landscape is being complicated by two other distinct, but related cycles:"
Hutchinson Technology: Misinformation About TDK Walk-Away Date Creates A Buying Opportunity,May.11.16,"Last week, a negative article was written about Hutchinson Technologies (NASDAQ:HTCH) transaction to be acquired by TDK (OTCPK:TTDKY) for to $4.00 per share by arbjournal.com. I can't link to the article because its subscription only, but the basis of the negative article this time is that the walk-away date for TDK to pull away from the deal is May 2nd, 2016. Although this date was originally true, if one reads the detail of definitive merger agreement (DMA) you would learn that the TDK walk-away date is now November of 2016 since only FTC approval remains. Basically, the agreement says that if only FTC or CFIUS approval remains, then the walk-away date for TKD extends to November of 2016. HTCH already has CFIUS approval, so now only FTC approval remains. Please see page 67, section 11.03 (a) for confirmation. If you want further confirmation, I am sure HTCH's investor relations contact can confirm it for you. I wish the arbjournal.com blogger would have done this prior to putting out two misleading blogs in a row.Another factor that gives us confidence in receiving $4 per share in cash is that HTCH reported their Q1 earnings on April 27 an Industry giants Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NYSE:WDC) support the deal, we see no reason approval won't occur and they reiterated their belief that they expected the deal to close no later than the second quarter of 2016. This management team is very conservative and if they had any doubts that the timing of the deal was slipping, this was their opportunity to tell investors. Rather, they confirmed the timeline and their previous guidance. Plus, HTCH had 47.9 million in cash at quarter end, so they are well above the required $35 million to get the full $4.00 per share."
5 Undervalued Companies For Value Investors With A High Beta - January 2016,"Jan. 31, 2016 3:33 AM ET","There are a number of great companies in the market today. By using the ModernGraham Valuation Model, I've selected the five undervalued companies for value investors reviewed by ModernGraham with the highest beta.A company's beta indicates the correlation at which its price moves in relation to the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates a company is more volatile than the market.Each company has been determined to be suitable for either the Defensive Investor or the Enterprising Investor according to the ModernGraham approach. Defensive Investors are defined as investors who are not able or willing to do substantial research into individual investments, and therefore need to select only the companies that present the least amount of risk. Enterprising Investors, on the other hand, are able to do substantial research and can select companies that present a moderate (though still low) amount of risk.With a high beta, Mr. Market may turn these companies around very quickly, so be sure to check them out in depth!Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX)Seagate Technology PLC qualifies for the Enterprising Investor but not the more conservative Defensive Investor. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the insufficient earnings growth or stability over the last ten years, the low current ratio, and the inconsistent dividend record. The Enterprising Investor is only initially concerned by the level of debt relative to the net current assets. As a result, all Enterprising Investors following the ModernGraham approach based on Benjamin Graham's methods should feel comfortable proceeding with further research into the company.As for a valuation, the company appears to be undervalued after growing its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $2.39 in 2012 to an estimated $4.14 for 2016. This level of demonstrated earnings growth outpaces the market's implied estimate of 0.9% annual earnings loss over the next 7-10 years. As a result, the ModernGraham valuation model, based on Benjamin Graham's formula, returns an estimate of intrinsic value above the price. (See the full valuation)"
Western Digital: Time To Be Optimistic,May.13.16,"Western Digital (NYSE:WDC)-the leading Hard Disk Drive (HDD) maker-has been feeling the pressure in the past 12 months due to an accelerated decline in PC sales and increased adoption of Solid State Drive (SSD). Last year, the company acquired SanDisk, an SSD maker, to diversify its business. The market thought that Western Digital paid an unjustifiably high price for SanDisk at a time when the competition in the SSD market was heating up due to 3-D NAND technology. The company's stock price declined from $100 to $37. However, this acquisition has the potential to fundamentally change the risk profile of WDC in the impending technology shift. Despite short-term headwinds, the storage market will grow in the long term and Western Digital is best positioned to benefit.Investment ThesisBefore acquisition, a dominant player in a declining HDD marketThe HDD market came a long way via consolidation to reach the state of trioploy in 2012. Western Digital (43%), Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) (42%), and Toshiba (15%) have since maintained a balanced market and earned decent returns. During this period, Western Digital achieved a 28%/22% Gross/EBITDA margin and maintained an average ROIC of 14%. However, nothing is static in technology, especially for commoditized hardware. The emergence of SSD has slowly intruded into the HDD market. The development of 3-D NAND may further lower the cost of SSD and break the balance in the HDD trioploy.An underestimated acquisition that changed the competitive landscapeAlthough the acquisition of SanDisk may appear to be expensive, it completely changed Western Digital's risk profile. Of the three storage technologies, the new Western Digital's products are the leaders in HDD and planar SSD. The company is also fighting in the new 3-D NAND development. Before the acquisition, there was a risk that the success of 3-D NAND would permanently shrink Western Digital's addressable market. Now, however, Western Digital's technology portfolio ensures that it can prosper under all scenarios. Moreover, Toshiba's small share in the HDD market and joint venture with SanDisk will provide it with an incentive to improve its cooperation with Western Digital and this will put pressure on pure players like Seagate."
"Micron, Intel And 3D NAND Post 2016 - Is That All There Is?",Feb.29.16,"Is that all there is?Is that all there is?If that's all there is my friendsThen let's keep dancingLet's break out the booze and have a ballIf that's all there is.- Jerry Leiber and Mike StollerFY 2016 will be disappointing for Micron (NASDAQ:MU) investors with the DRAM business experiencing what is shaping up to be unrelenting weak market demand. When that is coupled with continuing oversupply pressures, this time from Micron rather than Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), the result is unlikely to be positive. Our last article concluded that there was little to be expected from the NAND business either - for Micron at any rate.Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will be a far different story. The company won't be seeing a lot of volume from the Micron Fab 10X expansion and its own Dalian plant, but what volume it does get it'll get top dollar for in the enterprise/data center market that it dominates. It has the NVMe controller expertise to capitalize on as it brings to market a new series of TLC-based 3D NAND SSDs in the back half of 2016 that will likely set new records for throughput, endurance, and latency in the most demanding applications.Micron will achieve some success with partners like Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) bringing SAS-based SSDs into more conservative and cost-sensitive enterprise environments, so that's worth something, but whether or not they can successfully market their own branded SSD product (from the Seagate partnership) is still to be proven. Whatever their limited success this year, the key to the great game of NAND is 2017 and beyond through the balance of the decade. It is to that topic that we now turn.In our last article, we opined that it is likely that the IM partners will have a quantifiable cost advantage with their floating gate-based 3D NAND design by late this year. Despite Samsung holding almost a 19% density advantage with its 256Gb 48L TLC product, it has not been shy about positioning its technology aggressively. The central claim has been most vociferously voiced by Intel - to wit, the technology will scale on a Moore's Law basis, doubling the bits every two years. Micron is also very bullish. Listen to Micron's VP of Technology, Scott DeBoer, at the 2015 Summer Analysts Conference:"
It's Only Embarrassing If You Try To Avoid Embarrassment,"Apr. 24, 2016 3:27 PM ET","Most of us can recall a time when we were embarrassed, unless your need for denial is stronger than your memory.It's probably much worse when there are a lot of people around as witnesses.It may be even worse if your antics are under embargo, finally being released at 2 PM, say on a Wednesday, and then really called into question the following day with the planned release of the GDP.There's nothing like being under the spotlight, especially when purposefully bringing attention to yourself and then somehow messing up.I imagine, that even as poised and calm as she appears as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, a young Janet Yellen may have been as easily subject to embarrassment as a child as any of us.Obviously, I also imagine that the hairdo hasn't changed over the years.Of course, it could be really helpful to know what the actual GDP statistic will be and having your performance altered to meet the demands of reality.This coming week has an FOMC Statement release which is followed barely 20 hours later by news of the GDP for the first quarter of 2016.As the FOMC meeting gets underway on Tuesday, there is no doubt awareness of the consensus calling for lackluster GDP growth and the Atlanta Federal Reserve's own decreased estimate just a few weeks ago.One would think that with some strong sense of what the data really happens to be, the chances of embarrassing one's self by taking the opportunity to announce an interest rate increase at this coming week's FOMC meeting would be very small."
A Contrarian Take On The Hard Drive Debate,"Apr. 11, 2016 5:20 PM ET","I reached a milestone recently, having completed the backup of my data into the cloud. It took months to deliver the hundreds of gigabytes to the invisible (to me) data centers that comprise the cloud and it got me thinking about data storage - namely the future of HDDs and SSDs - and the manufacturers of storage technologies - primarily Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX).Hard drive makers Western Digital and Seagate have seen their stock prices crushed since the beginning of 2015: Western Digital is down about 60%, Seagate, about 50%. The purported reasons are many, from decreasing PC demand to the rise of solid state hard drives (SSDs). But it was my own experience with storage that got me to think about the HDD/SSD debate in a different light.For the record, I will refer to both HDDs and SSDs as hard drives, even though I'm pretty sure it is technically not a proper term for SSDs. To the true techies, I apologize in advance.Data, data everywhereRegardless of your loyalties in the HDD/SSD debate, I think we can all agree that data creation is expanding.According to IBM (NYSE:IBM), 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are generated every day. Quintillion is one of those multipliers that is so large that it loses all meaning. 2.5 quintillion bytes is 2.5 exabytes (another figure that has no meaning) or 2.5 million terabytes. Now we have reached a multiplier that I know: terabyte. 2.5 million of them is a lot."
Western Digital Stock Is A Contrarian Value Play,May. 4.16,"Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) has been feeling the heat as the hard disk drive (""HDD"") market continues to decline on weak PC demand. To combat this pressure, Western Digital made the decision to acquire flash memory manufacturer SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) in order to diversify out of the HDD market and put itself in a position for some growth in the future.I recently wrote an article on Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), which has decided not to reposition its business by making any significant moves. Instead Seagate has decided to tread water and hope for a rebound in HDDs. Not likely to happen. Western Digital's direction is much more promising for investors.(Source: WDC/SNDK Headquarters)There will be some significant growing pains from the SanDisk acquisition considering there are very few synergies between the two companies, but in the long run it was a move that Western Digital needed to make in order to survive. For investors with a short-term investing horizon, WDC is likely not a stock in which you want invest. HDD revenues will continue to decline and will be partially offset by SanDisk's contributions. The result of this mixing of different businesses will likely be a big ol' mess.As you may recall, when Western Digital initially announced its acquisition of SanDisk, many investors believed that the former was overpaying. However, there were really no other viable options available. It was either make an acquisition to pivot towards the SSD market or follow Seagate's path and pay dividends until the company goes underwater.For the sake of WDC investors, I'm glad the company chose to adapt instead of to die. A few years down the road, WDC will have a leveled-off, small HDD segment to serve the vestiges of the dying industry and a newfound focus on SSDs. If the transition is successful, WDC could have significant upside for long-term horizon investors.Over the course of that transition, investors will receive a nice 4.9% yield that Western Digital can still play handily for a while, unlike Seagate. And after the transition is complete, investors can look forward to a company that will be a big player in the SSD market; SanDisk is the third-largest flash memory manufacturer in the world.The SanDisk acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter as the deal is still awaiting Chinese regulatory approval. In all likelihood, the deal will go through and Western Digital will be a bit clunky as an organization for a while but will eventually come out as a company with potential upside and an avenue for growth.However, we must also weigh the risks here. In order to acquire SanDisk, Western Digital is issuing $14.1 billion in debt. This should not be a significant issue considering both Western Digital and SanDisk record plenty of free cash flow, but I will be watching the combined entity closely to see if management makes paying down the debt a top priority, which I hope they do.Regardless, there are still certainly quite a few risks involved in investing in WDC and risk-averse investors should likely look elsewhere for value. Long-term investors however might want to take a look at WDC after the SanDisk acquisition and determine if the upside potential outweighs the risks. I will be doing the same, and at this point in time I am leaning towards buying a small position after the acquisition closes.My question to you, the reader, is:What are your thoughts on WDC's acquisition of SanDisk? Was it the right idea, but the wrong move? Did they overpay? Was it the only move?

Marvell Technology: Half Of It Is Cash.,May.13.16,"IntroductionMarvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) (""Marvell"") is a hidden gem, an outstanding business possessing enormous cash inside, but having no debt. Starboard Value LP, the activist investor, bought a stake on February 2016 to make the company reconsider its capital allocation strategy. If this investor succeeds, the stock price should definitely increase.In this article, I will analyze the capital structure of Marvell as well as the value that could be unlocked for the shareholders.Business of Marvell TechnologyMarvell was incorporated in Bermuda in 1996. It is fabless semiconductor provider. It is worth mentioning here that we had a wave of M&As between this kind of companies a few months ago. I wrote several articles about this wave, maybe the most profitable was this one.The company sells mobile and wireless, storage, and networking devices. It sells its devices to a relatively small number of end customers, such as Western Digital, Seagate and Toshiba, and to a distributor namely Wintech. All these are big names in the industry.The R&D expenses are very important for this company. It expenses almost half of its total revenue in it. The company has been extremely successful in doing this, and the amount of intangible assets in the balance sheet is incredible. In the 10-K, the management talks about it like this:""As of January 31, 2015, we have been issued and/or have acquired over 5,300 U.S. patents and over 1,400 foreign patents with expiration dates ranging from 2015 to 2035. We also have more than 3,800 U.S. and foreign pending patent applications on various aspects of our technology.""Revenue, Cash Flow and EBITDASince 1996, the revenue has been growing quite a bit. As mentioned earlier, these people are doing a great job. In fiscal year 2015, the net revenue was $3.7 billion, 9% higher than that of 2014. They have been doing this for many years. To verify this factor, please have a look at the following chart:"
The Years Of Magical Thinking: The NAND Industry Confronts The Problem Of Demand Growth,Apr.20.16,"Magical thinking is a form of reasoning that learns causative relationships through correlation alone. Science and the scientific method are designed to elucidate causal relationships through careful controlled experiments; magical thinking, given a correlation with an observed effect, pulls a causation out of thin air.We look at the NAND business as a business that can have significant growth, but also has some interesting demand elasticity properties. - Mark Durcan - Credit Suisse Technology Conference Dec. 3, 2014... we think with 3D it will be the tipping point that will eventually allow the PC space to convert 100% to SSDs. - SA Transcripts, Micron's Ernie Maddock - Raymond James Technology Conference 2015In the last two articles, we have taken a hard look at the NAND business in 2016 and beyond. We have concluded that Micron (NASDAQ:MU) will see only a little benefit from the business in 2016, but can potentially harvest revenue and profit gains in 2017 and beyond if demand growth exceeds 35%. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is in much better shape because of its dominance of the data center. Because of that dominant position, Intel will likely see strong revenue and profit gains in 2016 and beyond into 2017 and 2018, assuming adequate demand growth. Depending on the overall market conditions, Intel is in a strong position to be the primary beneficiary of the innovative and cost-leading 3D NAND technology that the IM partners are now bringing to market.But what will those market conditions be? Questions regarding the economic viability of this new generation of 3D NAND product inevitably devolve to the question of demand. It would seem obvious that for a market aspiring to overall revenue and profit growth, demand growth must exceed the rise in productivity. In this case, if the capacity increases in the new 3D technology fall in the 35-40% per year range, overall market demand must exceed that level for there to be gross margin expansion."
Impacts From SanDisk/Western Digital Merger For Long-Term Value Investors,Mar.28.16,"This article was written by Bernardo Teixeira and Sam Frazier from the NU Student Value Fund.Over the years Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), along with many other computer driven storage companies, has suffered a huge HDD market drop due to the emerging trend of increased mobile based storage (NAND) and (SSD) as well as the increasing prevalence of wireless-based cloud storage. Because of these problems, Western Digital has seen its financial prospects drop significantly since December 2014. However, on March 15th, 2016 WDC stockholders approved a merger between Western Digital and SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) for $18 billion with a shareholder approval rating of 90 percent. The terms of the buyout include $9 billion in term loans, $8 billion in bridge loans and $1 billion in credit. Western Digital has strategically bought SanDisk at a share price of $86.50 (with debt and long-term futures value added) in what we believe is a considerable discount to the future potential performance of the WDC/SNDK combined entity. By combining the financial statements of both companies and using conservative analyst expectations to forecast future cash flows of both companies, we have calculated that the combined entity currently trades at around 60% discount to its intrinsic price.Merger with SanDisk to unlock value in Chinese marketsThe major strategic value of the WDC/SNDK acquisition is that SanDisk has major influence in the East Asian market which has traditionally been hard for American storage and memory providers to compete profitably. Even though SanDisk holds only a 12% percent market share within the total flash memory and external hard drive markets, its value and technical ability exceeds that of its East Asian competitors. This acquisition will likely make Western Digital a powerhouse for storage needs that will now be able to meet both the Chinese and North American storage requirements. The main theory behind this acquisition is that Western Digital wants to compete with industrial chip makers such as Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Toshiba to provide cheaper NAND and SSD chips to the market place. Western Digital is likely to shape demand needs within East Asian consumers such as Apple and Samsung with high end mobile NAND storage and to possibly continue growth within emerging markets in South Asia and Southeast Asia, in countries such as Vietnam and India that have a growing mobile market."
Investing With An Edge: Hutchinson Technology,Feb. 1.16,"This is the latest in my ""Investing with an Edge"" series. For more on the series, please see here.Company: Hutchinson Technology (NASDAQ:HTCH). Reasons for opportunity: small size, complex deal, regulatory review.In November, Hutchinson announced a deal to be acquired by TDK (OTCPK:TTDKY). The deal structure is somewhat complex, and the merger received a request for further information from the FTC. The combination of those two factors has led shares to trade at a ~12% discount to the deal's most likely close price. Based on our analysis, we think the market is currently assigning ~20% chance that the deal breaks, but we think the true odds of the deal breaking is ~5% and the merger closes some time during the company's current time frame of late Q1 or early Q2 (so likely ~late April), resulting in an extremely attractive IRR for investors at today's prices.Let's start with an overview of the deal structure and then discuss the FTC risk. HTCH is getting acquired for $3.62 per share plus $0.0108 per share for every $500k of net cash over $17.5m HTCH has as of the last day of the fiscal month immediately preceding the merger close. This additional consideration is capped at $0.38 (or a net cash balance of ~$35m) for a max value of $4/share. Note that the cash is counted net of the company's revolver draw but ignores other debt.The obvious first question is: Will investors be paid this additional consideration? We believe the answer is yes, investors will be paid the full $0.38/share. There are several reasons for this:"

I say, ""Nothing.""GEORGE: There you go.(A moment passes)JERRY: (Nodding) I think you may have something there. - The Jerry Seinfeld Show: ""The Pitch"" by Larry DavidSo here we are, post a highly informative Winter Analysts Meeting, and Micron's (NASDAQ:MU) stock has actually rebounded somewhat based largely on analysts' hopes for MU's 3D NAND product. Some are also crediting the DRAM story with some upside based on two factors; the first factor being a maturing 20nm shrink, bringing a surge of less costly DDR4 bits to the market in FY Q3 onward, and the second being Micron's purchase of Inotera. There is plenty of reason to think that neither is likely to result in a profitable enterprise soon, though the additional $600m a year in positive cash flow from Inotera will certainly help offset the enormous $5B CapEx spend projected for this FY.If 90% of success is just showing up, timing is the other 10%, and Micron's timing could hardly be worse. Unfortunately, the surge of additional DRAM bits will simply add capacity to a market already struggling to find profitable homes for its supply. It's certainly a good thing that Micron's DRAM cost basis will drop 15-25% per year over the next two years, but all that will do is keep its DRAM business from showing negative gross margins in FY 2016. My prediction: 10% gross margins on perhaps 5% greater bit shipments this year translate into a DRAM business returning maybe 5% operating margins."
HIE: Active Management From Lowell Miller For Free,Feb. 1.16,"IntroductionLowell Miller is the founder and chief investment officer of Miller/Howard Investments, a form that he founded in 1984. Miller's investment philosophy focuses on dividend paying companies, and he has written three books on investing, including the well-known ""The Single Best Investment: Creating Wealth with Dividend Growth"".A recent (2014) interview with Miller has been conducted by Seeking Alpha author Jason Van Steenwyk. In that interview, Miller clearly states his logic for focusing on dividend-paying companies:It's only logical that, over time, an increase in cash flows to investors will result in a commensurate increase in the value of the equity producing the dividend, all other things being equal. It's similar to income real estate; the property is valued in large part based on its cash flow. If the rents increase, then the value of the property increases. So the investor benefits from both higher income and from the appreciation that higher income induces.The Miller/Howard shop has, to my knowledge, two exchange-traded products on the market: the Citigroup C-Tracks Miller/Howard Strategic Dividend Reinvestor ETN (NYSEARCA:DIVC) and the Miller/Howard High Income Equity CEF (NYSE:HIE).

The Dow bubble deflated as Dupont replaced IBM in the ten slot of the top ten for July to peg the gap at $269 or 71%, then inflated again as IBM replaced Pfizer to widen the gap to $331 or 85% for August.September brought some sanity back to the runaway Dow when the gap stood at $279 or 67%. October increases in price by CVX and XOM pushed the gap to $334 or 85%. November changed out MCD for WMT, and GE for KO. The resulting price over dividend gap went to $303 or 78%.As of December 8 the gap stood at $292 or 75%. Come January 20, Boeing moved up to the ten so price of the ten Dow top dogs swelled, and dividend shrank, to push the overbought gap back up to $351 or 91.5%. The influx of CSCO and INTC technology pushed consumer goods stalwarts P&G and KO out of the top ten to shrink the gap to $270 or 66% as of February 22.This gap between high share price and low dividend per $1k invested defines the Dow over-bought condition. Meaning these are low risk and low opportunity Dow dog stocks. The Dow top ten average price per dollar of annual dividend was $24.26.Compared to the DOW the NASDAQ ten, tracked a little past a ""normal"" pattern of aggregate dividend value of $1k investments in each exceeding the aggregate single share price. The NASDAQ dogs showed normal could be achieved. (Notice the crossing point in July where dividends moved above price.) The NASDAQ top ten average price per dollar of annual dividend was $23.63 as of February 22.NASDAQ Dogs UpsideResults from IndexArb.com tallied for 46 NASDAQ 100 Index members paying dividends as of market closing prices February 22, 2016 were stacked against analyst mean target price projections one year out. The results led to the actionable conclusions discussed below.Actionable Conclusions: (4) 10 Top NASDAQ 100 Dogs Displayed 30.64% Average Upsides Per Analyst Target Readings To February 2017 (5) A 16.23% Downside Was Also NotedActionable Conclusion (5): Wall St. Wizards Cast A 14.67% Average 1 yr. Upside & (6) A 13.16% Average Net Gain for Top 30 NASDAQ 100 Dogs To February 22, 2017Top 30 dogs on the NASDAQ 100 index stock list graphed below showed relative strengths by dividend and price as of February 22, 2016 and those projected by analyst median price target estimates to the same date in 2017.A hypothetical $1000 investment in each equity was divided by the current share price to find the number of shares purchased. The number of shares was then multiplied by projected annual dividend amounts to find the dividend return. Thereafter the analyst mean target price was used to gauge each stock's upside to 2017.Historic prices and actual dividends paid from $1000 invested in each of the highest yielding stocks and the aggregate single share prices of those thirty stocks divided by 3 created the data points for 2016. Projections based on estimated increases in dividend amounts from $1000 invested in the thirty highest yielding stocks and aggregate one-year analyst target share prices from Yahoo Finance divided by 3 created the 2017 data points on the chart below: green for price and blue for dividend.Yahoo reported Thomson/First Call analyst survey numbers predicted a 12% lower dividend from $10K invested as $1k in the average ten of this group, while aggregate single share price of those ten was predicted to increase 17.3% in the coming year. Notice that the 2016-17 graph shows price above dividend. Apparently analysts believe the Dow overbought condition will return to the NASDAQ 100 in 2016.Actionable Conclusion (7): Analysts Asserted 10 NASDAQ 100 Dividend Dogs Would Net 24.27% to 52.23% By February 2017Five of the top ten dividend yielding NASDAQ 100 dogs were detected among the top ten gainers for the coming year based on analyst 1 year target prices.

Seagate: Does The Hard Disk Have A Future?,Jul.13.16,"Seagate's (NASDAQ:STX) earnings pre-announcement on July 11 got investors excited and sent the stock up over 21% the following day. This was probably a case of investors not looking very closely at the announcement. Seagate announced a 9.5% y/y decline in revenue for the quarter ending July 1, and other key metrics such as gross margin and HDD unit shipments declined as well. Seagate's results only reflect the fortunes of the HDD industry as a whole.Source: InfoWorldDeclining MarketSeagate expects revenue of $2.65 billion for its fiscal 2016 Q4 and gross margin of 25%. This beat guidance, and apparently the expectations of many investors, but it still reflected a decline from the year-ago quarter. In fiscal 2015 Q4 revenue was $2.927 billion and gross margin was 26.5%.Seagate also announced an additional 6500 job cuts on top of the 1600 announced a few weeks ago.Seagate has invested in solid state drives, buying Sandforce from Avago shortly after its purchase of LSI in 2014. Seagate now offers a credible line of enterprise class solid state storage devices, including Nytro branded devices that came with the Sandforce purchase.Nevertheless, Seagate is still heavily dependent on HDDs. The company reported HDD unit shipments for the quarter of 37 million with an average selling price of $67. That works out to revenue from hard drives of $2.479 billion or 93.5% of total revenue for the quarter.This represented a 19% y/y decline in unit shipments, although ASP was up 6% from last year."
"No, Seagate's Dividend Is Not Safe",Sep.12.16,"Seagate Technology, ticker (NASDAQ:STX), has gotten a fair amount of coverage lately, particularly in regards to the large current dividend yield, and whether or not these shareholder distributions were sustainable moving forward. Thus far, there seem to be two camps - one that believes the dividend is sustainable, and one that believes the company should cut or suspend the dividend. I decided to take a little deeper look myself at the numbers, and have come to a different conclusion. Seagate will have to cut or suspend the dividend it is currently distributing. But first, let's cover some basics on the company.Seagate designs, produces, and distributes electronic data storage technology and solutions throughout the world. From the most recent 10-K, Seagate markets itself as ""a leading provider of electronic data storage technology and solutions. Our principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs. In addition to HDDs, we produce a broad range of electronic data storage products including solid state hybrid drives (""SSHD""), solid state drives (""SSD""), PCIe cards and SATA controllers. Our storage technology portfolio also includes storage subsystems, and high performance computing (""HPC"") solutions. Our Cloud Systems and Solutions builds on the Seagate legacy to extend innovation from the device into the information infrastructure, onsite and in the cloud.""As alluded to in the summary bullets above, Seagate has struggled to grow or even sustain revenues the past few years, as the company's product mix, which is still heavily (>90%) dependent on HDDs, has left it vulnerable to competing technologies, in particular solid state drives, or SSDs. Although Seagate is actively attempting to diversify its product mix away from HDDs, having already been successful in developing an industry-leading 2 terabyte NVMe enterprise SSD product and continually developing cloud storage solutions, the failure to thus far materially change the product mix as mentioned has resulted in a disappointing top line trend:"
Seagate: The SSD Tipping Point,Nov.15.16,"It's long been known that SSDs (Solid State Drives) would provide a massive challenge to HDDs (Hard Disk Drives). I needn't remind that ultimately SSDs are much faster, more reliable, less power hungry and lighter. The benefits to computing, especially mobile computing, are entirely obvious.For the longest of times, SSDs faced but one problem. They were a lot more expensive. As a result, they were only available in lower storage sizes, and these prices and lower storage sizes showed up as being a significant negative for many increasingly storage-hungry applications, such as video. Video, of course, was (and still is) enjoying a massive explosion in usage (at ever-higher resolutions, too).As time went by, SSDs steadily saw their costs head lower, them being aided by Moore's law when it came to semiconductor manufacturing. Again, this isn't new. What is new, is that I believe the market might now be at a tipping point. Prices and capacities have reached a level where, I believe, suddenly desktop/laptop HDDs are going to see an extreme decline.This decline will be aided not just by the SSDs becoming larger and cheaper, but also because video (and photo storage) has for a large part shifted towards the cloud. Now, this cloud doesn't store content on vapor, it also needs HDDs -- but the cost per bit at the cloud level will be lower than the cost per bit at the consumer level. Plus, of course, having a video in 1000 consumer devices consumes a lot more bits than having the video in 1 central location. Anyway, video started being heavily consumed in streaming form, and photos have gained from such freemium services as Google Photos, reducing the need for local storage."

Non-GAAP operating expenses in the June quarter were $443 million. Capital expenditures of $146 million for the June quarter were higher than our previous forecast due to our decision to accelerate the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. In addition, we are accelerating the expansion of our Korat facility to expedite the plan manufacturing footprint reductions across many sites. For the full fiscal year, our capital expenditures were $587 million, approximately 5% of revenue and below our targeted long-term model range of 6% to 8%."
Will Micron Technology's Slap In The Face From Seagate Technology Catalyze A JV With Tsinghua Unigroup?,Dec.16.16,"SK Hynix is expected to set up a joint company with U.S.-based data storage company Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) as part of its plan to bolster its presence in the NAND SSD market. SK Hynix will hold a 51 percent share and Seagate to hold the remaining 49 percent.Seagate has traditionally chosen the route of buying NAND on the open market, eliminating the need for a fab. This contrasts with main HDD competitor Western Digital (NYSE:WD), which acquired a fab when the company purchased flash memory manufacturer SanDisk in mid-May 2016. The fab goes back to 2014 when Sandisk inked an agreement with NAND manufacturer Toshiba to invest jointly in a new fab in Japan to make 3D NAND devices.Seagate then ramped up its SSD offerings when it signed a broad alliance in mid-February 2015 with Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) for access to its NAND devices. The multi-year agreement enabled Seagate to secure a strategic supply of NAND flash memory as well as collaboration on future products and technologies.However, earlier this year STX introduced a new Nytro XF1230 SATA SSD using SK Hynix for its NAND chip instead of MU. The Nytro XF1230 combines SK Hynix's LAMD controllers and eMLC 2D NAND. Seagate had initially teamed with SK Hynix back in 2013 for its 600 Series SSDs, which are now discontinued. Again, Seagate's policy was to buy NAND chips on the open market. Incidentally, the Nytro PCIe SSDs line was acquired by Seagate from Avago (now Broadcom) (NASDAQ:AVGO) in 2014.Where does that leave Micron Technology?Micron has become a vertically integrated NAND flash fabricator and SSD developer, providing a broad offering of technology features for its SATA, SAS and PCIe SSDs."
Seagate Technology PLC - Low Leverage But Higher Risk: Possible Bond-CDS Hedge,Jun. 3.16,"Key Issues:STX faces big challenges in selling its main hard disk drive (HDD) products: PC sales are declining (56% of unit sales), competition for hi-tech solid state drive (NYSE:SSD) sales is fierce, and prices for lower end HDDs keep falling.STX is responding by focusing more on enterprise and data center clients and expanding SSD sales but hasn't yet shown traction in its competition with dominant competitors Intel, Samsung, and the newly combined Western Digital/SanDisk.LTM revenues dropped 23.4% YoY and by 13.1% sequentially last quarter; Adjusted EBITDA margin compressed from 15.9% at FYE'15 ended 6/30/15 to 11.5% in STX's Q3'16 ended 4/1/16 (see financial summary below).STX cut capex guidance to $535mm for FYE 6/30/16 from the $712mm spent FYE 6/30/15 but this likely hurts its ability to gain a technology edge in SSD vs competitors; one solution would be a JV arrangement: STX bought Samsung's HDD division for $1.4bn in 2011 and it could try to adopt Samsung's NAND technologyBond Technicals:STX remains relatively unleveraged despite 6 quarters of revenue declines: 2.4x total leverage, 1.8x net leverage, and a cash pile of $1.2bn vs $4.1bn of total debtWithin the debt complex, STX 3.75 Sr Nts '18 Baa3/BBB mature before the Company's undrawn $700mm revolver expires in January 2020 but they are priced within a point of par; investor focus centers on the STX 4.75 Sr Nts '23 Baa3/BBB ($1bn outstanding). At a price of 86.375 that's a 7.27% yield (+544 bps over UST 10yr) and a -568 basis (i.e., the 4.75s might be hedgeable with 5yr CDS).Among the Company's bond issues, STX 5.75 Sr Nts '34 trade at the lowest price ($70.75) and highest yield (9.00%) but have too long of a tail risk for a CDS hedge and don't correlate highly enough with the equity for a long bond short stock play.

Will Seagate Cut Its Dividend?,Jul.14.16,"On April 27, I recommended Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) investors open a synthetic strangle on the stock. Two days later, the stock showed a breakaway gap and dropped by nearly 30%. I'm assuming none of my readers actually opened the strangle position because my students would normally send me emails asking me whether to close in such a situation:What we are looking at here is almost an ideal application of a synthetic strangle. When such a position is held open, you almost certainly want to take profit on the puts at a breakaway gap. Statistically, you are highly unlikely to see such a huge drop more than one day in a row, implying that profit taking is the preferred action.If you had done so, you would have realized nearly 200% ROI. Then, with the long side still open, you would be up 11%. Also, you would have gained $63 from the dividend.Again the play follows:The total ROI till now is around 47%. Or, on a profit-to-risk basis, 180%. This is all under three months' time.Now that we are looking at another breakaway gap, the question of whether to stay, whether to hedge, or whether to go should be on your mind. I could offer another options strategy, but it seems like another issue is more pressing at the moment. Some analysts are calling into question the stability of STX's dividend:"
Western Digital: Merger With SanDisk Provides New Hope For An Industry Leader,Jun.20.16,"(Image Source: Company Website)Western Digital Corp. (NYSE:WDC) provides hope as an industry leader in the failing Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Market. The hope does not come from conditions the market, but rather from the company strategy, and their recent merger with SanDisk, whose main streams of revenue come from markets ready to capitalize on the fall of HDD.Hard Disk Drives, or HDD, are metallic drives, made from a magnetic disk that rapidly spins, which allows for the storage and retrieval of information. Hard Disk Drives were created in the early 1950s, and became the standard for secondary storage for most computers in the early 1960s. Hard disk drives have continued to evolve and grow in effectiveness since their inception, and are now found most prominently as internal and external storage devices for most computers and laptops. Hard Disk Drives were favored in these devices primarily because of their storage capacity, as the devices are capable of storing upwards of 1,000 GB of data. The primary creators of Hard Disk Drives are Western Digital Corporation , Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ:STX), who own about 40% of the market share each, and Toshiba (TYO JPY), who own about 20% of the market share."
Micron Technology Is In Play,Jul.25.16,"Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has done a lot of shareholder unfriendly things in the past. But last Friday's filing of a poison pill ""rights offering"" takes the cake. The document bears the date of July 20, 2016. But the time stamp on the SEC's EDGAR server says it wasn't accepted by them until ""2016-07-22 17:16:12."" Why post something on Friday after the market close? Why, to lose it for publication and speculation in the weekend financial press. Predictably, Micron was rallying strongly in the Monday pre-market, and as this is written, the stock is trading at $14.16, up 7.8% on the day.What is a rights offering? There are lots of good ideas around. Here is one. Essentially, shareholders are given the right to purchase additional securities at a bargain rate once any shareholder goes over a set threshold. In classic anti-takeover scenarios, this level is typically at 20% of the outstanding shares. This particular rights offering, with a trigger of 4.9% and with its language on Section 382 of the IRS code, is styled as a rights offering to prevent a change of control that would jeopardize the company's Net Operating Loss Carryforwards.And indeed, the company does have billions of NOLs as the most recent 10-K details on page 84:"
The End Of AMD,Dec.28.16,"""AMD (NYSE:AMD) is not a buying opportunity"" the article reads. We think they have missed the bigger picture - indeed - the end of AMD is at hand. The company we have lived with for the last 5 years is coming to a close as a new chapter opens up. This company's ecosystem and opportunities are set to radically change. How do we play this? Do we simply buy the stock or are there other options for playing this? Let's explore - shall we?AMD is a Long-term BuyMany wonder if AMD will pull back some. We have wondered such as well, since it has had a nice rise. However, when you look at the total potential catalysts, you can begin to understand why AMD has ryzen (bad pun intended) in price.Nine catalysts include:1. A new (arguably competitive) consumer CPU called Ryzen due out this quarter. This will feature AMD entering back into the arena, duking it out vs. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the CPU war (an arena that sadly AMD has been almost absent from over the past few years). Will Ryzen beat Intel? Maybe... Maybe not. In the grand scheme of things, it really does not matter if they do or not. All they really need is a processor that performs well and is competitive. From that vantage point - they can compete on price.2. New server CPUs - due out the 2nd half of 2017. At one point in time, AMD had 26% of the server market and was in Cray (NASDAQ:CRAY) supercomputers, but lost it all. We expect AMD to re-enter this market and (just shooting from the hip) take 10% market share. Vendors do not want Intel to have a monopoly in this market. Vendors want competition in order to get better pricing. AMD stands to take 1.5 billion of revenue in this market if they only take a mere 10% market share. (For a more detailed view, read the most excellent article by author Anchorite here.)3. New APU CPU based on Ryzen in the works. This will reinvigorate AMD in the low-to-medium end for laptops and desktops. For users who want decent graphics and the ability to do some light gaming-on-a-budget - this is a great option."
Proofpoint: Can The Company Provide Proof Of Future Profits?,Oct.11.16,"Elaborated email filtering is really what is done by Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT).

OK - no one really thinks that solving the problems of email is one equivalent to solving the problems of age. That is no one except current investors who are willing to value the shares at levels that seem beyond the prospects of the domain in which this company competes.Of course, after Sunday night's debate, one has to wonder about what is really important. Certainly not the future. Maybe it might be the amount of pure nastiness and insolence that can be compressed into a short time frame. Maybe it is seeing who has the worst locker room stories to share. Political satire is not my thing as I am not politically correct. I would doubtless offend half of the potential readers here or elsewhere if I answered some of those so-called town hall questions and others of the readership community might describe my views as those of a wimp.But this is an article about Proofpoint, the company, and the prospects for its shares. I was just struck that a company whose basic technology is that of an email filter has become such a significant enterprise software player. I really wouldn't have thought that would happen and I never thought something like that debate might happen either.In taking a deeper look at what it means to sell email security solutions in this era, I was struck by some of the features and capabilities that users are seeking. Proofpoint does have a surprising level of product differentiation and perhaps a functioning product moat of some kind. But after considering the subject and reading further, my conclusion is that while the next several quarters are likely to be strong for the company, there are too many shoals and aquatic monsters for the captain to get to his $1 billion sales port. Yes, the shares can be traded to the upside in the short term although not by me at this valuation, but there are other names that have a better combination of risk and rewards."
AbbVie Has Been Moving Under The Radar,Jan. 1.17,"Don't look now but shares of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) have been moving higher ever so slowly. With the patent expiry of famed product Humira having passed, one has to wonder whether or not there really is competition for it since the stock price of the company has not eroded as of yet. The stock does remain some $8 off its all-time highs from about eighteen months ago but with the world's best-selling drug product going off patent now an investor would have presumed a Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) like draw-down in the share price. Nevertheless, it is always important to remain vigilant in doing homework on the stocks one owns in their portfolio to see what else is happening.In my humble opinion I believe that AbbVie has quite a bit going on in the pipeline that can bolster any potential sales losses from Humira. One such product from the pipeline is risankizumab, which the FDA recently declared as an orphan drug treatment for Crohn's disease in pediatrics. The overall market for the specifics of this disease may be small, hence the orphan drug title, but it proves that AbbVie has successful products in the pipeline. For adults, risankizumab is currently in Phase 2 trials and may take another four to six years to come commercial if successful. Investors however must remember that this product was licensed from Boehringer Ingelheim back in March.Humira is not the only blockbuster product that AbbVie has in its portfolio; it also holds the rights to Imbruvica, an oncology product which came over from the Pharmacyclics deal a couple of years ago. Imbruvica is AbbVie's second best selling product but is also being utilized as a pipeline within a product. It currently is undergoing a Phase 2 clinical trial for treating patients with relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma. It is currently being tested as a second line therapy and the patients showed some good results. The ability to try and use an existing product to treat multiple other disease is very powerful and can result in great returns for investors, but most importantly a chance for survival in patients."
Benjamin Graham Would Love These 10 Companies Today,"Jul. 23, 2016 2:28 PM ET","Out of the multitude of companies, which ones would legendary value investor Benjamin Graham buy today? I've compiled ten great companies that fit the ModernGraham criteria, based on Benjamin Graham's methods. The companies in this list pass the rigorous requirements of either the Defensive Investor or the Enterprising Investor and are undervalued by the market.Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)Bank of America Corp is suitable for the Enterprising Investor but not the more conservative Defensive Investor. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the insufficient earnings stability or growth over the last ten years. The Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns. As a result, all Enterprising Investors following the ModernGraham approach should feel comfortable proceeding with the analysis.As for a valuation, the company appears to be Undervalued after growing its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $0.01 in 2012 to an estimated $0.92 for 2016. This level of demonstrated earnings growth outpaces the market's implied estimate of 3.02% annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years. As a result, the ModernGraham valuation model, based on Benjamin Graham's formula, returns an estimate of intrinsic value above the price. (See the full valuation)"
Could Intel Break Up Into 2 Companies?,Jun.13.16,"During an interview with the CEO of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Brian Krzanich, in April, Jim Cramer hinted at the possibility of Intel breaking up into two companies. Upon further research and analysis, Intel's potential corporate spinoff carries both key advantages and synergistic sacrifices.Intel operations are currently divided into client computing, data center and IoT solutions.Client computing is the company's PC microprocessor business consisting of its PC client group and mobile and communications group. This segment accounts for 60% of the firm's revenue. The CCG has reported falling earnings for the last fiscal year and disappointed again in the most recent quarter reporting 1Q16. The falling revenue growth can partially be contributed to the global slowdown in PC sales, falling 6.9% YoY. Intel is actively trying to boost PC sales by partnering with Microsoft Windows, however Windows 10 failed to jump start PC sales. The incredible cash cow that is Intel's CCG department comes from the fact that it dominates the PC processor market with 80% market share.Data center includes Intel's communication and connectivity businesses as well as security software and storage. It has seen upwards of 6% YoY growth with 12% YoY growth in security software solutions. Intel explained in its most recent report that growth in the data center and IoT segments make up for challenges in the PC segment.IoT solutions is a segment consisting of platform and connectivity for enterprises and smart devices. This is the fastest growth segment at 22% YoY and is the primary growth driver of Intel.Intel is beginning to invest heavily in its IoT and data center capabilities, putting itself at a favorable position in comparison to competitors. It maintains its client computing division as a stable source of cash to fuel its new product development efforts in IoT and data storage/security. In this aspect, the company itself is under great hands with Krzanich at the helm. Unlike semiconductor counterparts SanDisk (SNDK) and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), Intel has made major progress toward leading the IoT trend. Although Intel is positioned positively in the semiconductor landscape, its stock price clearly does not reflect its positioning in IoT and data spaces. This brings up the potential of a corporate spinoff."
"Western Digital Corp. - Stock Popped Higher, What About WDC Bonds?","Jun. 3, 2016 8:08 AM ET","Key Issues:WDC acquired SanDisk for $14bn on May 13th. That's a hefty 10.6x SNDK's EBITDA and WDC needs to be selling SNDK's NAND solid state drives (SSDs) as its sales of hard disk drives (HDDs) have been falling. WDC is still the largest HDD maker (43% market share vs Seagate at 42% and Toshiba at 15%);WDC is now the 3rd major competitor in the overall memory storage market (with Intel and Samsung) and a leader in planar NAND technology within the SSD space; competition over new 3-D NAND technology will be fierce among the triopoly but WDC is in a much better position - for example, WDC via SNDK has a JV with Toshiba for SDD which could put further pressure on Seagate if it turns out that 3-D NAND permanently cuts the addressable market for HDDs.With HDD volumes still falling and prices flat at $60 apiece, WDC's revenues dropped from $14.6bn at FYE 7/3/15 to LTM $12.7bn in Q3'16 ended 4/1/16 (and -14.9% sequentially); Adjusted EBITDA margin compressed from 15.8% at FYE 7/3/15 to 11.8% in WDC's Q3'16 ended 4/1/16 (see financial summary below).SNDK's higher growth and higher margins could be seen when, post-deal, WDC announced markedly increased revenue guidance for Q4'16 ended 6/30/16: $3.35-3.45bn vs the pre-deal guidance of $2.5-2.7bn. Management also expects gross margins of 31% in Q4'16 (up from 27% in Q3'16) and $500mm of synergies.Bond Technicals:WDC's credit metrics change dramatically post the SNDK deal: total debt increases from $2.0bn to $20.6bn (including a $1bn undrawn revolver) in Q4'16 ending 7/1/16 - this implies total leverage temporarily spikes up from 0.3x to more than 9.0x; WDC's interest expense increases from $14mm in Q3 to $220mm in Q4'16 (including debt issuance charges)."
"Hutchinson Technologies: With TDK Acquisition Unlikely To Be Approved, The Larger Concern Is Bankruptcy Risk",Aug. 1.16,"On July 26th, the office of TDK and NHK Spring were raided by the Japanese Fair Trade Commission for price collusion in the HDD suspension market which is Hutchinson Technology's primary business. Our sources indicate that Hutchinson Technologies (NASDAQ:HTCH) management was taken completely by surprise by this news, which is understandable. However, it is now highly unlikely that the U.S. Fair Trade Commission will allow this transaction to be approved. At a minimum, any transaction approval will be severely delayed and will likely go beyond November 1st of 2016 which allows TDK to walk away from the acquisition without a break-up fee or any repercussion.So now we must look at Hutchinson on the fundamentals which have deteriorated since the TDK transaction was announced last November. Per statements from both Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NYSE:WDC), Hutchinson's two primary customers (accounting for 85%-90% of sales), the TAM (total addressable market) for HDD suspensions continue to shrink, which is the market that HTCH serves. Further, HTCH has been unable to diversify its revenue away from the suspension market. It appears any new product development or marketing was put on hold so HTCH could try to maintain a cash position that would allow it to maximize the price TDK paid.Now the real concern. HTCH has $76 million of convertible debt due January of 2017. They also have $37.5 million due October of 2019 and $13.5 million of bank debt with PNC bank. Given that HTCH has not been profitable for year and has lost $22 million through the first 9 months of FY 2016, we see very few refinancing options for the company. Any equity raise to pay off this debt would basically have to totally recapitalize the company and would be close to wiping current equity holders out. Given the TDK situation, we don't see how other industry competitors can buy HTCH and given the negative cash flow, a financial buyer is out of the picture."

Capex Cuts At Samsung Could Cause Pushouts In Display Equipment,Sep.21.16,"Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) announced on September 18, 2016, it sold stakes it held in four companies - U.S. chipmaker Rambus and hard drive producer Seagate, Dutch semiconductor firm ASML and Japan's Sharp - in order raise money ""to focus on its core business.""The current problem stems from issues with Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 and a recall of 2.5 million smartphones that could cost the company as much as $1 billion.Capital expenditures (MUTF:CAPEX) for 2015 totaled KRW 14.7 trillion for semiconductors and KRW 4.7 trillion for displays. For 1H 2016, CAPEX totaled KRW 4.1 trillion for the Semiconductor business and KRW 3.4 trillion for the Display Panel business, representing only 39% of spend for full-year 2015.With problems discussed above and my rationale below, I predict that Samsung will double capex for semiconductors to KRW 8.2 trillion for the full year, a drop of 44% compared to 2015. CAPEX for displays will stall, reaching KRW 4.0 trillion for the year but down only 15% compared to 2015. I base this analysis on several factors tied to the company's sales, profits, capacity utilization and sector outlook.Table 1 below shows Samsung Electronics' Segment Sales and Operating Profits from its Q2 2016 Earnings Release.Table 1"
"If You Think Intel Will Double In The Next 5 Years, Sell It Now And Buy Micron",Sep.12.16,"Overview:Recently well-known SA Contributor Electric Phred wrote an article arguing that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has an excellent chance of doubling sales and profits over the next 5 years. EP provides a well thought out and cogent argument and concludes that if indeed that happens the price of Intel would double also to $68.Although I disagree with EP's analysis if he's right then Micron (NASDAQ:MU) is the much better buy. In this article I will explain why Micron's 50/50 Joint Venture (JV) share of 3D NAND and 3D Xpoint production will propel a $16 billion company forward much faster than a $60 billion company.""Double, double toil and trouble;Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.""William ShakespeareSource: IntelHow much sales revenue potential is there in 3D NAND and 3Dx?In EP's analysis he comes up with the following breakdown:From the table we can see that 3D NAND + 3Dx will add up to $20 billion in sales or about 33% of Intel's current year revenue estimate of $60B. But since the Joint Venture (JV) with Micron is 50/50 it is reasonable to assume that Micron will also generate somewhere in the neighborhood of $20 billion revenue too. And since Microns revenue is now about $16 billion the 5 year numbers would be 125% of revenue vs. Intel's 33%. So obviously the JV is much more valuable to Micron than Intel."

AbbVie Is Under Duress With Fierce Competition,Oct.19.16,"AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) has been dropping over the past month as investors are getting concerned with all the competition surrounding its products, specifically the Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) biosimilar to compete against HUMIRA. The stock has dropped to the tune of 5%, but at least there was an ex-dividend date in between there on October 12 th.Amgen however wasn't the only company focusing their efforts on the HUMIRA pie. Shire was also in the running but recently halted its partnership with Momenta in search of a biosimilar. But just because Shire halted the partnership does not mean Momenta will halt its efforts or stop anyone else from coming to replace Shire for developing and commercializing the product. In fact, because of the deal Baxalta (Baxalta was acquired by Shire) signed with Momenta, Shire has to continue funding Momenta for a year on the project. This is by no means an invitation to AbbVie to rest on its laurels, as the competition for HUMIRA is heating up with Samsung being thrown in the mix for European approval of their biosimilar, as with Germany's version of Merck (NYSE:MRK), and Cadila Healthcare in India. HUMIRA is one of the best-selling drug products and everyone wants a bite of the apple as the patent is set to expire.The appeal for competitors to create an alternative to HUMIRA is because HUMIRA is a pipeline within a product, meaning it has multiple indications for which the drug is approved. One of those indications is for psoriasis. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) subsidiary, Janssen, recently released data for a phase 3 trial which showed its product to be superior than HUMIRA in individuals with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This product is anticipated to be a reason for J&J's growth because it anticipates the product to be a blockbuster."
Seagate: All Sizzle But No Steak,Mar. 5.17,"As its latest earnings results have proved, Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) has rectified past execution issues over the last year that should enable it to weather revenue declines in its core PC market. But without a significant pick-up in PCs and lack of a meaningful SSD offering, Seagate will continue to face challenges to its revenue, earnings and cash flow generation. In the longer term, Seagate's financial position remains tied to the fate of HDD and should, thus, continue its decline in line with the HDD TAM.Despite the bearish sentiment around the HDD space (which Seagate predominantly operates in), the company has posted an impressive rebound in operating results in part due to better market trends, but also its own aggressive cost management actions. I'd remain focused on the sustainability of the company's momentum given the historical volatility in its performance. Longer term secular challenges facing HDDs and execution risk remain, but thus far, Seagate looks to be making the best of things. Seagate could also ramp up shareholder returns over the coming quarters if cash flow remains solid (barring further strategic M&A).Valuations, however, are not attractive. Investors are currently willing to pay 9-11x PE for declining EPS as earnings may be relatively stable post 2017 for Seagate. But the confluence of weak end market demand and Seagate's high sensitivity to small changes in demand for high-capacity enterprise HDDs will pose downside risks to such valuations.Strong EarningsSeagate reported very strong 2Q results, beating consensus on both revenue and margins for the reported quarter as well as guidance. Will the strong earnings report silence the HDD bears though? Unlikely in my view. But in the meantime, they'll have plenty of food for thought."
Seagate: Buy On The Drop?,Apr.26.17,"This article is the 53rd installment in a segment called ""Buy on the Drop?,"" in which I choose a stock that recently experienced a large decrease in price and give a recommendation on whether investors should ""buy on the drop"" or not. The recommendations are Sell, Hold, Speculative Buy, Buy, and Strong Buy.Seagate Gets BrickedSeagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is down more than 16% in Wednesday trading after reporting third-quarter earnings before the market open, leaving investors wondering whether this is an opportunity to buy. Despite the fall, STX is still up 58% over the last 12 months and about 130% off 52-week lows:STX data by YChartsImproving market conditions have allowed Seagate to make a convincing recovery from sharply declining earnings and collapsing share price to prove the bears wrong. I myself was, and still am to an extent, one of those bears. I wrote two article last year saying that STX was a dividend yield trap and that they needed to cut the dividend, yet here we are in 2017 and the stock is outperforming. I still think the dividend should be cut, but we'll get to that in a bit.Let's first summarize the Q3 report to try and isolate the cause for this steep price decline. Revenue for the quarter $2.67 billion, which missed consensus estimates by $40 million and represents a 3% year-over-year (""YoY"") increase, and EPS was $1.10, which beat estimates by 3 cents and was an impressive $0.88 improvement over Q3 2016 EPS. Seagate also generated $426 million in operating cash flow, paid $186 million in dividends, and raised another $1.25 billion in debt."
Seagate Technology: An Income Darling At A Cheap Price,Apr.30.17,"A year-long surge in price for Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) came to a dramatic end over the past week, with a miss on revenues leading to a precipitous 16% decline in a single day. It should come as no surprise, as any stock that's gone so consistently upward was bound to be extremely sensitive to even relatively minor negative news.STX Price data by YChartsThat's a prototypical overreaction to what in the grand scheme of things is relatively minor news. Today, we will examine the underlying prospects of Seagate after this event and see whether this is a genuine buying opportunity.StabilityPC sales have been on the decline in recent years, and with Seagate's business heavily dependent on sales to original equipment manufacturers, it's been a drag on revenue. There are some early signs that sales may be starting to recover, which is a reason for some hope.This revenue decline has been by no means a constant drop-off. Rather, the latest PC market weakness took a bite out of revenue, and has been flat since, with analysts projecting revenues staying roughly flat. Seagate CEO Steve Luczo's own assessment of Seagate as operating in a ""stable"" environment was scorned a bit in the financial media, given the stock's selloff, but the analysts' numbers present his assessment as a fair one."
Joel Greenblatt Dividend Stocks In Focus: Seagate Technology,Apr. 4.17,"This post was written by Bob Ciura for Sure DividendSeagate (NASDAQ:STX) is a rarity in the technology sector. Based on its recent share price, the stock offers a 5.5% dividend yield. Such a high dividend yield is usually reserved for utility stocks.Seagate has a volatile dividend history. It is not on the list of Dividend Achievers, a group of 271 stocks with 10+ years of consecutive dividend increases. You can see the full Dividend Achievers List here. But, its high yield has attracted the attention of Joel Greenblatt, Managing Principal and Co-Chief Investment Officer of Gotham Asset Management. Seagate is one of the top 20 dividend stocks in Joel Greenblatt's portfolio.Gotham owns approximately 546,000 shares of Seagate, an investment worth roughly $21 million.Seagate has a very high dividend yield, which is normally a 'red flag' that the company is in trouble.While Seagate is in a turnaround phase, it continues to generate enough cash flow to maintain its hefty dividend payout.This article will analyze Seagate and its dividend.Business OverviewSeagate provides data storage products, mainly hard disk drives, which account for 90% of the company's revenue by product line.Seagate had a difficult year in 2016. Revenue declined 19% for the year. The decline in revenue was due to three factors, which were the strong U.S. dollar, weaker economic conditions in China, and the troubles facing the personal computer segment.Seagate has a large international footprint, with the majority of its revenue coming from outside the U.S. Its revenue breakdown by geography is below:Americas (29% of annual revenue)Europe, Middle East, and Africa (17% of annual revenue)Asia-Pacific (54% of annual revenue)More than half Seagate's annual revenue comes from Asia, meaning the slowdown in the Chinese economy last year hit the company particularly hard. And, the steady decline in global PC shipments has caused related storage devices to decline in tandem.The smartphone boom has shown no signs of slowing down. As more computing functions are performed on smartphones, there is less demand for laptop and desktop computers. Technology industry research firm Gartner found that 2016 marked the 5th consecutive year that global PC shipments fell. For the year 2016, PC shipments declined 6.2% from 2015. PC client shipments continue to represent 24% of Seagate's HDD revenue. That said, the company still generated more than $11 billion of revenue last year."

The drivers of our improving performance, particularly in the December quarter are combination of market demand trends across our high capacity storage solution portfolio, component cost optimization within our storage products, and the structural cost improvements we are driving throughout our company, particularly within our manufacturing operations."
"Seagate -16% after earnings, conservative guidance","Apr. 26, 2017 2:38 PM ET","Seagate (STX -16.2%) shares have tanked today and are still drifting lower in the afternoon, in the wake of a revenue miss in today's fiscal Q3 earnings that also featured downside guidance.Shares had hit a 52-week high yesterday.Gross margin was 30.5% (31.4% on a non-GAAP basis), and the company is projecting 31% for the current quarter.Results reflect a ""stable demand environment, good operational execution and momentum in the stabilization of our business model,” says Chairman/CEO Steve Luczo, but notes ""cautious optimism"" looking ahead.He's forecasting revenues of $2.5B-$2.6B (vs. $2.56B consensus), pointing to seasonal declines, a wish to hold smaller inventory going into summer, and ""some conservatism due to the potential impact of component shortages in DRAM and NAND on various aspects of our customers' businesses in the server, CSP and client space.""Overall exabyte demand should grow double digits in calendar 2017, representing ""modest"" revenue growth opportunities.

We've posted our press release and detailed supplemental information for our March quarter of fiscal 2017 on our Investor Relations site at Seagate.com.For the last few years, we have communicated our belief that data growths trends will continue to drive storage exabyte demand and the related measurement of capacity per drive and that units are less relevant to mobile cloud environments and future client addressable markets.In today's newly deployed architectures and applications, high-capacity mass storage is critical. Importantly for Seagate, it is the advanced technology and heads of media, as well as manufacturing absorption of these technologies and test capacity absorption that will most significantly impact our financial performance.Going forward, we will continue orienting our conference call remarks and supplemental data to key market exabyte results and other business metrics and discontinue providing unit detail.

My Proposed 14% Income Yield Trade With Seagate,Jan.10.17,"I am worried about the over-valuation of the market. I am concerned about the potential compression of dividend stocks as interest rates climb. At the same time, I cannot recommend sitting on the sidelines since the market could keep grinding upwards for years to come - albeit at a slower pace.So what is an investor supposed to do when the market is offering a large plate of blah?My recommended play for 2017 is to either sell cash-secured put options or deep in-the-money covered call options. These have the same basic effect on your account. First, I will talk about the basic process of this trade and then I will focus on performing this trade with Seagate (NASDAQ:STX).Covered Calls vs. In-The-Money Put SellingA covered call is where you own the underlying (shares) but sell rights on them.For example, you own shares at $100 apiece and you sell the rights with a strike price at $75 per share. You collect a premium for selling this contract. You do not participate in any upside gain but you also do not incur any losses until prices hit $75 per share. Your return is based on dividends (yes, you still collect the full dividend on the stock) plus the options premium.Selling a cash-secured put means you put cash in your account and make an agreement to buy shares should they fall to a certain price.Assume the stock is at $100 per share and you are willing to purchase shares at $75 apiece. You collect a premium for this contract. You do not participate in any upside move of the stock - because you don't own it. You do not collect dividends. You are obligated to own shares at $75 apiece if the contract is exercised, so you incur losses below this level. The options premium will typically include value of the dividend - although you don't actually receive one."
Seagate Technology: High Yield Dividend Income Or Value Trap?,Apr.19.17,"Many of the most popular high yield stocks are real estate investment trusts (REITs), master limited partnership (MLPs), and business development companies (BDCs). All of these industries are designed to pay very high dividends.When it comes to regular corporations, however, a very high dividend yield can be a warning sign that something is fundamentally flawed with the company's business model.Many of these companies tend to have relatively low Dividend Safety Scores, indicating that their dividends could be at risk of being cut in the future.Let's take a closer look at Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), which offers a high dividend yield above 5% and has paid higher dividends for six straight years, to see if the stock could be appropriate for our Conservative Retirees dividend portfolio.Business OverviewFounded in 1978 in Dublin, Ireland, Seagate Technology is one of the world's largest suppliers of data storage hardware, including hard drives, solid-state hybrid drives, solid-state flash-based drives, and memory cards.The company's products are found in everything, from PCs, mobile phones, tablets, and digital video recorders (DVRs) to cloud computing servers.However, Seagate's fortunes continued to be tied to its specialty, hard disk drives (HDDs), which is the industry it helped pioneer. HDDs are devices that store digital information on rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. They have been used in a number electronic devices, such as PCs, for decades.Business AnalysisUp until recently, Seagate was flying high on the boom in demand for data storage devices.While that demand continues to grow rampantly, the company is facing major challenges in growing its top and bottom line on two fronts."
"Seagate Tries Less Production, More Tech Sharing In China Retrench",Jan.12.17,"New reports are saying that hard disk drive maker Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) is closing down a factory in the eastern city of Suzhou as part of a restructuring plan to revive its operations. Such a development isn't huge news, since the global semiconductor sector is undergoing a major consolidation.But this particular closure also comes just months after Seagate announced a new tie-up with Chinese partner Sugon to tap the local market for IT products and services. So the bigger question becomes: What's the meaning of this factory closure and the newer joint venture, and what's the outlook for semiconductor and high-tech equipment manufacturing in China?The answer seems to be that China is losing its attractiveness as a manufacturing ground for high-tech products partly due to a massive campaign by Beijing to build up a globally competitive domestic chip sector. At the same time, selling IT products services into China is still a lucrative area for foreign makers of chips and networking equipment. But they can only do that now in partnership with Chinese firms, following Beijing's recent roll-out of a tough new national security law.We'll look more closely at the bigger picture shortly and what it might mean for big foreign tech names in China, but first let's review the basic facts surrounding Seagate. The company is saying it will cut 2,000 jobs as a result of closing its Suzhou factory, which is part of a previously announced broader global restructuring plan (English article)."

What We Learned About Micron Technology From Main Competitor Samsung Electronics,Jan.15.17,"Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) announced its Q1 2017 earnings on December 21, 2016, reporting that revenues increased 23% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. This growth was attributed primarily to 18% and 26% increases in DRAM and trade NAND sales volumes, respectively, and a 5% increase in DRAM average selling prices.While that sounds good, it's difficult to compare results without a reference, particularly since MU's fiscal quarter ended on December 1, 2016 and those of main competitors Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix end on December 31, 2016 and have yet to report at the time of this writing.Fortunately, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) gave us a preview of its Q4 2016 earnings report, and we can use it as a metric to determine MU's competitiveness in these extraordinary times when it seems like stock prices are running parallel to memory ASPs.Samsung's semiconductor revenues are expected to increase 19% in Q4, due primarily to a 13% and 28% increase in DRAM and NAND sales volumes, respectively, and an 8% increase in DRAM average selling prices.The table below presents a comparison of the two companiesComparison of Micron Technology and Samsung Electronics - Percentage ChangesMicron TechnologySamsung ElectronicsDRAM Sales (revenue)24%12.6%Gb Sold18%1.9%ASP (per Gb)5%ASP ($)7.7%NAND Sales (revenue)26%28.0%Gb Sold26%15.5%ASP (per Gb)0%ASP ($)8.0%"
Western Digital's Future Business Depends On Toshiba's NAND Spin-Off Decision,Jan.23.17,"Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY) disclosed that it will likely sell a roughly 20% interest in its semiconductor unit for between 200 billion yen and 300 billion yen ($1.77-2.65 billion), while retaining a majority stake and keeping the new company in group earnings. Its semiconductor unit is largely NAND flash memory production.One possible idea being floated as part of the spin-off plan is a partial sale to Western Digital Corp. (NYSE:WDC).As a backdrop to this article, Toshiba and Western Digital operate key flash memory plants together in the Mie Prefecture city of Yokkaichi. Memory chips accounted for the majority of the 1.57 trillion yen in sales of Toshiba's semiconductor operations in fiscal 2015.Toshiba invented both NOR and NAND memory, and first established the flash memory market in 1984. SanDisk had been a long-term partner of Toshiba since 2001, and the joint venture had provided SanDisk with stable NAND supply. The two companies collaborated in developing BiCS3, which they claim was ""the world's first 3D NAND technology with 64 layers,"" up from 48 layers in the previous BiCS2 tech. The technology is now in production, with commercial volumes of BiCS3 expected to become available by mid-2017.Western Digital in 2016 acquired SanDisk for $19 billion, assuming all contractual agreements between Toshiba and SanDisk.Table 1Demand (Million Gb)20152016% Change2017% ChangeMobile23,82530,58528.4%38,38625.5%SSD33,49762,47686.5%113,59181.8%USB/flash21,77028,89232.7%33,76716.9%Other9,88411,68018.2%14,69725.8%Total88,976133,63350.2%200,44150.0%Supply (Million Gb)20152016% Change2017% ChangeSK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF)10,71016,00149.4%22,70041.9%Samsung (OTC:SSNLF)31,84453,99069.5%82,48052.8%Toshiba40,47047,43517.2%63,16033.2%Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)/Micron (NASDAQ:MU)5,87820,119242.3%28,24840.4%Other7466-10.8%9543.9%Total88,976137,61154.7%196,68342.9%"
Western Digital Is A Way To Benefit From Data Storage Demand Growth,Feb.27.17,"Company DescriptionWestern Digital (NYSE:WDC) is a digital storage company with a product suite that includes hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), NAND flash memory, hybrid storage products and systems, and storage-enabling software. In its current form, WDC is the amalgamation of three major companies that have combined over time - the legacy Western Digital business (HDDs), Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, or HGST (HDDs, acquired in 2012), and SanDisk (SSDs and NAND flash, acquired in 2016). WDC is the only digital storage company with fully integrated HDD, SSD, and NAND flash capabilities. The HDD industry is a near-duopoly. WDC and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) each have +/- ~45% market share, with Toshiba (TSSBY) accounting for the remainder. In NAND, WDC/SanDisk controls ~40% of wafer capacity.Variant PerceptionWDC's margins will continue to expand over the next several years, faster than the market is projecting, as the company extracts synergies from HGST and SanDisk and storage supply (HDDs and NAND flash memory) remains constrained relative to demand growth. The market's skepticism over WDC's top line growth model of 4-8%/year will prove unwarranted, with data center data demand growing ~40% year and strong end market opportunities across its product suite. This will result in valuation re-rating on top of earnings growth."
"Western Digital: Not A Bargain Right Now, But A Sound Investment",May. 1.17,"A few days ago Mark Bern published a very informative article about Western Digital Corporation (NYSE: WDC) and raised the question if the company is “an investment or a speculation?” As result of different concerns regarding WDC the author ended the article with the conclusion that the stock is rather speculative. Although I won’t recommend buying Western Digital at current price levels, I'm pretty pleased with my investment so far and will explain why I'm rather bullish than bearish on the stock although there might be some issues with the company. We will look at the future potential of data storage, we will look at the development of revenue and net income and end the article with an intrinsic value calculation. But we will start the discussion by looking at the most worrisome aspect – the high debt levels.The debt: Rather concerningFor many years Western Digital had almost no debt (and hence a very low D/E), but on May 12, 2016, the acquisition of SanDisk was officially completed and in order to finance the transaction WDC took on several billions in debt. On December 30, 2016, the total debt was $13,299 million. Six months earlier the total debt was about $17.5 billion and therefore WDC already managed to reduce the outstanding debt by $4.2 billion (but had to reduce the cash and cash equivalents from $8,151 million to $4,940 million). Most of the outstanding debt needs to be paid back in the years between 2020 and 2024. The D/E ratio of 1.24 can give us a first hint - that the debt levels are not extreme, but can be a burden for the company."
Best And Worst Performing Stocks Since The Inauguration,"Feb. 22, 2017 2:50 AM ET","It has now been one full month since Donald J. Trump was inaugurated as President, and you may recall that the general consensus after the big post-election rally was that investors should ""buy the Election and sell the Inauguration."" Even though the 'buy' part of the strategy was never mentioned until early January - well after the market rallied in November - the consensus trade was that all of the gains pre-Inauguration were being borrowed from the future and that investors would sell the news after Trump was sworn in. It has only been a month, but so far the strategy hasn't quite panned out. Since Inauguration Day, the S&P 500 is up 3.3%, while the average performance of the 500 stocks in the index is even better at +3.6%.In the tables below, we provide a brief summary of the S&P 500's biggest winners and losers during the first full month under President Trump. The first table below lists the 25 biggest winners over the last month. Leading the way higher is Arconic (NYSE:ARNC), which thanks to an activist investor, is up over 40%. Behind ARNC, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is the only other stock up more than 20%. Other notable names on the list include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). In terms of sector representation, it was surprising to see relatively few stocks from the Financials (3) and Industrials (4) sectors as they have been considered to be among the biggest winners under a President Trump. On the flipside, the sectors with the greatest representation are Technology and Health Care, each with six stocks. Both of these sectors did poorly on a relative basis to close out 2016, but investors have started coming around to them regardless of the President's not-so-positive relationship with the sectors."
Western Digital: What's Not To Like?,May. 1.17,"Western Digital (NYSE:WDC), given up for perennial decline through the advent of flash memory and forced into supposed 'shotgun' acquisitions of the likes of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies and SanDisk, the companies fortunes have actually perked up considerably. Management is doing a fine job.The company also has a joint venture with Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF). As the latter is seeking to sell its memory business, we have to wait and see what happens to that, but the company was rather reassuring on this front on the Q3CC (emphasis ours):First, to protect and preserve the health of the JV, which we believe is one of the most successful in the technology industry, and in which we have invested more than $13 billion over its 17-year duration. Second, to protect our interest with respect to any transaction involving the JV interest or assets, none of which could be completed without our consent. And finally, to explore potential long-term value creation opportunities for both Western Digital's and Toshiba's stakeholders.Q3 ResultsThese were rather good - both revenues and earnings beat expectations. Some highlights:Revenue of $4.60B ($20M above expectations).Non-GAAP EPS of $2.39, a beat of $0.25. GAAP EPS is much lower at $0.83 per share (see below for an explanation).Operating cash flow was $1B, whilst free cash flow amounted to $741M - a substantial free cash flow yield of 16%.Non-GAAP gross margin was 39.3%, up 260 basis points sequentially and 650 basis points for the year.The difference between non-GAAP and GAAP metrics is large and includes intangible amortization, charges associated with the acquisitions, and stock-based compensation. The $1B in operational cash flow should put the most impressionable minds at ease at least a little."
"AMD: Do Not Pass Go, Do Not Collect $200",May. 3.17,"Risk ManagementAfter AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) imploded yesterday, I have received a couple of emails asking what to do next. I have been in the investing game over 25 years and I have been guilty in the past of concentrating too much of my portfolio in one stock or one area. I paid a very heavy price.Story TimeOver 10 years ago, I was having lunch with a Wall Street-type in Oregon. He was showing me his style of momentum trading, which I respected (but never embraced). Too much chasing random things for my taste, though I did respect what he did. Showing him my portfolio, he made the comment that I was far too heavy in Nvidia.Quote:""You might get lucky once or ten times doing what you are doing, but that eleventh time will wipe you out.""Those words rang as very true - yet - being told to be cautious (or as in the reader's case, reading it) is far different from experiencing mind-crushing losses. Many years later, I gained first-hand experience with a worst case situation brought on by being too heavy in one stock:OCZ Technology (or...How I learned to Diversify)Rewind back a few years to 2012. Stop there. OCZ was making solid state hard drives and revenues were exploding. Life was good. I had bought in around $3 and up and the stock was around $10. Rumors were out that Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) was going to buy the company. We found out the Seagate plane tail numbers from some SEC statements and we started watching the planes take off and land by OCZs' headquarters by using a website that tracked planes! Yes - they were talking! A buyout was in the works. (Years later, I confirmed talks did occur.)DisasterEarnings day and we were sure OCZ was going to announce a buyout. Well.. not so much. OCZ came out and announced the SEC was investigating them for ""cooking the books"" to the tune of hundreds of millions. The CFO received the customary slap on the wrist and no jail time. The CEO fled to South America (or at least that is the rumor). The SEC investigation is STILL ongoing. Being the after hours market was closed, we were unable to sell or hedge."
Western Digital: Major Savings From Toshiba Acquisition,Apr. 7.17,"""The best deal you make is the one you don't take"" - Donald TrumpWhile that may certainly apply for Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) with the latest newsflow out of Yokkaichi, it definitely isn't the case for Western Digital (NYSE:WDC). The incoming bids have been underwhelming considering Toshiba President Satoshi Tsunakawa's 2T yen asking price with some bids below ¥1.5T.As things stand, signs are pointing to a higher probability of a WDC bid winning out although no signs yet of joint financial backing (e.g. through PE funding).Within the tech community, Toshiba's memory sale is huge - with $18 billion in sales, Toshiba is the world's second-largest memory chip manufacturer by market share behind only Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF).The bids so farFrom Toshiba's perspective, the bid values have been underwhelming. While the latest bid from Silver Lake/Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) was at the higher end of the valuation range, valuations fell far short of Toshiba's asking price. The Nikkei Asian Review noted some bids even came below 1.5 trillion yen (~$13.5B), mainly from private equity.Thus far, bids submitted include - 1) SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) with a Japanese financial institutions for 10 trillion won (~$9B) for 50% of Toshiba memory, implying ~$18B valuation; 2) Silver Lake/Broadcom bid with a ~$18B valuation; and 3) higher-end bids of >2 trillion yen (~$18B) according to Toshiba President Satoshi Tsunakawa.The Silver Lake/Broadcom offerBoth parties recently tendered a ~2 trillion yen ($17.9 trillion) bid. Relative to the other bidders, that would put it on the high end of estimates of the memory business' value.For some perspective, Silver Lake was the lead VC firm that took Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), WDC's main competitor, private in a March 2000 take-out deal for $19 billion. Considering the relationship Silver Lake has with Seagate, a Silver Lake acquisition does not bode well for WDC. Why? It could allow a back door entry of Seagate into the direct manufacture of NAND flash chips or access to cheaper flash chips."
AbbVie: A Brief Overview,Mar.26.17,"Shares of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) have been on a tear during the past month as they are up 5.7% in that time, but have stalled around the $66 mark for the past two weeks. Perhaps the last two weeks coincide with a consolidation phase in the stock because it has moved up so quickly in a short amount of time. Nevertheless this is a value stock, dividend growth stock, and earnings growth stock all wrapped up into one company and the fine folks at Goldman Sachs agree with me.Goldman recently added the stock to their conviction buy list and tacked on a price target of $80. The stock jumped higher on the announcement on March 10th, as can be seen on the chart below but has plateaued ever since. The $80 price target implies a move higher of 21.9%. The upgrade was predicated on the anticipation that AbbVie will have $60B in cash flow in the coming five years. But in the analysis the analyst also refers to a splitting up of the Humira franchise to unlock some value in the stock. This is a very bold statement as Humira is the free cash flow driver for the company right now.Source: Google FinanceShares of the company are currently overvalued on a discounted cash flow analysis according to Simplywall.st. However, the site is expecting earnings to grow 75% over the next three years. When you take a look at the comprehensive review of the stock the earnings growth estimates are off the charts for AbbVie. AbbVie's earnings growth has increased 15.9% over the past year while shares have increased 16.9%."
The Highest Yielding Stocks On The S&P 500 You Should Buy,"May 17, 2017 3:13 PM ET","With interest rates still low, investors continue to search for yield wherever they can find it. I look for stocks that have a nice yield today but are also in a position to continue increasing future dividend payments. In general, I look for the following key attributes:A low payout ratio, which means a company has capacity to sustain and increase dividend payments. Unsustainable payout ratios often result in dividend cuts, which normally are perceived negatively by the market.Projected earnings growth, which should help drive payout ratios down and help sustain increasing dividend payments.A healthy balance sheet. If payout ratios are too high, I look to see how a company has been making payments, which is usually from cash reserves or increasing debt. I especially hate it when a company increases debt to finance dividend payments.Today, I analyzed the S&P 500's top 10 dividend yielding stocks.CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) - 8.60%Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) - 6.73%Macy's (NYSE:M) - 6.40%Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) - 6.27%Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) - 5.85%Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM) - 5.50%Ford (NYSE:F) - 5.49%Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) - 5.19%AT&T (NYSE:T) - 5.10%Kohl's Corporation (NYSE:KSS) - 5.08%Based on my analysis in the table below, I recommend buying CenturyLink, AT&T, and Kimco Realty (in no specific order). Each of these stocks produces enough free cash flow to sustain their dividend payments going forward. I also consider each of these stocks attractively valued, having a clean balance sheet, and reasonable growth prospects."
AbbVie Seems Content With A Small Share Of The Parkinson's Market,Mar. 2.17,"Shares of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) have struggled to keep pace with the rest of the market since the day after President Trump was elected as president. Shares have only moved higher to the tune of 6.8% while the rest of the market as measured by the S&P 500 has moved higher to the tune of 12%. The company's flagship product Humira is under constant attack from competitor and substitution products which contributes to the sluggishness of the share price movement. Now the company's Parkinson's disease product is under attack and I'd like to take the time to evaluate the consequences.Recently NeuroDerm (NASDAQ:NDRM) received excellent results for its Parkinson's Phase 2 trial for ND0612H. When compared to AbbVie's Duodopa the results showed that it had comparable efficacy but with improved use and safety profiles. On the results Cowen increased its price target on NeuroDerm to $70. Just to give you an idea, in the most recent quarter AbbVie made $78M off of Duodopa, or roughly 1.1% of overall revenues.Parkinson's is a central nervous system disorder which causes tremors in the individual affected. Currently more than 200k people in the US are diagnosed with Parkinson's each year and the disease can't be cured. The majority of people affected by the disease are typically in their 40's or older. Duodopa along with other products are used to help treat the symptoms of Parkinson's.The damage in the brain causes a chemical imbalance which Duodopa tries to correct. The product comes as gel but is administered via a portable pump. This is a very laborious task which requires a medical professional to tune the pump to the proper dosage required and involves lots of training on how to use the pump. As you can see it probably won't take much by way of innovation to take revenue away from AbbVie in this arena."
Micron Technology Should Exceed Its Bullish Q3 Forecast,Apr.28.17,"Predicting Micron Technology's (NASDAQ:MU) quarterly earnings with a month remaining in the quarter is a fool's errand. EP is a fool, and this is his errand.A lot has happened since the 2Q earnings release on March 23. One of the best things is the appointment of Sanjay Mehrotra, the former CEO and co-founder of Sandisk as the company's new CEO. The mystery of who would replace Mark Durcan (current CEO retiring at the May board meeting), and when his replacement would be announced, was a significant dark cloud. Mehrotra was a model of clarity at Sandisk (despite his sometimes very thick accent!). He'd spend all day in analyst presentations with audio (and video!) that worked, enough seats for all would be attendees, piles and piles and piles of excellent slides, and excellent presenters from several layers of management. Then there was his wonderful, incomparable CFO, Judy Bruner, who would explain complex financials that would make you slap your forehead with the simplicity of some difficult concepts she conveyed with a minimum of pain. May Mehrotra bring that much better interface to the investment community! May we have well organized and presented and detailed analyst days such as Sandisk used to have. Ernie (current CFO) is far better than Ron (blessedly replaced CFO). But could there be a Judy in our future? Under his leadership, the Mehrotra-led Sandisk sported a multiple, using almost any conceivable metric, well in excess of peers. Mehrotra's Sandisk doubled from a level where I already thought it was fairly priced and was sold to Western Digital (NYSE:WDC) for a nice premium to that higher price. And we Micron shareholders won't talk about what's happened to WDC since this takeover."

Vicor Has 48 Volt Solutions To Electrify Your Portfolio,Feb.13.17,"I remember driving with my father when I was a young boy and seeing power lines. My father would explain to me that the cables carried very high voltage because it was the most efficient way to transport electricity and to minimize voltage drops. 50 years later, this simple lesson helped me understand why Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has utilized this concept by using Vicor's (NASDAQ:VICR) technology to save millions of kilowatt hours in their data centers.The Open Compute Project:Vicor has pioneered the trend toward quadrupling the voltage in data centers in order to provide a more efficient power train for servers. Google has been using the Vicor technology for over 5 years in their data centers and they are encouraging others to follow their lead by joining the Open Compute Project, OCP. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) started the OCP in order to promote energy efficiencies in data centers, and they publish designs that enable the most efficient hardware for others to follow. Google is actively working with Facebook on a 48Volt OCP rack design and the final plan will be published shortly.Companies involved in the OCP include Facebook, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Alphabet, Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), Dell (NYSE:DVMT), Rackspace, Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Juniper (NYSE:JNPR), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Fidelity, Lenovo, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and others.The science behind higher voltage:Alphabet claims that switching to 48V resulted in a 30% improvement in energy efficiency. The science behind this phenomenon is represented by Ohm's law.Ohm's law is pretty simple. It is: I (Current or Amps) = V/R (V = Volts, R = Resistance) and it basically states that if you double the voltage you can double the current with the same amount of resistance. Here is a link to an Ohm's calculator."
"Thailand - Low Growth, High Risk",Feb. 6.17,"I have mixed feelings about the iShares MSCI Thailand Capped ETF (NYSEARCA:THD), On one hand, it appears the share price is ready for a breakout, but on the other hand, there are way too many negatives to propose investing in this country ETF. Let's start with technical analysis.Figure 1 - THD share price time series,2009-presentGlancing at the price chart above, it seems that THD is on the verge of a breakout from the descending channel, and the long-term resistance level.Figure 2 - THD share price time series,2015-presentA closer look shows that the share price will likely continue the upward trend started in Jan 2016. I interpret this as bullish. But before coming to any conclusions on this investment, let's have a look at Thailand's economic and political situation."
AbbVie Is Just A Hold Right Now,Feb.27.17,"Having opened my position in AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) in early June of 2016 and given the fact that it is trading near its 52-week midpoint I believe it is a great time to investigate what is going on with this stock. The stock is off to an underwhelming year moving up 2.5%. Revenues of blockbuster Humira will soon erode with Pfizer's Phase 3 study for their Humira biosimilar showing that it met the primary endpoint for patients with moderate to severe RA. I own the stock in my Portfolio of 12 and the stock hasn't performed to my expectations yet. I feel it is important to examine the specific valuation, financial, and technical situations of AbbVie to see what is really going on with the stock right now.FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 17.01, which is fairly priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 9.65 is currently inexpensively priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. Next year's estimated earnings are $6.44 per share and I'd consider the stock inexpensive until about $97. The 1-year PEG ratio (0.99), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is inexpensively priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 17.21%. The company has great near-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 17.21%. In addition, the company has great long-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 14.38%."
Seagate: A Safe 7% Yield; Hard Drive Business Is Stabilizing,Oct.24.17,"Investors had feared the worst for Seagate (NASDAQ: STX) and the fate of its core business - selling hard drives and disk-based memory, primarily for enterprise servers. With the rise of solid-state drives (SSDs), which offer much faster performance, industry speculators had feared that the HDD market has been rendered obsolete. Such fears have driven down Seagate’s stock from the highs of nearly $50 this year and made its dividend yield extremely juicy (around 7% at the time of writing), and the stock hadn’t made a spectacular comeback until its Q1 print for the quarter ended September.As I covered in a previous article, Seagate's primary competition in SSD drives - built on extremely supply-constrained, expensive NAND flash technology - is often prohibitively expensive, and enterprises still have need for cheap storage solutions for their noncore data assets that don’t need speedy processing. Thematically this makes sense - these days, many companies consider data to be their most valuable asset, and they strive to collect as much of it as possible. Not all of this data is going to be used routinely in intensive applications 100% of the time, applications that require top-tier processing speed - most of this data is backup for niche analysis, scenarios that don’t require perfect uptime.With this quarter’s release, Seagate has proven to the market that while demand for HDDs is no longer in its heyday, it can still appropriately cover the non-premium segments of the storage market. HDD shipments rose 5% for Seagate in the current quarter, and its average storage size per unit is up as well."
Seagate Technology: A Dividend Opportunity Or A Value Trap?,Oct. 2.17,"Executive SummaryAfter a period of extreme outperformance against major equity-market benchmarks since 2009, positive performance for Seagate Technology (STX) reversed (after Dec-2014) and a price drop of approximately 50% followed. As a result, and given the generous dividend policy and attractive valuation metrics of the stock, dividend-oriented investors and value hunters are paying close attention.Figure 1. Seagate Stock Price and VolumeOn the other hand, given idiosyncratic company issues with deteriorating revenue and prospects, as well as the questionable corporate strategy over the last year, there is a significant short interest even after the considerable correction that has already taken place. The situation clearly reflects major concerns about the future of the company and its ability to generate positive cash flows in a sustainable manner and of course, high enough to support present-level dividend payout.Company OverviewFor those not familiar with the company, Seagate Technology is a provider of electronic data storage equipment and solutions. The Company focuses on the production of hard disk drives (HDDs) and to a lesser extent, solid state drives, solid state hybrid drives, and others. Its storage technology portfolio also includes storage subsystems and high-performance computing solutions. Its products are designed for applications related to enterprise servers and storage systems, client compute applications and client non-compute applications. Seagate designs and fabricates various components found in its disk drives, including read/write heads and recording media."
"Seagate's 6.4% Yield Is Attractive, But Is It A Buy?",Nov.22.17,"IntroductionSeagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) released better than expected first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings. The earnings suggest signs of stabilization for its HDD business. As a result, its shares climbed upward and reached its three-month high of $39.42 on November 17. Its 6.4% yield remains attractive. However, both of its revenue and free cash flow generated continued to decline year over year. In addition, Seagate's better than expected earnings may be due to elevated NAND flash prices that slow down the adoption rate for SSDs. If NAND flash supply and demand reverses, Seagate's core HDD business may be in danger of losing more revenue. Hence, I would be cautious investing in Seagate's shares.STX data by YChartsRevenue Still DecliningDespite better than expected earnings release, I am still concerned as Seagate's Q1 fiscal 2018 revenue continued to decline year over year. Even with more exabytes shipped than last quarter, it still cannot make up the loss of revenue due to rapid decline in storage pricing. As a result, its past quarterly revenue declined to about $2.6 billion, or a decline of 5.9% year over year. This would be two straight quarters of year over year decline. Seagate's revenue also continued to decline year over year. In Q1 fiscal 2018, its total HDD units were down 5%."
Should You Buy Seagate's Safe 8.2% Yield?,Sep.13.17,"Investment ThesisShares of Seagate (STX) have not done well in the past six months, and the company posted another disappointing quarterly report in late July. Its revenue continued to decline due to weak HDDs demands. However, the recent decline in Seagate shares has elevated its dividend yield to over 8%. We think the dividend is sustainable in the near term, based on our free cash flow analysis. However, as the revenue continues to decline, there is a possibility that we will see a cut. Along with the return we estimated based on the target price calculation, we do not think we should initiate a position at this price.Source: StockCharts.comWhy is Seagate Stock Price Declining?Let us first take a closer look at why the stock price has been performing poorly. The reason of the poor performance in the past half year was due to the company's poor fundamentals. Its revenue has been declining for 3 straight years. Excluding the sight gain in 2015, the company's revenue has been on a decline since its fiscal 2012. The chart below shows Seagate’s quarterly revenue in the past 2 years, and we can see it continues to decline. Its Q4 fiscal 2017 revenue was $2.41 billion, down 9% YoY and 10% from its previous quarter."
"Seagate: Strong 8% Yield, Backed By Leader In Enterprise Hard Drives",Sep. 4.17,"Seagate Technology plc (NASDAQ:STX), the Dublin-based maker of computer storage products, has seen better days. The stock has cratered from a high of $50 in early 2017 to the low $30s today, leaving many investors to ask: ""What happened?""The primary answer is SSDs, or solid state drives, threatening the company's traditional strength in hard drives (we'll get into the technical differences a little later). SSDs, prized for their computing speed, are deployed in almost all consumer-facing products today, including phones, tablets, and laptops. This explosion in SSD demand, however, has led to a worldwide shortage in NAND flash (the primary component in SSDs) and price spikes, leaving the lower end of the market open to cheaper hard disk drives (HDDs).Nevertheless, the market has a short-term orientation, and SSD competition ate into Seagate's fiscal year, disappointing investors and sending the stock spiraling down. See the stock's YTD chart below:STX data by YChartsIn the month of August, Seagate tested 52-week lows multiple times and found support at $30. Bear in mind that at this price, the stock trades at ~12x trailing P/E and less than 10x forward consensus EPS of $3.69, according to Yahoo Finance's average of 28 covering analysts."
"Seagate Crashes, What Now?",Jul.26.17,"Investors in Seagate Technology (STX) are likely experiencing déjà vu after the stock dropped more than 16% in Tuesday trading, which almost exactly mirrors the more than 16% decline in share price after the most recent prior earnings report for Q3 2017. The company reported Q4 2017 earnings that significantly underwhelmed expectations, missing badly on EPS, providing weak guidance, bidding adieu (again) to its CEO of 16 years, though not all at once, Steve Luczo, and failing to cover the dividend payment with organic free cash flow. While investors might not want to sell shares just yet, in my opinion the short-term picture looks bleak and the long-term picture even bleaker.As I know it will be a hot topic of discussion in the comments section, I'll preempt the inevitable ""you were wrong on STX before so you're wrong now too"" responses by saying, yes, I turned out to be incorrect on the stock in the $20 range and as it rose. All I ask is that readers look at the content of the article with an open mind, and if you disagree with my points that's perfectly alright. Let's just keep the focus of the discussion where it should be: on Seagate.I'll just quickly summarize the earnings report and then highlight the parts I think are most important to investors. Seagate reported Q4 revenue of $2.41 billion, a decline of 9% YoY and $160 million below consensus estimates, and EPS of $0.65, which missed estimates by a whopping 34 cents and fell by 4 cents YoY. Additionally, gross margin of 28.9%, while up 310 bps YoY, came in well below the 31% projected by management on the Q1 conference call."
Seagate Technology will cut 500 jobs,"Dec. 11, 2017 4:51 PM ET",Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) plans to reduce its global headcount by approximately 500 employees. The cuts will be substantially completed by the end of FY18.Seagate expects a related pre-tax charge of about $50M.Cost savings will total $65M on an annual run-rate basis. Seagate expects to recognize the savings at the beginning of the March quarter. Previously: Seagate announces AI-enabled hard disk drive (Oct. 30)See more on FinTech Thematic ETFs »
Will Seagate Technology Stock Fall Below $30?,Aug.28.17,"Seagate Technology (STX) disappointed investors when the company reported poor quarterly earnings last month. At a share price of $31.25, the stock now offers a dividend that yields a seemingly unsustainable 8.06 percent. Similarly, GameStop (GME) reported weak results and its stock fell. Investors are questioning the electronic gaming retailer’s dividend yield sustainability of 7.84%. But for Seagate, the company’s stock price is in danger of falling lower due to its future prospects. Worries over the impact of a dividend cut on its share price are secondary.Seagate commanded around 40% of the hard disk market share in 2016. It lost a few points earlier this year and is in danger of losing more if Western Digital’s (WDC) deal to control the chip unit from Toshiba succeeds. Despite the headwinds, Seagate is optimistic. It expects to get half the Exabyte share (10TB – 12TB market) by the end of this year. Cloud storage and hyperscale markets continue to grow. This will drive hard drive demands. Management is comfortable with the HDD product mix and believes the storage sizes (from 2TB and up to 16TB) will satisfy customer needs.Strong quarterly resultsIn the fiscal fourth-quarter, Seagate reported a healthy gross margin of 29.5%. It generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations:With 289.7 million shares outstanding and a dividend of $2.52/share, Seagate has plenty of cash flow to cover the current dividend. The company also has around $8.80 per share in cash. The company forecasts next quarter’s revenue will be between $2.5 billion - $2.6 billion. Gross margin will match or improve at 29% to 33%. Operating costs will trend lower, from $415 million this quarter to $400 million or lower in the December quarter."
Western Digital Vs. Seagate Technology,Aug. 1.17,"According to IDC, the global hard disk drive (or HDD) storage market is dominated by three companies: Toshiba (TOSBY), Western Digital (NYSE:WDC), and Seagate Technology (STX):For full-year 2016, Western Digital retained the No. 1 spot in terms of both total unit sales and total petabytes shipped. That said, both Toshiba and Seagate nibbled away at WDC's market share as shown in the graphic above. But from the larger perspective, the HDD market exhibited flat year-over-year revenue growth and declining unit volumes.The real action is in the solid state disk (or SSD) market where companies that have NAND manufacturing capability (i.e. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Toshiba, and Western Digital) have a distinct advantage over those that do not. Which is why you don't see Seagate listed among the leaders in SSD market share:Western Digital's bold move to acquire SanDisk last year gave it an immediate and significant presence in the SSD market. It is second only to Samsung in SSD's and a few percentage points ahead of No. 3 Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)."

"Seagate announces new CEO, restructuring plan cutting 600 jobs","Jul. 25, 2017 9:59 AM ET","Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) announces some corporate changes alongside this morning’s earnings miss including the appointment of Dave Mosely to CEO, effective October 1.  Mosely previously served as the company’s President and COO.Current CEO Steve Luczo will become Executive Chairman. Seagate also announces a restructuring plan that will cut about 600 jobs, which the company expects to result in a $50M charge in 1Q18. Seagate says the restructuring will save about $90M on an annual run rate basis.Seagate shares are down 17.38%.

"Seagate: Short-Term Bearish, Long-Term Bullish",Jul. 5.17,"Seagate (STX) is likely to face negative pressure in the short term due to further revenue and operating margin decline. On the other hand, the opportunity for the long term is imminent stemming from favoring trends in the industry. Internet of Things, which means digitalization, data collection and the general movement to cloud, is going to create yet further demand for the data storage where HDD products are to benefit. And so, Seagate is well positioned to outperform in the long term. However, the company needs to demonstrate the ability to profit from the positive industry trends and stabilize the deteriorating business fundamentals. Steve Luczo, the CEO of the company, highlighted cautious optimism for business model stabilization, but I would wait for 2018 outlook to confirm his words.High volatilitySeagate has been very volatile during the last six years. The shares advanced from low of $7.7 in 2011 to the peak of $69.4 in 2014. After that, it reversed the bullish momentum and declined to a bottom of $17 in 2016. Consequently, the shares reached a high of $50 in April this year.Source: www.finance.yahoo.comAnd so, the investors could see the shares increase nine-fold, decrease 75 percent, increase three-fold and decrease 25 percent to current levels in a matter of six years. These huge swings have been caused by huge volatility in underlying profitability."
Seagate Technology: Dividend King,Jul.18.17,"Shares of Seagate Technology are up about 37% over the past year, but the stock remains undervalued in my view. Investors with a long term horizon would be wise to invest at these levels in anticipation of more gains ahead. I’ll review my bullish thesis by highlighting some elements of the company’s financial history, along with the prospects for the dividend. I’ll conclude by talking briefly about the stock relative to this market.Financial SnapshotWhen reviewing the financial history of this firm over the past eight years, it becomes obvious that it is a relatively volatile business. An investor in this firm should not expect the smoothest of rides. For instance, both revenue and net income have been quite volatile over the better part of a decade, jumping by upwards of 35% from year to year, only to plummet again.That said, things seem to be on the upswing at the moment, as the most recent three quarters are much better than the same period a year ago. Specifically, net income and earnings per shares are up approximately 270% from the prior period and the dividend has increased 5% over the same time horizon.In the face of this rather volatile situation, management seems to have never lost sight of the fact that they are working for shareholders. Since 2010, they have returned approximately $12.5 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends ($9.5 billion from buybacks, the balance from dividends). In my view, this is critical as it demonstrates that management is aligned with my interests. In the absence of this alignment, even the most wonderful business will be a shareholder graveyard in my view.I actually feel rather good about the level of debt on the balance sheet as it turns out. Not only does the company have 27% of the debt outstanding in cash at the moment, but most of it (~80%) is due after 2020, which suggests to me that there’s little risk of a solvency or a liquidity crisis on the horizon. This helps me sleep at night, relatively comfortable that the dividend will not likely be cut anytime soon."

Is Seagate Technology Worth Buying?,Jan.10.18,"Yesterday ValueStreet Research published a highly interesting article on Seeking Alpha indicating Seagate Technology (STX) could own as much as 4.3% of the private company Ripple. Ripple being a company that operates the Ripple protocol and owns a large quantity of XRP. We have a position in XRP in The Black Swan Portfolio, initiated around the $0.248 level.Because of the earlier research it is clear how important the information ValueStreet brought to the forefront actually is. With this article we are initiating an opportunistic trade, reflected in our portfolio, and putting ValueStreet’s discovery in context.What is Seagate Technology?Seagate Technology is one of two remaining larger players in the HDD market. HDD is the legacy technology for hard drives with a spinning component. You can literally hear it spin sometimes. Nowadays you will often see SSD drives - which stands for solid state drives - in higher end machines or other situations where costs don’t matter. Alternatively you will see a combination of an SSD and a HDD drive in a machine. The SSD will contain the boot information that needs to be accessed quickly while the HDD drive is used for filing away stuff that doesn’t need to get accessed all the time.After major consolidation Seagate Technologies is dividing up most of the HDD market together with Western Digital. What’s holding up well are enterprise datacenter sales. It is unrealistic to expect anything other than falling sales over the coming years. Seagate is a dying business and the question is whether the cash flows it is throwing off and the off chance they come up with an interesting innovation, while shrinking compensate for the risk of its demise accelerating.What is Ripple?"
"Seagate Technology May Own Over 4% Of Ripple, No Credit From The Street",Jan. 8.18,"Many words have been used to describe Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), a large manufacturer of hard disk drives: dated technology stock, stable dividend player, acquisition target.How about masterful cryptocurrency investor? It turns out that Seagate Technology invested in both the 2015 $28m Series A and 2016 $55m Series B rounds of Ripple, the company that owns 61% of XRP, a top-three cryptocurrency in the world.Source: Crunchbase.comAccording to CoinMarketCap, there are currently 100B total XRP in existence, of which Ripple (the company), owns 61B. At current prices (~$3/XRP), this is worth $183B on paper.Source: Coinmarketcap.comWe can hypothesize that Seagate has not cashed out its investments in Ripple, as it participated in both the Series A and Series B, and there hasn’t been a major liquidity event for the company. If you believe that it still maintains this investment, the question then becomes: What percentage of Ripple does it own and what is it worth relative to its $12.4b market cap?According to TechCrunch (Setting The Right Valuation For A Competitive Series A Round), “Generally, the valuation range results in the group of Series A investors taking 15-25 percent of the company.”"
"Seagate Had A Good Quarter, But Is It A Buy?",Feb. 9.18,"Investment ThesisSeagate Technology (STX) delivered an excellent Q2 fiscal 2018 thanks to strong storage capacity demand. The company continued to generate excessive free cash flow to cover its share buybacks and dividend. However, the company still faces long-term headwind as SSDs gradually replace HDDs even in the high-end enterprise market. Although Seagate’s current valuation is above its historical average, given the favorable outlook in the near term, its shares may continue to trend higher in the next few quarters.STX data by YChartsThe Positives In Seagate’s Q2 Fiscal 2018 EarningsStrong Storage Demand Lifted Seagate’s Revenue And MarginSeagate posted a surprise quarterly earnings report thanks to strong demand and capacity growth in its HDD business. This is evident in its total HDD capacity shipped. As the chart below shows, its total HDD capacity shipment reached 87.5 exabytes (“EB”). This was a growth of 17.2 EB quarter over quarter and 19.3 EB year over year (or 28% year-over-year growth). Its average capacity per drive increased to 2.2 terabytes (“TB”), or a growth of 29% year over year. I am quite surprised to see these decent numbers especially that demand in the previous several quarters has been pretty flat (see chart below)."
Seagate: Financial Analysis Brings Up Questions,Mar.16.18,"Seagate beat on EPS and revenue in December quarter. Operations seem to look strong.On January 21, Seagate (STX) reported the results for its Q2 FY 2018 ended December 2018. The results look good on paper: adjusted EPS increased 7% year-over-year, while the revenue returned to growth, even though 0.7% is a modest change.The growth in revenue was driven by strong HDD sales across client computing and enterprise segments. The corporation shipped 87.5 exabytes of capacity during the quarter, which is the highest quarterly level for Seagate. Importantly, 43% of this amount is attributable to the enterprise HDD market, which led to a higher average selling price - enterprise-grade storage tends to cost up to three times as high as the price of a consumer model with the same capacity.The nearline storage segment demonstrated the highest growth, with 35.1 exabytes shipped during the quarter, which is ""up 31% over last year's strong demand and up 75% from the December quarter two years ago."" Nearline drives are usually used as a bulk, cold storage for data that is not accessed frequently but still needed to be stored, and while digital data is replacing the paper archives, it seems that the demand for such solutions will grow in the near future. This makes the nearline market attractive for Seagate and will likely drive the performance of the company.Overall, HDD revenue was up 2% year-over-year in the December quarter.The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our Nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these environments.STX Shares Outstanding data by YChartsSTX data by YCharts"

Seagate Technology: Not Priced For Ripple Potential,Jan.31.18,"Seagate Technology (STX) withstood the market sell-off on Tuesday due to a big FQ2 beat. The stock has rallied substantially since the early January call that Ripple provided a catalyst for the stock, so the key signal is the yields at these higher stock prices.Ripple ImpactAs a refresher, the market identified a few weeks back that Seagate Technology had a large position in Ripple Labs that controls a majority of the XRP cryptocurrency. At the time, digital currencies were all the rage and the position was valued in the multi-billions.Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini was cautious on the position, but the analyst still estimated a value of $2.5 billion to $5.0 billion. In the ensuing weeks, XRP is down over 50% to $1.18.Source: coinmarketcap.comThe Ripple position held by Seagate Technology is down more in the $1.0 billion to $2.5 billion range now. The company didn't provide a lot of details on the FQ2 earnings call other than to confirm the investment.A few years ago, we made an investment in Ripple, a company driving technology innovation for distributed ledger and block chain use cases. We believe the proliferation of these companies will create tremendous amounts of data, require high levels of data integrity, and will alleviate friction in global financial operations and other important use cases that require the transfer of value with improved agility and transparency. While recent attention is on the valuation of the XRP crypto assets, we believe Ripple has a real and robust block chain technology platform, a defined and validated use case for XRP, and a leading management team.STX data by YCharts"
Seagate Tech: Large Yield With A Ripple Catalyst,Jan. 9.18,"Seagate Technology (STX) has long traded on dividend investor radars as the large dividend combined with stock buybacks captivates interest. The problem for long-term investors remains the volatile disk drive business, but do investors have a cryptocurrency cushion this time around?Massive YieldsWhile storage demands continue to explode, Seagate Tech has continuously struggled to sell their products for premium prices leading to stagnating sales. Revenues have been in continual decline since the peak in 2012.Source: Rocket FinancialAnalysts forecast FY18 sales of $10.3 billion so the trend isn't about to improve. The good part of the equation is that Seagate Tech consistently generates free cash flows allowing for large capital returns.The tech company currently pays a 5.5% dividend yield and repurchases shares on a regular basis. The net payout yield that combines the dividend yield and the net stock buyback yield sits around 9.5%.STX data by YChartsThe large yield was recently one of the top 5 in the market. The one major hiccup with the yield is that Seagate Tech has consistently added debt in the last few years to repurchase shares.The net debt position is now at $2.7 billion, which is creeping up for a stock only worth $12.4 billion. In the last quarter, the company returned $350 million to shareholders while only generating $237 million in cash from operations.STX Net Total Long-Term Debt (Quarterly) data by YCharts"
Western Digital: Lagging Behind Seagate For No Good Reason,Jan.23.18,"The market has two main players in the hard disk drive (HDD) arena: Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX). Despite these stocks historically moving rather close in tandem with each other - as they both occupy a near carbon-copy of each other's businesses - their performance has diverged rather noticeably in the first month of 2018.As seen in the chart below, Seagate is up 27% since the start of this year - making it one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 - while Western Digital, while still posting above-index returns, has lagged far behind its cousin. The central thesis of this article is that while there are some company-specific forces at play that are pushing Seagate up (specifically, its investment in Ripple), it's not enough to justify its outperformance relative to Western Digital. With Seagate hinting at strength in the HDD market that should also be a great tailwind to Western Digital, the latter will likely see a meaningful jump as it catches up to Seagate in the near term, creating a buying opportunity before Western Digital's January 25 earnings call.WDC data by YChartsWDC PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts"
"Seagate: A Good Quarter, But Doesn't Excuse Valuation",Jan.30.18,"Once a stock has momentum, it tends to be sustained. One such stock is Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX), the maker of hard disks and hard drives that has come roaring back in the past few months after the majority of the market had left it for dead. It turns out that the HDD business isn't dying after all (well - it is slowly declining in favor of higher performance flash memory products, but there's still a huge market for the cheaper HDD alternatives - particularly in the enterprise), and Seagate also had an additional trick up its sleeve: a purported ownership stake in Ripple, news of which first broke on Seeking Alpha.(A quick update on Ripple before we turn to fundamental topics - while the company did allude to its investment in Ripple during its earnings call, it didn't disclose its exact stake. Recent Wall Street research suggests the stake might not be that large.)Here's what Dave Morton, Seagate's CFO, had to say about Ripple on the earnings call:A few years ago, we made an investment in Ripple, a company driving technology innovation for distributed ledger and block chain use cases. We believe the proliferation of these companies will create tremendous amounts of data, require high levels of data integrity, and will alleviate friction in global financial operations and other important use cases that require the transfer of value with improved agility and transparency.

6 Reasons Western Digital Has 20% More Upside,Mar.13.18,"Ever since shares of Micron Technology (MU) broke out past the $50 level and skyrocketed again when an analyst set a target price of over $100, tech investors are on the prowl for the next undervalued stock. Western Digital (WDC) comes to mind. The hard drive manufacturer, which also broke out from the $80-$85 trading range, trades at above $100 but still has plenty more upside.There are six reasons WDC stock could continue moving higher.1) Western Digital’s Valuation Compared To SeagateAt a 7.88x forward P/E and 15.3x P/E, Western Digital is discounted compared to its competitor, Seagate Technology (STX). Seagate is valued at a 12.3x forward P/E and a 27.4x P/E. The latter has a debt/equity profile of 4 times compared to the 1x debt/equity for Western Digital. The undervaluation in the hard drive maker did not make sense when the stock traded at $80 and still makes little sense at above $100/share.Strong storage demand continues to act as a tailwind for the sector. Western Digital generated strong operating cash flow in its fiscal second quarter. Non-GAAP earnings topped $3.95 on revenue of $5.3 billion. Non-GAAP Gross margins of 43% were due to strong demand for enterprise storage and flash-based products.STX data by YChartsMU data by YCharts"

These 3 Cheap Dividend Stocks Have 5% Yields And Low P/E Ratios,"Jan. 17, 2018 6:12 PM ET","By Bob CiuraThe nearly unimpeded bull market over the past nine years, has rewarded investors who bought and held along the way. If there were a downside to rising stock markets, it would be that valuations have become stretched. The S&P 500 Index now trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.Along with rising valuations, the market’s stampede higher has caused dividend yields to shrink. The average dividend yield of the S&P 500 Index, is just 1.74% right now. This puts investors in a difficult position. At today’s prices, investors are getting less value and income, than at any point since the Great Recession.Fortunately, not all dividend stocks have such low dividend yields. There are many stocks with dividend yields of 5% or more. You can see our full list of established 5%+ yielding stocks here.The list also contains a few stocks that also have modest valuations, and high-quality businesses. This article will discuss three of the best stocks on the list, with 5% dividend yields, growth potential, and price-to-earnings ratios below 15.High-Yield Value Stock #1: AT&T Inc. (T)Dividend Yield: 5.4%Price-to-Earnings Ratio: 12.5AT&T not only has a 5% dividend yield, but it also raises its dividend each year. On December 15th, AT&T increased its quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share. This is its 34th consecutive year of dividend increases.

Western Digital: Value And Yield In Technology,Jan. 6.18,"Technology and value are two categories that seemingly don't belong together in today's market - investors have to search into the deepest, oldest pockets of the industry to find value. A lot of those companies are dying - but I don't think that's true of Western Digital (NYSE:WDC), the chipmaker whose single-digit P/E ratio suggests that the business is at risk.Western Digital is actually a rather remarkable company in that it's standing firmly in its core hard drive turf (along with Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), a company I also like) and maintaining its #1 market share in HDDs and growing its exabyte shipments, while at the same time aggressively pursuing growth in NAND flash technology. Its protracted dispute with Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY) over the sale of its flash manufacturing unit has come to an end, giving Western Digital a clear path for growth in the flash business.In this sense, Western Digital is somewhat analogous to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft's legacy Office and Windows businesses aren't growth stars anymore either - it's hanging on to market share in those areas while chasing growth in Azure infrastructure and Dynamics cloud apps. Microsoft has been a stellar performer in the markets lately, rising nearly 2x in the past two years. Western Digital's HDD and flash businesses can be thought of in the same way - eventually, the company will have its day in the sun.WDC PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts"

Western Digital: Unfairly Sold On Strong Quarter,Jan.26.18,"Over the past few months, it seems that Western Digital (NYSE:WDC) remains a stock that investors love to hate. It's true that Western Digital has had its fair share of issues over the past year, but it is more or less resolved: the Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY) dispute has been settled, giving Western Digital a steady pipeline of flash supply; its core hard drive business is showing surprise strength, a trend confirmed by rival Seagate (NASDAQ:STX); and a strong earnings quarter/guidance release has confirmed a strong year ahead for the company. So why is the stock trading down after-hours on the back of a solid quarter?WDC Price data by YChartsTo be fair, Western Digital quickly recovered the majority of the post-earnings selloff that triggered immediately after its release. But after already trading behind Seagate's valuation, and after buoyant results across the industry from the likes of SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF), there's no reason Western Digital should be trading down. In all fairness, it should be trading up towards the $90s.The post-earnings selloff, in my view, presents a strategic buying opportunity into a company that has long been undervalued. Memory trends look stable heading into 2018, and most industry observers share the opinion that the cycle won't start turning sour until sometime in 2019. Trading at a P/E of just ~6x (based on the company's fresh FY18 EPS view of $13.50-14), and with financials that are showing consistent top-line growth along with earnings expansion, Western Digital seems to be a deal that's too good to pass up."
