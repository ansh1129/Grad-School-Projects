What Is Netflix Really Worth?,"Feb 27, 2013 at 4:30PM","Hi, my name is Anders. I'm a Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) bull, and not the least bit ashamed of it.I've been known to compare the digital video expert's current stock prices with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), circa 2003. Skeptics point to Netflix's expectation of negative cash flows in 2013 and say the company is doomed. Well, Apple's cash ran red in 2003, too, as the iPod/iTunes business found its feet and Steve Jobs was cooking up the iPhone. Five years later, the stock had jumped 2,700% as Apple's early investments paid off in spades.Yes, I see a similar story shaping up for Netflix. The company is building a fantastic future right now. It's expensive, but you gotta spend money to make money.I'd like to walk you through three possible versions of the next five years. In one, CEO Reed Hastings achieves everything he ever dreamed of. In another, pretty much everything goes wrong. The third tale balances risks against opportunity, and is the most likely scenario in my opinion.And then I'll tell you what Netflix is worth under each of these scenarios.THREE POSSIBLE PROFIT FUTURES FOR NETFLIX. THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS STICKING CLOSE TO THE YELLOW LINE.Dream a little dreamHastings learned his lesson from the Qwikster debacle and plays his cards to perfection from now on. House of Cards is an Emmy-winning hit that launches a 10-year franchise, followed by other top-quality shows in every genre that matters. Whether you like witty sitcoms, science fiction drama, or gory horror, Netflix has you covered with exclusive content. Only the best scribes, helmers, and thespians need apply, because this is high-budget, high-quality stuff that can stand up to HBO's finest.On the strength of a generally well-rounded content portfolio with the added spice of award-winning exclusive shows, subscribers sign up and stick around like never before. By 2018, Netflix reaches 84 million American households.The same factors accelerate the company's overseas growth as well. All this extra money in the bank enables quicker rollouts in new markets. Netflix blankets Europe by 2014, turns a reliable profit on international operations by 2015, and jumps to Southeast Asia the same year. In 2018, the company has 78 million international accounts and 162 million total subscribers.The result? Streaming operations generate something like $7.4 billion in operating profit just five years from now. The company will be a fully mature media giant by then, equally adept at content distribution, production, and technology. Hastings might start running video-on-demand operations for cable companies by then. Movie-themed theme parks, maybe.It would be a bit early to call Netflix a threat to Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) at this point, but check again in 2023. The company will eventually have more money than it could deploy in its current business model and would simply have to diversify into a complete media package, just like the House of Mouse. If you're going to copy anybody, might as well stick with the industry's best.Oh, but everything cannot possibly go as planned. What if absolutely nothing works instead?Nightmare in Los GatosUh-oh. House of Cards is a critical success (already proven) but doesn't do diddly-squat for Netflix's subscriber hunt. Every original show bombs or slips away, and Hastings stops making them as soon as the existing commitments have been filled. If anything, the grand experiment only increases subscriber churn.Bidding wars with Hulu and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) limit what movies and TV shows Netflix can get its hands on, and every important deal falls into the enemy's hands. Amazon is bigger and richer, after all. Hulu is owned by three Hollywood studios. One little DVD-powered upstart can't possibly put up a fight. Hastings expects to get at least 60 million subscribers in the long run but misses that goal with just 54 million accounts in 2018.The same story plays out in South America and Western Europe. Growth is slow and painful, not to mention expensive. Operating costs balloon, and Netflix would be lucky to reach France and Germany by 2016. Local rivals and some more Amazon resistance further limit overseas growth. That's 41 million non-U.S. subscribers in 2018, or 95 million overall.This time, costs escalate out of control and the entire operation in still unprofitable in five years. Revenues may be booming in comparison with 2013, but at what cost? Forget about diversification and world domination -- at this point, Netflix should count itself lucky if Coinstar (NASDAQ:OUTR) would buy its DVD business for a quick cash infusion. Amazon is beating Netflix in every streaming market is cares to enter, Coinstar (now simply renamed Redbox) owns the physical media market worldwide, and Netflix has nothing going for it.Busted, broken, dead.That's not going to happen, either. Let's get real.The real worldSome of those original shows work out, and some don't. A handful become lasting franchises with repeatable business value, and they make a measurable difference to subscriber acquisition and loyalty. But some sink without a trace and are never seen again. Just like in the traditional cable TV world, failure is the norm. But the hits are at least worth the trouble.Bidding wars and rivalries turn out to be healthy for the newborn streaming industry overall. Amazon wins some deals, Hulu others, new entrants grab a few tasty morsels. But Netflix finds enough quality stuff to get by and is not forced to overbid on potentially irrelevant items. When the price rises too high, Hastings will walk away, like he did from Starz and Downton Abbey. The studios love having a healthy second market and are not shy about offering an even-handed selection of exclusives to keep the bidders bidding.That's enough to reach 74 million American subscribers in 2018.Elsewhere, Netflix continues to invest in new geographic markets with a steadily growing cash inflow setting the pace. Add a handful of Western European countries next year, and then cover that continent two years later. The existing territories mature in a solid but not explosive manner. And so Netflix reaches 59 million overseas subscribers in 2018, or 133 million including the United States.Costs increase but don't run out of control. In five years, Netflix makes $3.2 billion in operating profit from streaming operations.This is the most likely scenario in my eyes.What does it all mean?Note that I kept this discussion simple. I'm not counting on seeing Netflix raise prices along the way, even though the company could probably get away with adjusting its price tags for inflation. Neither do I expect the company to sell any new products, like game rentals or pay-per-view premium movies. The ultra-high-definition and 3D services are treated as freebies with a regular $8 subscription. The profitable but shrinking DVD service is given no value at all, even though it certainly isn't worthless. I've chosen to err on the side of caution. These estimates are conservative, except for that pie-in-the-sky 100% success scenario.A discounted cash flow analysis of the worst-case scenario would put a $7.1 billion total price tag on the company, or $126 per share. The stock trades 45% above that level today. I see this level as a fundamental long-term support. Assuming that Hastings doesn't do anything crazy to break the company in ways I haven't thought of yet, I would absolutely buy more Netflix shares below $126. There's no reasonable justification for prices lower than that. None at all.The super-duper future is equally unlikely to materialize, but it's a useful exercise anyhow. The intrinsic value of the stock would be $118 billion, or $2,114 per share. That's an easy 10-bagger in five years, in the same ballpark as Apple's mid-2000s run to the stars.But yeah, the middle-of-the-road outcome is the real deal. If you forced me to do a Monte Carlo analysis of Netflix, I'd give this track an 80% probability, with 10% to each of the other cases.Here, the company's intrinsic value is $538 per share for a $30 billion market cap. Share prices need to triple before hitting that level, or you could see it as a 66% margin of safety. Even if I assume that the growth story will hit a brick wall in five years, it's still a $306 stock. That's with all the conservative caveats above. Any (reasonably handled, unlike Qwikster) subscription price increases, new product ideas, or even a DVD revival would just add more value on top.So this is why I see Netflix as the next Apple-style hypergrowth stock. It's already one the most successful picks in CAPS, and the largest individual holding in my personal real-money accounts. I plan to ride Netflix over the next few years like early fans rode Apple 10 years ago.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Can Marvell Technology Beat Out Broadcom and LSI?,"Nov 19, 2013 at 2:30PM","Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ:MRVL) will release its quarterly report on Thursday, and investors have seen the stock soar to its highest levels of 2013 as interest rises in the company. Yet even as certain technology stocks have started to gain traction among investors recently, can Marvell outpace rivals Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM) and LSI (NASDAQ:LSI) to capture the maximum growth available from the industry?Marvell Technology has three main segments in which it operates, making products related to the networking, storage and mobile and wireless businesses. In storage, its hard-disk-drive controllers have provided a regular stream of cash for years. But the increasing importance of mobile and wireless solutions has given Marvell the chance to sell connectivity-enhancing chips and integrated processors for smartphones and other mobile devices. Networking is also an area of high potential for Marvell, as Broadcom and other competitors have also seen great success there. Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Marvell Technology Group over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.Stats on Marvell Technology GroupAnalyst EPS Estimate$0.25Change From Year-Ago EPS25%Revenue Estimate$872.81 millionChange From Year-Ago Revenue11.8%Earnings Beats in Past 4 Quarters3SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCECan Marvell earnings keep growing?Analysts have boosted their views on Marvell earnings in recent months, raising their October-quarter estimates by $0.01 per share and their full-year fiscal 2014 projections by $0.05 per share. The stock has climbed about 7% since mid-August.Marvell worried investors early in the quarter, despite reporting July quarter earnings results that by several measures were stronger than most had expected. Storage controllers for both hard-disk drives and solid-state drives saw solid growth, and successes in mobile could arguably offset the challenges that Marvell faces in its networking segment. Still, Marvell's failure to keep up with Broadcom's networking growth led investors to bid shares lower.In addition, Marvell looks increasingly likely to lose a major legal verdict. The company had hoped to have a federal court grant a new trial to overturn an outstanding $1.17 billion jury verdict in a suit that Carnegie Mellon University had filed in a hard-drive infringement case, but that request was denied in September. Marvell intends to appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit once its post-trial motions are all resolved, but it's uncertain whether it will fare better at the appellate level.But one major issue that emphasizes Marvell's potential advantages over Broadcom and LSI came earlier this month, when rumors that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts had bought a 5% position in Marvell raised speculation about a full-out takeover bid. KKR believes that Marvell could win its lawsuit, freeing up more than $1.7 billion in cash to help make a leveraged buyout a lot easier to manage. Moreover, KKR's confidence that the decline in the PC market won't hurt Marvell's hard-disk drive business as much as many fear helped give shareholders the bullishness to drive share prices higher.In the Marvell earnings report, watch to see the extent to which the company keeps relying on Western Digital, which accounted for almost a quarter of Marvell's overall sales in its previous fiscal year. If it can continue the trend of getting rivals like Seagate on board, then Marvell could press its advantage against LSI and Broadcom well into the future.Click here to add Marvell Technology Group to My Watchlist, which can find all of our Foolish analysis on it and all your other stocks."
Nike Delivers Solid Results And The Market Yawns,"Dec 20, 2013 at 11:05AM","So much attention is given to the growth trajectory of Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) that investors sometimes forget that the world's largest maker of sports apparel, Nike (NYSE:NKE), still demonstrates strong growth and innovation every quarter. This trend continued as Nike's second-quarter earnings came in just ahead of analyst estimates, thanks to 8% revenue growth and increased gross margins.Nike delivers a solid quarter Nike delivered solid results across the board. On a currency-adjusted basis, Nike grew revenue in each of its geographic regions; of particular note was the strong 15% growth in Western Europe, a stronghold of Adidas (NASDAQOTH:ADDYY). Nike's 5% revenue growth in China may not seem like much, but it certainly represents a positive turnaround to a concerning trend in recent quarters.Thanks to a favorable mix in sales toward higher-margin products, Nike was also able to increase gross margins 140 basis points; this drove diluted earnings per share of $0.59, a penny higher than expectations.So why the lackluster reaction from the market? Investors are concerned with Nike's 14% uptick in selling, general, and administrative costs. While it is typically not a good thing when expense growth outpaces revenue growth, a little more digging is required to get a true understanding of this number. On the earnings call, CEO Mark Parker attributed this increase to investments that will drive future growth; these investments take the form of both ""demand creation"" projects such as marketing ramp-up leading into the Olympics, World Cup, and other major sporting events and ""strategic initiatives"" that develop new products in growth areas such as digital products (e.g., the Fuelband).Spending that will drive growth by attracting customers and creating innovative new products can hardly be considered a negative for anyone taking a long-term view of the company. Fuelband has taken a leading position in the growing integration of digital technology into fitness. Meanwhile, ramped-up marketing expense for major international events like the Olympics and World Cup present Nike with the opportunity to further gain market share in markets where Adidas has a leading position.Nike's valuation is more attractive than Under Armour'sUnder Armour is growing faster than Nike, so it is logical that shares of Under Armour deserve a premium. However, the extent of the premium is often debated; as illustrated by this side-by-side comparison, shares of Nike remain far more attractive even on a growth-adjusted basis:Valuation Metric NKE UATTM revenue (in billions) $25.8 $2.2Expected revenue growth 8.8% 21.9%TTM price-to-sales ratio 2.71 4.23      TTM earnings (in billions) $2.7 $0.1TTM price-to-earnings ratio 26.41 62.45Expected earnings growth 12.7% 21.6%PEG ratio 2.03 2.72SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE, DEC. 19, 2013. TTM = TRAILING-12-MONTH.As evidenced by the difference in PEG ratios, investors are placing a huge premium on the expectation that Under Armour will generate earnings growth at a rate almost double that of Nike. Investors often equate growth potential with market-beating returns; while this can certainly be the case, shares of Nike have kept pace with Under Armour over the past year, as illustrated below:NKE TOTAL RETURN PRICE DATA BY YCHARTS.The reason Nike's shares aren't moving higherAfter it delivered another solid quarter and remaining more attractively valued than Under Armour, investors may wonder why shares of Nike aren't moving higher. Quite simply, Nike's performance is already priced into the shares; the company is trading at  historically high price-to-sales ratio, as shown below:NKE PS RATIO (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.Similarly, shares of Nike are at the high end of the company's historical price-to-earnings ratio range:NKE P/E RATIO (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.At the top of its recent valuation range, it will be hard for shares of Nike to move dramatically higher in the near term; 60% annual increases like those registered in the past year are unlikely to repeat, barring transformative changes to the company. Accordingly, the recent rise in the company's share price will continue to result in the market ""yawning"" at solid results given that further valuation multiple expansion is hard to justify.10 stocks we like better than NikeWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Yum! Brands: A Global Growth Story,"Sep 11, 2013 at 3:08PM","  Investors have lost focus on just how profitable and valuable Yum! Brands' (NYSE:YUM) growth prospects truly are.  Despite the 2013 profitability setbacks and scandals in China, the company's most important market, Yum! Brands is poised for a long-term growth.  By 2015, the company hopes to earn 75% of its profit from its global operations, giving investors a unique opportunity to benefit.China's short-term and long-term outlookI believe that the company will recover from the chicken scandal and avian flu scare sooner rather than later. This belief is based on a similar recovery it saw in 2005/2006 following the discovery of a cancer-causing Sudan Red IV in KFC which came only a year after the 2004/2005 avian flu flare ups. After each incident, the company has been able to stem its losses in traffic and drive customers back to their stores sooner than its peers.I believe the latest incidents (the chicken supply scandal in December 2012, and the avian flu scare in February 2013) will also pass and customers in China will resume their dining habits at the various Yum! Brands restaurants. Management is optimistic that a recovery will occur as early as the fourth quarter of 2013.  Analysts at Stifel have shown how the company has recovered from prior incidents in the past.    Longer term, I believe that the Chinese restaurant sector is a top investment opportunity. To understand this requires a brief overview of the political system. The Communist Party of China (CPC) owns and operates the vast majority of businesses, and its primary political objective is to deliver economic growth without political unrest. This system has set up a situation where the vast majority of industries are dominated by State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) that drive the vast majority of economic growth in China and have only modest returns on capital through a pursuit of ""growth for a growth's sake.""Now, here is where the restaurant industry comes in. The restaurant industry is the ideal foreign-firm sector in China because it is not dominated by these SOEs as individual restaurants are small, hard-to-execute projects. As a result, the restaurant sector does not compete directly against these SOEs presenting a tremendous opportunity for Yum! Brands (and its investors.)Major growth opportunities in IndiaInvestors should be bullish on the long-term growth of India, which has the potential to become a billion dollar business in the next five to ten years. The company has plans to operate 1,000 locations in India by 2015. The Indian market consists of over one billion people and as the economy continues grow, incomes will rise and drive more urbanization that will help India become a hotspot for western restaurant concepts. India is now its own separate reporting division with business growth that could potentially rival China, as the country is a growing economy that is predicted to have the world's largest consuming class within a decade can only be seen as a huge positive.  Yum! Brands happens to be one of the first movers in India along with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which is partnering 50/50 with Tata Global Beverages, the world's second largest manufacturer and distributor of tea and coffee. Together, the two giants operate 15 locations in Mumbai and Delhi known as ""Starbucks A Tata Alliance"" with plans to have 50 outlets in hospitals, educational institutions and corporate campuses by the end of 2013. Starbucks is also expected to roll out operations in untapped cities such as Bangalore and Chennai in the years to come.Competition is fierceMcDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is also aggressively expanding in China, and according to a Bloomberg article expects to hire 75,000 workers to supplement the 90,000 individuals that are already employed. McDonald's is planning to open 300 new stores in the country, bringing its total to 2,000. The company hopes that its expansion plans will gain market share as it is currently losing the battle to Yum! Brands in the most populated country in the world. In 2011, McDonald's had a 15.6% share of the fast food industry, as compared to Yum! Brands' much larger 39%.The battle over who will control China will heat up over the next few years. McDonald's holds the advantage of being the much larger company with over $2 billion in cash and can force a pricing war to gain market share, resulting in Yum! Brands lowering its prices and margins.  I believe that Yum! Brands' market-leading position will help the company deliver large profits for years to come. The competition might be heating up, but the fast food market is certainly large enough for all major competitors to benefit from.First mover in AfricaYum! Brands is also building a network in Africa that hasn't received as much attention from investors as it should. In South Africa, the company operates over 700 units and holds a larger company-owned presence in the remainder of the continent where stores are primarily franchised. KFC has been a major success thus far in Africa with virtually no competition from western or local concepts in many of the areas outside of South Africa. The company's sales performance and unit economics have been strong, letting it benefit from the competitive advantage of being an early mover in the region. Domestic business continues to improve alsoThe company began a major rebound in the U.S in 2012, driven by a turnaround of its Taco Bell business after a false lawsuit over its ground beef in 2011 led to almost a year of negative comps. The company introduced the highly successful Doritos Locos Tacos through a partnership with Frito-Lay. Earlier this year, Taco Bell launched the widely anticipated (and tasty) Cool Ranch flavor of Doritos Locos Tacos, yielding another major success. Management has noted that they are committed to rolling out new flavors of Doritos Locos Tacos and utilize the Frito-Lay partnership to create new menu items that combine flavors and products from the two companies.I believe that new product innovation can continue to drive solid same-store sales performance. The company's heavily franchised U.S strategy can allow it to take on additional leverage to create further shareholder value.Market is big enough for everyoneInvestors that aren't fully convinced of a Yum! Brands Chinese recovery should consider one of the company's largest competitors, Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) as it has been benefiting from the same international and domestic growth story.Domestically, the company has seen strong traffic growth driven by the continued success of the Handmade Pan Pizza and an ongoing expansion of digital and mobile apps that are available for 95% of all smart-phones sold in the U.S.Domino's Pizza doesn't have as large of a presence in China, but management noted in the most recent conference call that given the size of the opportunity, it is an area of focus though it is currently not a big driver of revenue.The pizza chain did show an impressive growth in the international market, however, delivering same-store sales growth of 5.8% while opening 116 new stores during the most recent quarter.ConclusionI believe that it is not too late for investors to purchase one of the world's best global growth companies at an attractive valuation. Yum! Brands has suffered recently from perceived safety issues in China. Analysts seem to be mixed on the future performance of the stock, with Street best price target of $105 coming from Stifel with a buy rating while Credit Suisse has a $77 target and an outperform rating.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

"What If Lululemon, Under Armour, and Nike Are All Overvalued?","Oct 26, 2013 at 9:05AM","Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) reported earnings Thursday, and while results were strong, shares tumbled. The stock fell as much as 7.9% even as the apparel-maker raised its outlook, and beat top- and bottom-line estimates on 26% sales growth. What seemed to throw off the market was the company's lower-than-expected preliminary guidance for 2014, as CFO Brad Dickerson said Under Armour was targeting the lower end of its 20% to 25% long-term revenue and operating income growth range.Shares of Under Armour have surged this year, gaining 74% before yesterday's sell-off. That jump has come on little more than delivering solid results, beating earnings estimates in each of its last five quarters, and growing its top line at a clip near 25%. But with that strong share price appreciation has come a vertigo-inducing valuation. Under Armour now trades at a trailing P/E of 58, and its forward P/E of 43 still bakes in high expectations.But this lofty valuation isn't just a trait of Under Armour stock. Its two primary rivals also carry steep price tags, as the chart below shows.CompanyMarket CapP/E RatioUnder Armour$8.4 billion58.4Nike (NYSE:NKE)$67.2 billion25.5lululemon athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU)$10.5 billion39.2Industry$86.1 billion30.4 (weighted average) SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE, AUTHOR CALCULATIONS.It's rare to find a $86 billion company trading at a P/E of 30, twice the long-term average of the S&P 500. Essentially, only a handful of tech stocks such as Amazon.com and Facebook are this large and expensive, and the market assigns them such valuation because of their monopoly-like position in fast-growing markets. By contrast, the apparel industry offers little in the way of an ""economic moat,"" as each company has primarily sought to distinguish itself with brand recognition and product quality.Is the sports apparel biz a zero-sum game for these players, or is there enough room in the market to make them all winners?Stretching to the limitAs the elephant in the room, with revenue dwarfing both Under Armour and Lululemon, Nike would seem to have the most to say about the industry's future. The Swoosh recently laid out a bold plan to reach $36 billion in sales by fiscal year 2017, a more than 40% increase from fiscal 2013. Nike said it expects $20 billion of those sales to come from North America and Western Europe, where it sees high-single-digit growth, and most of the rest to come from developing markets, including China and Eastern Europe, where it sees growth in the low double digits. It expects e-commerce sales to nearly double to $8 billion.In its presentation, Nike noted that the middle-class population in the so-called BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) will expand by 1 billion over the next decade, and also remarked that sports like running and basketball have never seen more interest around the world. Nike was also optimistic about the effect that hosting the World Cup and Summer Olympics would have on Brazil, a sport-loving country with a population of 200 million.Under Armour and Lululemon are much more focused on the North American market than Nike, but Nike was similarly optimistic about its home region, noting that sales have grown there by 40% over the last three years even as naysayers said that that market had already reached maturity.As Under Armour competes in many of the same categories as Nike, it will likely benefit from any market expansion in North America as demand for sports and exercise apparel increases.Lululemon, meanwhile, is a brand nearly synonymous with yoga, an activity that has exploded in popularity over the last decade. Money spent on yoga products has increased 87% over the last five years in the U.S., and the number of Americans who practice is increasing at a rate of 20% each year. Lululemon helps promote the ancient practice by offering free classes in its stores, and reimbursing employees for any outside classes that they take.Lululemon's next frontier appears to be abroad, where its initial showrooms and stores in Europe and Asia have gotten an overwhelmingly positive response.Notably, both Nike and Under Armour believe the women's market, Lululemon's forte, is a huge growth opportunity.Wearable technologyThough readers may think of Google Glass or smart watches when they hear the phrase ""wearable technology,"" companies like Nike and Under Armour are just as much a part of this transformative shift. With its Nike+ family of products such as its Fuelband, the sneaker king is taking performance measurement to the next level. The wristband tracks athletic activity, the intensity of your workout, and even monitors your sleep, giving you a Fuel score based on your total activity. The product is just one component of Nike+ , which the company calls ""an ecosystem of digital products and experiences designed to measure, motivate, and empower you to improve,"" Above all, Nike+ and the Fuelband serve as an example of an entirely new category Nike has been able to create simply by harnessing technological advances.Under Armour, similarly, makes no bones about its ambitions in wearable technology. In a new commercial, it tells viewers, ""The next great athletic innovation isn't available yet, but it's being built at Under Armour right now."" Among other ideas, the company is working on a shirt with lights built into it so runners or other users can be seen at night. Under Armour solicits such ideas at its annual ""Future Show,"" and CEO Kevin Plank is well aware of how fast things change in the industry, saying:Our consumers' expectations shift constantly higher and they count on their favorite brands to consistently take them someplace new. The company that we are building to deliver on that promise is in constant evolution. We are a different company every six months.Lululemon, on the other hand, has avoided the wearable technology field, a sensible move seeing as the brand is aligned with the spirituality of yoga. Still, the opportunity exists if it should so seek it.Foolish takeawayAll three of these companies are great brands, and their stocks' performance over the past five years reflects their strength.NKE DATA BY YCHARTS.Notably, all three have seen their share price appreciation outpace their earnings-per-share growth. Given that, we are likely to see more pullbacks in the future for these stocks like we saw today with Under Armour. Despite the likely multiple compression ahead, their brand strength and growth opportunities should be enough to enable them to outperform the market over the long run, though most likely not by the huge margins we've seen in the last five years."
Seagateâ€™s Shrewd SandForce Acquisition,"May 29, 2014 at 10:00PM","When Avago (NASDAQ:AVGO) purchased LSI a while back, it got with it a robust storage semiconductor business, as well as a networking chip business that seemed poised to grow. As part of that storage semiconductor business, Avago got its hands on a company that LSI had acquired just a few years ago called SandForce. SandForce was an up-and-coming vendor of solid-state drive-storage controllers, and helped the company stay competitive with Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL), as well as the in-house controller efforts at the various flash vendors.However, news broke today that Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), one of the two major players left in the hard disk drive business, would be buying SandForce from Avago for a cool $450 million in cash. Seagate, like rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), has been on a bit of a shopping spree with respect to any and all flash-related technologies. While hard disk drives will continue to be a veritable cash cow, neither Seagate nor Western Digital wants to be left out of the continued growth of flash.This is a good acquisitionLSI picked up SandForce for $370 million back in 2011. Back then, SandForce's controllers were continuing to gain traction, but were still relatively immature relative to some of the offerings from competitor Marvell, as well as some of the in-house solutions from the likes of Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF). Under LSI, SandForce likely had more financial room to breathe and, as a result, could be more competitive in the longer run.With this acquisition, Seagate gets a strong flash controller vendor, which will allow it to be a major player in both consumer and enterprise solid-state drive solutions. While Seagate is at a cost-structure disadvantage relative to a company that builds its own NAND (think Micron (NASDAQ: MU), Samsung, and Toshiba) because flash is easily the biggest part of the bill of materials, this is really only a hindrance in commodity-drive markets. In higher-end consumer and, more importantly, enterprise, the software and the controller are the key points of differentiation.Welcome to the club, SeagateWith Toshiba having picked up the remains of OCZ, which had a pretty credible in-house controller effort, and with Western Digital having picked up STEC, it's only natural that Seagate joins the party by picking up some world-class solid-state controller IP. Indeed, with the substantial cash flows that both hard disk drive vendors generate from this duopoly, it would be foolhardy for either to not be aggressive in picking up relevant flash assets.Impact on Marvell?One more angle is worth exploring, and may be expanded upon in a future article -- the impact on Marvell. Marvell is a leading vendor of hard disk drive controllers and has reported excellent growth from its solid-state drive controller business. The company estimates that it has roughly 50% of the controller market for such drives, and has indicated that the near-term demand outlook for this business is good.The longer-term question, however, is whether the merchant solutions that Marvell provides will ultimately be displaced by in-house solutions, or if the merchant model will ultimately prevail. The smaller, commodity SSD players (Corsair, Kingston, PNY, etc.) are unlikely to bring controllers in-house -- even Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) uses merchant controllers for its consumer products -- so that market is probably nice and wide open to Marvell. The drives that come from Seagate, Samsung, and others, on the other hand, will probably use in-house silicon. Time will tell how the market share dynamic between all of these players plays out.Foolish bottom lineSeagate is using its enormous cash flow from hard disk drives to buy technology and assets that it needs to thrive longer term. Hard disk drives aren't going away -- in fact, they'll probably continue to generate robust levels of cash for years to come; but in order to drive growth, both Seagate and Western Digital need flash strategies. It seems with their recent acquisition sprees, both Seagate and Western Digital are well positioned going forward."
Wal-Mart Makes a Splash in Money Transfers -- Will It Matter?,"Apr 19, 2014 at 10:00AM","Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) lowered the boom on yet another industry this past week. The world's largest retailer announced it would begin offering money-transfer services under the name Walmart-2-Walmart. The service will begin April 24, and is being provided with the help of Ria, the world's third largest money-transfer company and a subsidiary of Euronet Worldwide (NASDAQ: EEFT). SOURCE: WAL-MART PRESS RELEASEAs a result of the announcement, shares of MoneyGram (NASDAQ:MGI) and Western Union (NYSE:WU) took a dive, falling 18% and 5%, respectively. Moneygram stock took the news especially hard as it currently provides money transfer services for Wal-Mart. Western Union, meanwhile, says that 85% of its transfers involve a location outside the U.S, which will be safe from Wal-Mart's domestic-only offering. In characteristic fashion, Wal-Mart promised to undercut the industry pricing by up to 50%, promising two fee levels. For transfers of up to $50, Wal-Mart will charge $4.50; sending between $50 and $900 will cost $9.50. According to Wal-Mart's press release, competitor prices can range as follows:Money Transfer Amount  Competitors' Prices  Walmart-2-Walmart Price $0-$50 $4.75-$5.00  $4.50 $50-$200  $11-$12 $9.50 $400-$500  $34.50-$40  $9.50 $600-$700  $46-$58  $9.50 $800-$900  $57-$76  $9.50 SOURCE: WAL-MART PRESS RELEASE With annual sales approaching $500 billion, Wal-Mart isn't expecting money transfers to move the needle on its bottom line. The all-and-sundry chain is simply looking for a way to drive more traffic to its stores, and bring those customers underneath its umbrella. The strategy seems like a savvy one at a time when same-store sales are stumbling at the retail behemoth. In the past year, comparable sales at its U.S. locations, which make up more than 70% of its sales, fell 0.4%, sliding in all four quarters, and traffic at U.S. Wal-Mart locations dropped 1.7%.  Meanwhile, rivals like Amazon.com grew its top line by more than 20%, and even Costco saw 5% organic U.S. growth in the last six months.Taking a page out of Amazon's playbookAmazon has turned itself into an online empire by leveraging seemingly every competitive advantage it has. From a small online bookseller, the company has grown into a retail giant and a digital media kingpin, and a primary competitor of businesses ranging from Netflix to Apple to Barnes & Noble. With its massive size, real estate footprint, and economies of scale, Wal-Mart has similar competitive advantages, and the retailer has recently made a point of stretching those capacities, as we can see from the money-transfer gambit and other recent moves.Just a month ago, Wal-Mart stepped on video-game seller GameStop's turf, saying it would begin accepting used video-game trade-ins for credit, which sent GameStop shares down as much as 6% as a result. Similar to its entry into money transfers, Walmart's move is designed to drive traffic and other purchases rather than game trade-ins itself, a familiar strategy in the industry. Last week, Wal-Mart shook up another industry, announcing it would carry Wild Oats organic food products at a price point better than 25% lower than national organic brands. Not surprisingly, shares of Whole Foods dropped 4% on the day the news came out.An easy win?Of the three moves above, the money-transfer entrance seems to make the most sense. Wal-Mart is best known for its everyday low prices; customers tend to be lower-income Americans, the same consumers that are likely to use money-transfer services. According to Wal-Mart's press release, 28% of Americans or ""unbanked or underbanked,"" with military personnel and oil-field workers among those communities that most often take advantage of the service. The money transfer initiative is not Wal-Mart's first move into financial services, as the company, in 2012, partnered with American Express to sell prepaid Bluebird cards to customers. The chain also offers check-cashing, money orders, and tax prep services.  Still, its new rivals do not feel threatened by the announcement. In a statement, MoneyGram said it would not take any pricing actions as a result of Wal-Mart's entry, and that although Wal-Mart is its biggest customer, its share of revenue has been decreasing in the past five years. Western Union said its prices often match Wal-Mart's, and that its diverse offerings include online transfers and other services the retailer is not providing. With 500,000 locations around the world, Western Union is also much more accessible. Moneygram, meanwhile, has more than 275,000 agent locations globally. Foolish bottom lineWhile each of Wal-Mart's three recent moves has sent competitor stocks tumbling, Wal-Mart stock has barely moved. In fact, on none of the three days that the retailer made those announcements did its share price gain more than 1%. The moves are reminiscent of Amazon, which has made a habit out of beginning price wars in new industries; but Amazon, with its barely visible profits, does not need to be a model for Wal-Mart.The retail giant may not score any big wins with the above moves; but, like other successful businesses, it knows when it needs to adapt, and it's been wisely doing so in recent years with its expansion into groceries, the introduction of the smaller-footprint neighborhood market format, and by selling more alcohol. Walmart-2-Walmart won't replace Western Union or Moneygram, but it's a smart move for the retailer. With its size and economies of scale, Wal-mart has advantages in pricing and customer traffic over nearly every other business. Millions of Americans already shop at Wal-Mart, and they count on it for low prices. Nearly 10% of non-automotive retail dollars in the U.S. are spent at the retail giant. Walmart-2-Walmart may not juice the bottom line anytime soon, but the more reasons the company can give customers to walk through its doors, the better off it will be in the long run.      10 stocks we like better than Walmart Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is Dickâ€™s Sporting Goods Still a Good Investment?,"Mar 1, 2014 at 1:31PM","Americans love to spend money on outdoor recreation in two forms: the purchase of gear and vehicles for outdoor recreation, and on trips and travel. For every dollar spent on gear and vehicles, an estimated $4 is spent on trips and travel. The outdoor-recreation industry has the distinction of expanding even during the recession, notching about 5% annual growth during the period between 2005 and 2011. This industry in the U.S. is generating around $646 billion in yearly sales and 6.1 million direct jobs.Considering the industry's size and growth, it is a good idea to examine Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS), a prominent player in the outdoor sporting-goods segment, and see how it stacks up against peers like Cabela's (NYSE:CAB) and Big 5 Sporting Goods (NASDAQ:BGFV).Dick's is outperforming othersA look at revenue growth over the past five years, as shown in the chart below, clearly establishes Dick's as the leader of the pack, closely followed by Cabela's; Big 5 trails the others by a wide margin.DICK'S REVENUE (TRAILING-12 MONTHS) DATA BY YCHARTSIn the third quarter of fiscal 2013, Dick's reported strong performance in the athletic footwear and apparel and team-sports segments. This fueled comparable-store sales growth of 3.3%, on top of a 5.1% jump during the year-ago quarter, despite softness in the fitness and outdoor-apparel categories. On the back of positive comps and new store openings, revenue jumped 6.7% year over year.Looking aheadIn 2014, Dick's is planning to reallocate square footage to higher-growth categories including youth and women's apparel. However, during the fourth quarter, the company still expects cautious consumer spending.Retailers are quick to blame bad weather and weak consumer spending, and Dick's is no exception. It squarely blamed both for its bad second-quarter performance. The weather was particularly horrible toward year-end, and this could be a spoiler for the fourth quarter. Although Dick's witnessed good indicators for cold-weather outerwear during the third quarter, I think much of the optimism for the fourth quarter could be tempered as a result of inclement weather. If this happens, then this could be a buying opportunity as the stock declines.Dick's digital initiatives, including the e-commerce channel, could come to its rescue. In the third quarter, they accounted for 6.5% of revenue. The e-commerce channel has the advantage of round the clock access and ordering, even if the bad weather prevents consumers from going out and shopping. Dick's is increasing product offerings at various price points in the ship-from-store channel to bolster its e-commerce segment.Peers' movesCabela's did not blame the not-so-great weather when it posted its fourth-quarter results this month. However, declining sales of firearms and ammunition continued. As a result, consolidated comps declined 10.1% year over year. Excluding firearms and ammunition sales, comps were down 3.5% versus the year-ago quarter.Going forward, Cabela's expects sales to shift away from firearms and ammunition and into higher-margin categories like hunting apparel, footwear, men's casual apparel, and non-shooting hunting equipment. Also, its new format stores are outperforming the legacy store base by more than 50% in sales per square foot and more than 60% in profit per square foot. This reinforces the retail growth strategy of the company, and the new format stores will be a game changer going forward.Big 5 Sporting Goods' growth story is centered on a three-pronged strategy: e-commerce, new store openings, and increasing store efficiency. Expenses for its new e-commerce platform will have an earnings-per-share impact of $0.01 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. The platform is expected to roll out in fiscal 2014. This will allow direct-to-consumer purchases, leveraging the company's new distribution center.As a result of the new e-commerce platform rollout in 2014, Big 5 can address a larger market than its current store-based presence that's limited primarily to the western region. In addition, this may also allow it to expand its stores in other geographical regions as the brand gains traction in areas where it has no presence.Bottom lineAll three companies are focused on online sales for growth, but in my opinion Dick's looks to be in a solid position. Apart from the e-commerce initiative, the company is focused on pushing its higher-selling products that should result in higher sales. Also, with a P/E ratio of just below 20, Dick's isn't very expensive, and a forward P/E ratio of 16.7 means that there is bottom-line growth expected in the future."
3 Reasons to Choose Western Digital Corp Over SeagateTechnology PLC,"Jun 4, 2014 at 12:00PM","The storage drive industry is a duopoly with Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) leading the way. Both companies were on an equal footing last year with a 43% share of the hard-disk drive, or HDD market. However, Western Digital has scooted ahead with a 45% share, while Seagate lags behind with 40% of the market. And based on a few simple assumptions, I think this gap could widen further. Difference in performanceThe PC market is on the decline, so both Western Digital and Seagate are expected to see weakness in their business. There was a time when both companies were reporting terrific growth in their financials as the floods in Thailand restricted supply. But now, both storage companies reported a decline in earnings and revenue in their respective quarters.However, it seems Western Digital is the one that's doing better in a weak PC environment. In its last-reported third quarter, Western Digital's revenue was down just 1.6% year over year, while earnings dropped 4%. In comparison, Seagate's revenue dropped 3.4% and earnings fell 5%. Difference in fundamentalsA closer look at the two balance sheets also shows Western Digital's superiority. The company has more cash and lower debt, with figures of $4.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. So, Western Digital's debt is almost half of the amount of cash. The story is the opposite for Seagate, which has debt of $3.5 billion and cash of $2.3 billion. In addition, Western Digital's operating cash flow for the last year stands at $2.8 billion, better than Seagate's $2.4 billion. Thus, Western Digital has a stronger balance sheet and generates more cash. Also, a lower amount of debt means that it has to bear lower interest expenses, which is why the company can easily hike its dividend. The company currently yields 1.90% with a payout ratio of 25%. Meanwhile, Seagate has a higher dividend yield of 3.30%, but it also has a higher payout ratio of 36%. So, Western Digital looks the more likely of the two to increase the dividend at a faster rate since it is in a better financial position.Enterprise businessWestern Digital is aggressively focusing on tapping the enterprise market. Its enterprise-class solid-state drives, or SSDs, are witnessing strong demand from customers. So, the company is focused on expanding its range of enterprise SSD products -- such as SAS, PCIe, and SATA -- with different form factors and capacities.Western Digital's 6 TB-helium filled drive is being shipped in volumes to several original equipment manufacturers across the globe. On the other hand, Seagate's 6TB enterprise drive was introduced in the last quarter. It's expected to gain momentum in the second half of the year, when enterprise cloud customers adopt higher-density drives. However, Seagate has fallen behind Western Digital in this market, as the latter is already seeing strong shipments of its own 6TB drive. Moreover, earlier this year Seagate announced that it would buy data-storage company Xyratex for $374 million to boost its enterprise data storage systems business. Also, Seagate has just announced the acquisition of the flash components division of LSI from Avago Technologies for $450 million, to tap the growing flash-storage market. Western Digital made such moves last year when it acquired Virident Systems and sTec, for a total of $1 billion, to bolster its enterprise division and flash storage hardware business. The Virident acquisition should help Western Digital tap the PCIe market -- which is growing at an annual rate of 31% and is expected to be worth $2.4 billion by 2016. In addition, the sTec acquisition has brought more than 100 SSD patents to Western Digital, according to AnandTech. As such, it seems that Western Digital has maintained the lead in enterprise storage and is a key reason why it could outperform Seagate going forward.The bottom lineWestern Digital looks like a better bet than Seagate for a number of reasons. It is financially more sound, it gained market share, and has made an early move into enterprise, all of which sets it apart from Seagate.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Google and Amazon Launch Cloud SSDs: Trouble Ahead for Western Digital and Seagate Technology?,"Jul 8, 2014 at 10:15AM","Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) launched SSDs and cross-region load balancing on its Google Cloud Platform in mid-June this year. Google Cloud users with applications that require higher performance will now be able to tap the new SSD persistent disks at a cost of just $0.325 a month/GB. Each unit storage will support up to 30 IOPS per unit of storage, or input/output operations per second. Using 1TB of data would offer 30,000 IOPS and cost $325.Never one to be outdone by a rival, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) quickly followed up by launching its own general purpose SSD-backed volume storage for AWS barely a day later, in a style that was reminiscent of the cloud pricing wars we witnessed early this year. The Amazon SSD is capable of bursting up to 3,000 IOPS per volume, and is ideal for use by small to medium-sized databases in test and development environments, as well as boot volumes. Users will only pay for the storage they provision, with prices starting as low as $0.10/GB.What does this new development mean for the leading storage products manufacturers Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX)?Low enterprise cloud uptake limits the damageWestern Digital and Seagate Technology concentrate on selling storage products such as HDDs and SSDs to enterprises. Western Digital accounts for almost 50% of global laptop HDDs shipped and about 16% of global notebook SSD shipments. Meanwhile, Seagate Technology accounts for about 37% of global laptop HDD shipments.The two companies also sell enterprise cloud storage products, however, mainly to data centers and large businesses. These are high-performance enterprise disks with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies such as network assisted storage (NAS), WD XE, and WD RE that are used for mission critical and near-line applications. Western Digital expects to ship 33 million enterprise and cloud storage units in fiscal 2014 at an ASP of $163 and a gross margin of 36%. Seagate Technology, on the other hand, expects to ship 35 million enterprise cloud units at an ASP of $146 and a gross margin of 27%.The SSD market is still quite small, and HGST estimates that 5.8 million SSD units worth $3.8 billion will be shipped in fiscal 2014. However, SSDs are increasingly becoming popular in the enterprise sector, and HGST estimates the SSD market will grow at a CAGR of 21% to reach $6.7 billion by 2017. A cloud storage service that offers SSD-backed storage could be an attractive proposition for many organizations.At the moment, however, there is little danger posed to Western Digital and Seagate Technology by AWS and Google Cloud. The bulk of companies still rely on internal storage to store their mountains of data. A Gartner study done in 2013 revealed that just 2% of organizations had shifted their core ERP systems to a public cloud.SOURCE: GARTNER, JANUARY 2014With large public clouds offering SSD-backed storage at very affordable prices, there is a possibility that more organizations, especially smaller ones, might find their storage services a good bargain and decide to shift their workloads to these clouds. Since Western Digital and Seagate mainly sell their cloud storage products to organizations, a big shift to public clouds could mean less business for them.This is not likely to be big problem, however. The AWS and Google Cloud SSD-backed storage seems tailor-made for small and medium-sized businesses, while Western Digital and Seagate mainly sell their cloud storage products to large organizations. Additionally, more companies are opting for hybrid clouds instead of using public clouds exclusively. Hybrid clouds encompass a private and public cloud strategy, where some workloads are shifted to the public clouds while more sensitive data is retained in private clouds. A 2013 survey done by 452 Research found that 68% of organizations plan to deploy a hybrid cloud in the next two years.This obviously means that these companies will still need to build their own private clouds and will continue purchasing cloud storage products from the likes of Western Digital and Seagate.What it means for AWS and Google CloudFor AWS and Google Cloud, SSD-backed storage could be a decent revenue stream. AWS is the largest public cloud, and brought in an annual revenue of around $4 billion in 2013. Google does not break down its cloud revenue.Using the number of Google Cloud users (120 million by the end of 2013) and taking Microsoft's recent revelation that 25% of OneDrive users were paying customers and applying it to Google Drive, we arrive at an estimate of $2 billion revenue in fiscal 2014. Paying users with larger chunks of stored data are perhaps more likely to use SSD-backed storage, which would mean a new sizable revenue stream for the public clouds.AWS, however, bears an edge over Google Cloud because of its Direct Connect hybrid strategy whereas Google Cloud lacks a hybrid strategy. Windows Azure employs a vendor-agnostic strategy that allows other vendors to connect seamlessly to it. That could be the main reason why it's the fastest-growing of all public clouds.ConclusionWestern Digital and Seagate Technology are not likely to be materially affected by the SSD-backed storage of AWS and Google Cloud. These cloud services are designed with smaller users in mind, while Western Digital and Seagate mainly sell their cloud-based storage products to large organizations.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons Western Digital Corp's Stock Could Fall,"Sep 30, 2014 at 10:00AM","Investors have seen many investments soar over the years, only to come crashing down as unpleasant business realities overwhelmed positive sentiment. Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) hasn't been such an investment, as its soaring share price of late has reflected strengthening fundamentals in the two-horse race to hard-disk drive (HDD) dominance:WDC Total Return Price data by YChartsWe recently examined three reasons why this strong performance might continue, but informed investors would be well-served to examine both sides of the coin. No business is impregnable, and Western Digital faces several major challenges that might leave investors holding a loss over the coming months or years. Do these threats loom larger than its opportunities? Let's take a closer look to find out.The hard disk drive market has flatlined in recent yearsWestern Digital and rival Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) have both put together strong performances over the past few years, but their financial gains have masked one important fact -- HDD shipments have been slowly dropping for years:Find more statistics at StatistaBetween them, Western Digital and Seagate now sell more than eight out of every ten HDDs shipped worldwide, but both have slid from a post-recession sales peak in 2012. Western Digital shipped 11% fewer units in its latest quarter than it did during the same quarter in 2012, and Seagate shipped 20% fewer units in its latest quarter (both companies reported fourth-quarter earnings for the June quarter) than it did during the same quarter in 2012.It's important to keep in mind that the fourth quarter of 2012 was a historically high-volume quarter for the industry, but even so, unit shipments have not yet progressed from that point. We looked at Western Digital's market share gains as a factor in its favor in our last analysis, but the company's unit shipments have been effectively flat for years even as it has grabbed share from Seagate:PeriodSeagate Unit Shipments Western Digital Unit Shipments Q4 201265.9 million71 millionQ1 201358 million62.5 millionQ2 201358.2 million59.2 millionQ3 201355.7 million60.2 millionQ4 201353.9 million59.9 millionQ1 201455.7 million62.6 millionQ2 201456.6 million63 millionQ3 201455.2 million60.4 millionQ4 201452.5 million63.1 millionSOURCES: SEAGATE AND WESTERN DIGITAL SEC FILINGS.Western Digital may be able to improve its financial performance by boosting margins or streamlining its manufacturing, but if it fails to boost its unit sales going forward, its long-term prospects won't be particularly bright -- especially since HDDs have been losing ground to other storage formats in recent years. That brings us to our second risk ...Western Digital has no real foothold in SSDs or in NAND flashThere's more than one way to store a file. Western Digital is the leading provider of HDDs, but it barely registers when it comes to more portable options -- it has no position in NAND flash memory, which is typically found in smartphones and tablets, and its enterprise solid-state drive (SSD) segment made up a mere 3% of revenue in its latest quarter.Despite several SSD-centric acquisitions in the last couple of years, Western Digital's revenues from this product line are insignificant compared to the estimated $19.4 billion in revenue the entire SSD industry will generate this year. This is quite a bit lower than the $28.9 billion in revenue Western Digital and Seagate combined to earn in their latest fiscal years, but keep in mind that the SSD market's total revenue was only $9.2 billion in 2012. One segment is booming and the other has flatlined, and Western Digital is leading the flat segment.Western Digital's lack of NAND flash manufacturing capacity is also likely to crimp its progress, as NAND is used to manufacture SSDs. Vertical integration is evidently helping the big players in NAND succeed in SSDs as well -- Samsung is the largest supplier of both products, with SanDisk and Micron also among the largest suppliers by revenue of both NAND and SSDs. HDDs aren't going away just yet -- not so long as many large tech companies continue building out massive cloud storage divisions -- but their importance is diminishing in a world of more mobile, more portable storage options.Western Digital's valuation is near its highest level in many yearsSome of Western Digital's growth in recent years is certainly due to a rebound from insanely low valuations -- both its P/E and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios were among the absolute lowest of any billion-dollar company not two years ago:WDC P/E Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsSince the start of 2013, Western Digital's P/E has risen from just 5.2 to 14.6, and its price-to-free-cash-flow has rebounded from 3.6 to reach 10.8. Both improvements represent valuation expansion of almost 200%, and since Western Digital's EPS and free cash flow have both declined since the start of 2013, this means that its share price has grown entirely on the back of strong investor sentiment:WDC EPS Diluted (TTM) data by YChartsHDD manufacturers have long suffered from low valuations (Seagate's P/E was microscopic for years), but the thing about valuations is that they tend to revert over time, especially if the company's underlying fundamentals don't show the strong growth that can justify higher-than-average ratios. An economic downturn could easily send Western Digital's valuations back to low single-digit territory, and when (not if) that happens, its shares are likely to fall quite a bit if the bottom line doesn't soon show marked improvement.Three good reasons?Business history is littered with the corpses of companies that dominated their industries until a better technology came along. No one now expects hard disk drives to fade into obscurity, but few people expected mainframe computers to be completely eclipsed in 1977 (when the first PCs arrived) either. Investors who've thrilled to huge returns from Western Digital's stock should be aware of the risks it also faces -- but it's up to you to decide whether or not these risks are grave enough to sell off your position today.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is This Quiet Street in Ireland Costing Americans Millions of Dollars in Lost Taxes?,"Aug 10, 2014 at 12:40PM","FITZWILLIAM PLACE IN DUBLIN IS HOME TO MANY BUSINESSES AVOIDING U.S. TAX RATES. IMAGE SOURCE: GOOGLE STREET VIEWThe quiet Dublin street seen here is actually a bustling avenue of American business. At least 10 U.S. corporations have incorporated themselves in Dublin with official addresses on or very near Fitzwilliam Place. I'm talking about drug manufacturers, insurance companies, and even tech giants basing their tax bills on Irish law while running their businesses from American soil. By doing so, they're giving their tax bills a massive haircut and boosting their bottom-line profits by millions of dollars every quarter.The strategy is known as a tax inversion, and it's a hot topic right now. If you're looking for an indication of just how inflamed the discussion is, both Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert have made fun of the strategy recently. That's a big stage for a pretty obscure business strategy.The tax-efficient strategy involves an American company buying a smaller business headquartered somewhere like Ireland or the Netherlands, where corporate tax rates are lower. The smaller and more tax-efficient subsidiary then takes official control of the larger business, moving the nexus for tax calculations abroad. At least six such deals currently are under way -- and I'm just counting companies large enough to rank on the S&P 500 index.How big a difference can these tax moves make to a company's bottom line? Let's look at some historical examples.EATON'S DUBLIN HEADQUARTERS SIT INSIDE THE RATHER ANONYMOUS FITZWILLIAM HALL BUSINESS CENTER. IMAGE SOURCE: GOOGLE STREET VIEW.One of the most recent tax inversion transactions occurred in 2012, when industrial titan Eaton (NYSE:ETN) moved its taxable base of operations from Beachwood, Ohio, to Dublin, Ireland.Eaton bought its Dublin-based rival in electrical supplies, Cooper Industries, for $11.5 billion in cash and shares. Technically, the buyout created a new holding company with headquarters in Dublin. The stock still trades on the New York Stock Exchange, and all official filings are stamped with the Dublin address. This new entity immediately shouldered official control of the entire businesses of Eaton and Cooper, but the operational headquarters never left Ohio. Even the former Cooper operations have contact addresses and phone numbers in Ohio and Texas -- not Dublin.So Eaton most definitely pulled a tax inversion. Did it make a difference? I'd say so.In 2011, which was Eaton's last full fiscal year before closing the Cooper deal, the company set aside $201 million for income taxes on pre-tax income of $1.55 billion. That works out to an effective tax rate of 12.9%. It's a far cry from the official 35% American corporate tax rate, thanks to a bevy of deductions and tax credits.But moving to Ireland kept the tax man even further away. In 2013, Eaton only earmarked $11 million for tax payments on $1.88 billion in pre-tax earnings. The effective tax rate: 0.6%.Bottom-line earnings arguably gained from the newfound tax efficiency -- something like $230 million.There's no question that Eaton's new tax strategy is paying dividends. Earnings skyrocketed while tax rates plunged.ETN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.One could also look at an industry with only two serious competitors, in which one took the lower tax rates abroad and the other stayed incorporated in America.I'm thinking about computer hard drives. After a bevy of buyouts, the names to consider in this space are Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX).Both companies have their operational headquarters in California. Seagate hangs out in Cupertino, at the heart of Silicon Valley. Western Digital's officers prefer the even sunnier skies in Irvine, on the south side of Los Angeles.Like many American corporations, Western Digital is officially incorporated in the business-friendly district we know as Delaware. The company claims 78% of its sales outside American borders, putting much of its income in tax-friendlier markets. Like all tech companies, Western Digital also enjoys an even larger number of innovation-based tax credits than Eaton ever did. Its effective tax rate was a measly 7.7% in the 2014 fiscal year, reported last week.That's hardly an oppressive tax burden. But Seagate can still one-up its biggest rival.WELCOME TO SEAGATE'S DUBLIN HEADQUARTERS, JUST DOWN THE STREET FROM EATON'S TAXABLE CENTER. SOURCE: GOOGLE STREET VIEW.The Cupertino-based company has bounced around various tax-efficient incorporation sites over the last decade, with a long stint in the zero-tax Cayman Islands. But regulations changed in the Caribbean paradise, and Seagate found a new reportable home in -- yup -- Dublin, Ireland. Seagate's Dublin address is a comfy five-minute walk away from Eaton's taxable center.In the just-reported 2014 fiscal year, Seagate rode its Irish connection to a net tax credit of $14 million on $1.56 billion in global sales. That's the net result of Ireland's low 12.5% corporate tax rate, along with Seagate's arsenal of tax credits and deductions.Seagate's negative effective tax rate is not a fluke, but rather a sustainable trend. Try as it might, Western Digital can match its rival's tax efficiency only in extreme cases, such as when Seagate took a one-time tax hit in 2011 for its move across the Atlantic.STX EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.That's why Chiquita Brands International (NYSE:CQB) wants to move to Ireland. The fruits and vegetables distributor currently labors under a 41% effective tax rate, so it could use the Emerald Isle's lower base tax.Walgreen (NASDAQ:WBA) is heading to Switzerland for much the same reason. The Swiss corporate tax rate has fallen from 21.3% to 17.9% over the last eight years, while the convenience retailer sends 37% of its pre-tax earnings to Uncle Sam these days.Then again, 100% of Walgreen's sales come from its all-American store chain. The company holds a 45% interest in a much smaller U.K. and Latin American drugstore chain called Alliance Boots, but the income from that foreign adventure amounts to a rounding error on the income statement.Buying out the rest of Alliance Boots would place as much as 25% of Walgreen's sales outside American borders, opening the door to a much bigger global market. And Alliance Boots just happens to have its headquarters in Bern, Switzerland. Completing this partial buyout could be the ticket to much smaller tax bills.The Foolish (tax) takeawayTax inversion moves can put a big dent in corporate tax bills, providing a large boost to after-tax earnings. If Western Digital could reduce its income tax to zero, it would have added $0.11 per share to its fourth-quarter earnings -- a quick 9% improvement.Are these businesses simply fulfilling their duty to shareholders, or are they stealing tax dollars from the American government? That's an ethical quandary for you to ponder. For some, the tax-reduction strategy makes Seagate a better investment than Western Digital. For others, Eaton and Walgreen become ""sin stocks,"" balancing the bottom-line benefits against patriotic scruples.But there is no question whatsoever that tax inversions can boost bottom-line earnings. Even Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart would agree, while gleefully ripping into the moral structure behind the strategy.10 stocks we like better than EatonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

How Seagate Technology Is Morphing Into a Company for the Future,"Jul 2, 2014 at 10:00AM","Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is one of the world's leading enterprise storage products manufacturer. The company accounts for 37% of all laptop hard disk drives, or HDDs, sold around the world, and is on target to sell about 70 million desktop HDDs in fiscal 2014. Seagate also manufactures enterprise cloud storage products, as well as TV, DVR, and console storage products. Close peer Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) accounts for almost half of global laptop HDD shipments.The decline in global PC sales, as well as the growing preference for solid-state drives, or SDDs, and hybrid drives, to traditional HDDs has been taking a heavy toll on Seagate's topline growth. The company managed to ship only 7.7 million its enterprise storage units in the third quarter of 2014, a modest 2.5% year-over-year growth compared to 7% growth for the comparable quarter in 2013. To cope with these industry headwinds, Seagate has adopted several strategies that range from making strategic acquisitions that strengthen its promising businesses, to changing its product mix to reflect industry trends.Strategic acquisitionsSeagate acquired Xyratex, a leading provider of data storage technology and testing equipment maker, for $374 million in 2013 to enhance its enterprise storage offerings. Seagate now operates Xyratex as a stand-alone unit.Xyratex owns several key businesses. The company is a premier provider of HDD testing equipment. The average capacity per drive is growing rapidly, and HDD test time is also rising. Seagate will use Xyratex's HDD testing equipment to streamline its own HDD supply chain.Prominent hard disk manufacturers such as Toshiba and Western Digital use Xyratex's HDD testing equipment. Xyratex has about 3 million test slots installed worldwide using its legacy Drive Processing Systems that enhance factory yields.Xyratex has two other main businesses, ClusterStor HPC storage hardware business and OneStor, which is an enterprise data storage business that manufactures embedded storage and other storage application products. Xyratex's ClusterStor and OneStor businesses make it the largest OEM storage disk manufacturer that serves heavyweight clients such as HP and NetApp.The Xyratex acquisition will give Seagate pricing power over other HDD manufacturers. It will also help the company reduce HDD manufacturing costs and maintain competitive HDD pricing. This is important in the current environment of falling HDD prices. The average HDD unit selling price fell from $63 in 2013 to $61 currently.Xyratex's contribution is likely to become accretive starting from the current quarter, by adding about $100 million to its top line.Seagate acquired Avago Technology's LSI flash business for $450 million in cash in May.The flash business is important for Seagate because of the increasing popularity of SSDs; SSDs use flash components. The LSI flash business will help Seagate on two fronts. First off, sourcing flash components is likely to become considerably cheaper for Seagate, which will help the company offer more competitive SSD prices. Second, it will help the company integrate a leading technology in its SSD products, which will give it leverage when negotiating SSD prices with customers in the future.Although the LSI acquisition will add a mere $40 to $50 million per quarter to Seagate's top line starting from fiscal 2015, small acquisitions can sometimes bring a lot more to a company's table than just top-line growth. Think of Cisco's Insieme ac for $863 a million in 2013, or VMware's acquisition of Nicira for $1.26 billion in 2012. These acquisitions were relatively small compared to the size of the companies that bought them. Yet, the two acquisitions have given both Cisco and VMware a sizable lead over their competitors in the SDN, or software-defined networking, market, which is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 80% to reach $35 billion by 2018. Cisco's and VMware's SDN strategies are currently regarded as the ones most likely to gain traction in the market.Seagate is using a similar strategy to hedge its SSD bets, by making small but highly strategic acquisitions. SSDs are not likely to fully replace HDDs any time soon because of their high cost. SSDs are, on average, 7-8 times more expensive per unit storage than HDDs.SOURCE: ZETTA.But, with chip companies such as Intel releasing CPUs with more cores and more cache each year, traditional disk technology has been lagging behind CPU technology, which has resulted in a significant performance gap. However, this shortfall represents a huge growth opportunity for SSD that can help to fill disk I/O performance and latency.HGST, a Western Digital Company, predicts the enterprise SSD market will grow from 5.8 million units shipped in 2014 worth $3.8 billion, to 13.1 million units shipped in 2017 worth $6.7 billion, equivalent to CAGR of 21%. That implies the ASP of SSDs might fall 22% over the next three years, making them even more affordable.ConclusionThe disk storage market is gradually moving toward higher-performance solid-state disks. Although there is no clear consensus on when SSDs will become mainstream, Seagate is making the right moves that will help it dominate this important market once it reaches maturity.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons Why Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Is Still Worth Buying,"Jun 4, 2014 at 11:00AM","Marvell Technology's (NASDAQ:MRVL) superb run shouldn't stop any time soon. The chipmaker has gained more than 120% in the last year and a half due to solid demand for its chips that are used in storage devices and smartphones. Going forward, Marvell should continue enjoying tailwinds from the roll out of LTE in China by China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) and rapid growth in data storage.Let's take a look at the three key reasons why yinvestors should hold onto this outperforming tech stock.LTE in China is big businessSince last year, LTE deployment in China has been moving at a solid pace, and Marvell seems to be making the most of it. In the first quarter, Marvell's mobile and wireless business grew 30% sequentially, driven by LTE ramps in China. The company saw a number of tier-one OEMs launch LTE smartphones based on its solutions as shipments exceeded expectations. In addition, Marvell claims that nearly half of the best-selling LTE phones in China are based on its platform. The company is slated to gain more traction in this market by powering multimode LTE devices from leading OEMs. The market for LTE handsets in China is huge. China Mobile is aggressively rolling out its TD-LTE network as it plans to build 500,000 base stations by the end of 2014. This is way above its earlier expectation of building 200,000 base stations this year. Also, China Mobile is spending significantly on smartphone subsidies in order to push the adoption of LTE handsets.In fact, China Mobile expects to sell as many as 100 million LTE handsets this year. This number is expected to reach 300 million in 2017, according to research firm iSuppli. Hence, rapid growth is expected in the Chinese LTE handset market, which should continue driving Marvell's mobile business.Storage prospectsMarvell counts the two biggest players in the storage market as clients -- Seagate and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). In fiscal 2014, these two customers together accounted for 36% of Marvell's overall revenue. The company is seeing an improvement in the storage business despite a slowdown in the PC market, primarily due to next-generation hard-disk drive technologies and solid-state drives.Moreover, the enterprise storage space presents a big opportunity for Marvell to sustain its growth in storage. The company is gaining content at Western Digital, its top North America-based HDD customer, and this looks like a significant catalyst.According to Jim Mueller of The Motley Fool, data storage is expected to grow to 6,000 exabytes in 2020 from just under 1,000 exabytes in 2014. This growth will be primarily driven by enterprise systems that Western Digital is trying to tap through product development moves and acquisitions. The company acquired Virident Systems and sTec last year to strengthen its enterprise portfolio. Moreover, Western Digital is also seeing opportunity in hybrid drives. According to Gartner, hybrid HDD shipments are projected to rise to 126.9 million units by 2018 from just 3.4 million units in 2013. Thus, Marvell seems to be in a solid position to benefit from the storage market as a result of its relationship with Western Digital.Attractive fundamentalsDespite recording solid gains in the last 18 months, Marvell's valuation is still quite attractive. The stock trades at 22 times last year's earnings, and the multiple comes down to just 13 on a forward P/E basis. This is value territory for a company that recorded 20% year-over-year growth in revenue and a 94% jump in earnings in the previous quarter. Also, Marvell doesn't carry any debt and it has a strong cash position over $2 billion. Finally, Marvell pays out a dividend of 1.50% at a payout ratio of just 34%. As the company's revenue and earnings are growing at a rapid pace, I won't be surprised if it hikes the dividend going forward.Final wordsAll in all, Marvell ticks all the right boxes from an investor's point of view. It is growing at a fast rate, has a strong balance sheet, and the prospects in its end-markets are bright. All this makes Marvell a company worth looking into."
3 Reasons Why Seagate Technology Is a Top Dividend Stock,"Sep 29, 2014 at 5:11PM","SOURCE: SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY.When most dividend investors think about where to find promising stocks, the technology sector isn't the first place most of them look. Yet despite a reputation for stinginess in the dividend department during the 1990s and 2000s, tech stocks have recently made a big splash with payout increases, and hard-disk drive specialist Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) has demonstrated its commitment to rewarding shareholders over the past 10 years with rising dividends, albeit with some hiccups along the way.Seagate is best known for its position aside peer Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) as the biggest players in the hard-disk drive market. Yet as the PC has given way to mobile devices that use storage devices based on other technologies, Seagate hasn't let the pace of innovation leave it behind. Let's look at three reasons Seagate has the potential to be a top dividend stock for years to come.1. Seagate has an impressive dividend history but has periodically gone through challengesSeagate has followed the same general pattern that tech investors have seen more broadly in the past decade, as maturing companies realize that returning capital to shareholders through dividends has broad appeal. From modest beginnings in 2003 with a roughly 1% yield, Seagate steadily boosted its payout over the years, paying quadruple that initial amount by 2008.STX DIVIDEND DATA BY YCHARTSYet one thing dividend investors never like to see is for a company to suspend its payouts, and that's exactly what Seagate did from early 2009 through 2011. The financial crisis forced Seagate to stop paying dividends for the two-year period to preserve cash, with anticipated savings of $60 million making a meaningful difference to the drive maker's cash flow. Yet in 2011, Seagate returned to dividend-paying status with a vengeance, making up for lost time with a payout half again as large as its pre-suspension amount and then more than doubling that amount in less than three years. At current levels, Seagate's yield is 2.9%, almost twice what Western Digital pays.2. Seagate's traditional hard-disk drive business has found new lifeSOURCE: SEAGATE.For years, many industry analysts looked at the trend toward falling PC sales and declared that companies that relied on PC technology were doomed to obsolescence. In the long run, that might be true, but other PC-reliant companies have recently reported a renaissance in desktop-computer demand. That bodes well for ongoing demand for Seagate's historically strong hard-disk segment.In addition to overall PC demand, Seagate has found ways to market its hard drives for other applications. In particular, the push toward data analytics has led to a huge increase in the need for storage capacity among large enterprises, and finding the right mix between cost-effectiveness and easy access has given new life to the traditional hard-disk drive space. Even as technology presses forward, Seagate should see a constant stream of cash from its less exciting storage products, and that should provide valuable cash flow to finance dividends well into the future.3. Seagate has evolved toward newer storage technologySOURCE: SEAGATE.Seagate isn't just banking on the hard disk drive to provide its future revenue. Recent acquisition moves have bolstered its position in the enterprise storage segment, with Seagate's purchase of the LSI flash business of Avago Technology earlier this year helping the drive-maker build up its presence in the solid-state drive arena. With a cheaper source of flash components, Seagate should be better able to compete in solid-state drive production, which most analysts expect to soar in the coming years. Western Digital believes that the enterprise solid-state market will more than double in shipment volume between now and 2017, and although cost reductions will make revenue grow at a slightly slower pace, there's clearly plenty of growth prospects in newer storage technologies.Seagate Technology isn't necessarily the first place investors would look for a top dividend stock. But with an attractive combination of strength from its existing core hard-disk drive business and growth potential in newer technologies, Seagate is worth a closer look for those seeking both current income and possible higher stock prices in the future.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is The Huge McGraw Hill Financial Data Center Deal Just the Tip of the Iceberg for QTS Realty Trust?,"Jul 9, 2014 at 6:00AM","Just after the closing bell on July 2, 2014 QTS Realty Trust (NYSE:QTS) released a stunning two-part announcement regarding a strategic partnership with Atos SE, an international IT services company, as part of a blockbuster data center deal with McGraw Hill Financial, (NYSE:SPGI). Quite frankly, both parts of this announcement are huge deals.Most investors are more familiar with $22.8 billion cap McGraw Hill iconic brands such as:Standard & Poor's Rating ServicesS&P Capital IQS&P Dow Jones IndicesJ.D. PowerMcGraw Hill ConstructionData has been the heart and soul of this information and analytics powerhouse dating back as far as 1888. Selecting QTS Realty as the company to own and operate such a mission critical facility certainly will send a shockwave throughout the entire data center REIT sector.Why do companies outsource?Large enterprises are faced with the challenging task of deciding how to securely store and ultimately use this data as a profit center to grow earnings. Data center REITs provide outsourcing solutions for areas that are not part of their customer core competencies such as: security, compliance issues, climate control, connectivity, resilience, and how to best provide reliable yet cost effective power. Green power may be an important consideration as well.All data centers are capital intensive to build and own. Is that capital that would be better served deployed in core business initiatives? Probably.A relationship with a large data center REIT aids in planning for disaster recovery and quicker deployment of new initiatives. The list is almost endless, and I have yet to use the word ""cloud,"" or ""hybrid"" even one time!A rising tide lifts all boatsCyrusOne CEO Gary Wojtaszek recently shared that approximately 90% of all the data in the world has been created in just the past two years. This is not a trend which is expected to change anytime soon, in fact it is likely to accelerate.The first half of 2014 has been particularly successful for shareholders of both industry giant $7.9 billion Digital Reality Trust (NYSE:DLR) and its much smaller rival QTS, which currently sports a market cap of just $837 million. At first I was a bit stunned that Digital Realty didn't snag this deal. Digital has an extensive global footprint similar to both Atos and McGraw Hill.Large campuses in the U.S.Sometimes size can be deceptive. A cornerstone of the QTS business plan is based upon acquiring large infrastructure rich facilities at a low initial cost basis.The acquisition and lease-back of an existing 560,000 square foot facility, containing 58,000 SF of raised floor with 12 megawatts of power fits this mold perfectly. Plus, this facility comes with a blue chip anchor tenant.This 194 acre New Jersey trophy property is currently under-utilized by McGraw Hill, as there is the ability to add another 100,000 SF of raised floor and 20 megawatts of power.Scale check: a one-story 560,000 SF building has a footprint of ~12.5 acres under roof!Green with envy, or envy the green?There is nothing small about this data center campus, even its green energy component. In fact, that aspect is absolutely gigantic. There is a 50 acre, 14.1 megawatt solar field adjacent to this facility. It is one of the largest privately owned solar facilities in the western hemisphere.Again, to help put that into perspective, the sun is providing enough electricity to easily power well over 14,000 homes in the region.The Atos partnership may be the real long-term win for QTSConcurrently with the purchase of this East Windsor campus, QTS entered into 10-year lease, and 15-year option with international technology services giant Atos. This arrangement also serves as the foundation for a strategic partnership between QTS and Atos North America moving forward. That could prove to be a real game changer, as well as a platform for QTS to expand internationally.QTS will own large scale enterprise data centers, providing Atos with its custom data center, or C1, offering as well as Critical Facilities Management, or CFM services. In turn, Atos will package the QTS offerings with its own comprehensive suite of IT services solutions, targeting blue chip enterprise customers.Atos has global client base, served by 76,000 employees in 52 countries.Investor takeawayIt looks like QTS has morphed rather quickly from the gutsy little company IPO in Oct. 2013 to the 800lb gorilla I had envisioned back in March, 2014.Income investors may prefer Digital Realty's proven dividend history, and current 5.7% yield. Digital Realty currently provides investors with a way to profit from international data growth. On the other hand, many investors may be more attracted to small-cap QTS' long-term growth potential -- plus a dividend currently yielding 4%. That happens to be my pick moving forward."
Where Will Netflix Be In 5 Years?,"Nov 2, 2014 at 9:00AM","IMAGE SOURCE: NETFLIX.Five years can be an eternity when you're looking at a company in the midst of a sea change. And that's exactly the place where we find Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) right now.As Netflix attempts to expand to all corners of the globe, with the expensive original content production thrown in for good measure, the growth plan can work out in many ways. Good or bad, there are huge changes afoot to raise both risks and potential rewards to sky-high levels. Which way will the winds blow? We asked three Motley Fool contributing analysts to weigh in on how Netflix might navigate the challenges and opportunities of the next five years:Demitrios Kalogeropoulos: With its global expansion done and the U.S. market at steady subscriber levels, Netflix should look like a mature business in five years. Whether that domestic user base settles at Reed Hastings' 60 million-90 million member goal remains to be seen. But we do know this about its market position: Regardless of size, Netflix will likely keep acting like a small upstart on the hunt for new ways to disrupt the entertainment business.Consider just the recent past. It wasn't long ago that the idea of releasing (all at once!) a never-before-aired series sounded crazy. After all, how could you build interest in an unproven show without the traditional episodic broadcasts? Netflix took that gamble with House of Cards and carried it through with more popular hits such as Orange is the New Black. Now it's standard operating procedure for the streaming giant.Since then, the disrupting has only sped up. Netflix has a talk show in the works for 2016, testing the idea that time-sensitive content can't work in an on-demand platform. It will also be streaming the big-budget film Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: The Green Legend on the same day that the movie hits IMAX theaters next year. Maybe film release windows are more flexible than we thought. And Netflix is trying out an episodic approach to movies, with four feature films starring Adam Sandler headed directly and exclusively to its streaming service.Netflix could have responded to its huge growth over the last few years by getting more conservative and fitting more comfortably into the entertainment industry. But we haven't seen that happen. If anything, Hastings' appetite for boat-rocking moves has only grown, which should make for plenty of drama in the years ahead.IMAGE SOURCE: NETFLIX.Anders Bylund: From where I sit, I see a better than 50% chance that Netflix will become more profitable than Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) by the end of 2019.At that point, Netflix streaming services will most likely be sold on every continent except Antarctica. The Americas and Europe will have nearly universal coverage. Key Asian markets like South Korea and Japan will be joined by experimental incursions into India and China. Netflix will be big Down Under. In the Middle East and Africa, the company will have to pick its battles very carefully, but it's going to happen.Opening up new markets is an expensive project, and that effort will still be in play five years from now. But Western Europe will be profitable, margins in North America will rival or even beat arch rival HBO's 35%, and at this point, Netflix has become a well-known center of premium original content.Running low on additional expansion markets, the strategy shift from growth to profit-taking will have begun. More than 700 million households on this lonely planet will be viewing TV-style video content over Internet connections -- and Netflix will be an obvious option for most of these potential customers.When this happens, Netflix could become more profitable than Disney. In 2019 or 2020, Netflix could garner operating profits in the neighborhood of $20 billion. Today, Disney's pre-tax income stops at $12.3 billion.It won't take a massive P/E ratio to justify a $100 billion market cap by then. After all, Disney is worth $152 billion right now.Netflix could beat these estimates, driven by higher adoption rates and faster global broadband growth. The company could also fall short in several ways. But overall, this looks like a reasonable five-year destination.And I'm perfectly happy holding on to my Netflix stock while this global growth story plays out.Andres Cardenal: Growth rates will probably slow down in the U.S. over the coming years, as Netflix is moving beyond its initial growth stage and maturing over time. The good news is that profitability will most likely be considerably higher in the U.S. five years down the road.Contribution margin in the U.S. came in at 28.6% during the last quarter, considerably higher than the 23.7% contribution margin the company produced in the same period during 2013. Management estimates that it will reach a contribution margin of 30% in the U.S. in the first or second quarter of 2015, and it intends to increase margins by 200 basis points per year after that.International markets will probably be a major growth driver for Netflix in the years ahead. International streaming revenues grew 89% during the third quarter, reaching $346 million during the period. This represents approximately 23% of total streaming revenues, and this percentage will probably expand materially over the coming five years.Netflix will also continue leveraging its enormous amounts of data regarding the viewing habits of its members, to purchase and produce valuable content. This will consolidate Netflix's competitive position in streaming via high-quality differentiated content.Competitors such as Amazon.com and HBO will continue building their libraries too, but the online streaming industry will probably offer enough room for many different players to profit and thrive at the same time. Customers often subscribe to multiple services in traditional TV, and there is no reason to believe streaming will be much different as consumers cut the chord and ditch cable."
Why These 4 New Dunkin' Donuts Could be a Game Changer,"Jun 24, 2014 at 6:10PM","LOOKS QUITE INVITING, RIGHT?  SOURCE:  WIKIMEDIA COMMONSFor a company with nearly 11,000 restaurants in 33 countries, the announcement of just four new Dunkin' Donuts (NASDAQ:DNKN) in California would seem barely worthy of a footnote. However, that announcement may actually be one of the most important yet.The Golden State newsOn June 10, Dunkin' Donuts made it official. The company has been teasing for several quarters now with plans to expand into California and throughout the West where it scarcely has a presence. Now, the locations of the first four were revealed with plans in place for another 54 more and agreements in place for a total of 200.Currently, California is the largest market of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) with over 2,000 locations who has enjoyed having barely any direct competition. It's obvious that Dunkin' Donuts, which actually sells more coffee than food, would love to get a piece of Starbucks' coffee pie out there, but the donuts themselves may do well too.Californians loves doughnuts. Krispy Kreme Doughnuts says that its California stores are showing some of the best growth across its chain. There are also smaller chains seemingly on every corner such as Yum-Yum Donuts and Winchell's Donut House.NOT SO INVITING. SOURCE: WIKIMEDIA COMMONSNext time you're in California, give them a try. They may remind you of your grammar school cafeteria quality. If Californians like the doughnuts currently available in the state, they are literally in for a real treat when Dunkin' Donuts lands. Despite the  low quality of the smaller chains, people love them.In the announcement, Dunkin' Donuts stated that it expects to start construction in late June, months ahead of schedule. The reason for the time pressure, according to Dunkin' Donuts President Paul Twohig, is due to the ""strong interest of prospective franchises and consumer across the state."" Sounds promising.What's perhaps more important is twofoldFirst, it's not about the revenue or profits from these four restaurants or even the next 54 restaurants. It's about a model, a test, a pilot in the eyes of the investing community about the potential profitability of Dunkin' Donuts expansion on the Left Coast.The preliminary results could very well telegraph the next large wave of openings. If it's successful, it may lead to acceleration of the rollout just like these first four. Currently according to the release the company believes the state can eventually have as many 1,000 locations. If the tests go as well as the company hopes, however, you have to think that the number could be greatly lifted above 1,000 locations.The company may be sandbagging this somewhat low target of 1,000 locations.  In many areas where Starbucks is located throughout the country, there are around two Dunkin' Donuts for every one Starbucks within the same market. During a presentation in October of last year, Paul Carbone, CFO of Starbucks, mentioned a survey that found 21% of consumers in Los Angeles said they get their morning coffee from Dunkin' Donuts.  The brand is so immensely popular already there that consumers are buying it by the truckload at grocery stores.  Carbone added, ""We sell the most coffee poundage in California.""  2,000 Starbucks in California means potentially let's say room for 4,000 Dunkin Donuts in that single state alone, in a best-case scenario if the company is truly sandbagging.   While it will likely take many years to build out, that also means many years of expanding top and bottom lines. Again, this assumes the initial stores are as successful as many hope.Remember that Dunkin' Donuts is almost entirely a franchise model and only uses franchisees for its expansion going forward.  This means each $1 increase to the top line, all things being equal, is roughly a $0.77 increase in gross profit. There will be then be some overhead expansion as the company grows in order to cover things such as quality control monitoring of its franchisees.  At the risk of oversimplifying the unknown, let's assume what I think is conservative is that increased same store sales growth (and its franchisee royalties) and its associated gross profit covers increased overhead.Over time, earnings and cash flow become one in the same since the business model of a franchisee-based company is rather simple.  It owns few to no liquid tangible assets and income streams other than cash owed to it and cash coming in both from franchisees which makes the accounting earnings and cash flows rather similar.Dunkin' Donuts currently has 11,000 worldwide locations with a target of another 7,500 domestically.  In 2013 Dunkin' Brands Group earned $362 million in royalties alone just for its Dunkin' Donuts segment.In again an effort to remain conservative, let's ignore other forms of income including for example initial franchise fees for each new store and just assume those are at break-even levels.  $362 million is $33,000 per location. Dunkin' Donuts plans to double its domestic store count including those 1,000 California locations.  If we use 6,000 California locations instead as explained above, that means another 12,500 total locations domestically.  $33,000 times 12,500 is  $412.5 million.Using say 100 million diluted shares outstanding (after stock buybacks) and a 33% tax rates based on history, this adds $2.76 earnings per share.  Considering Dunkin' Brands Group the company only earned an adjusted $1.53 last year, that's a significant jump to $4.29 per share using conservative numbers and assumptions but an optimistically executed roll out.Based on the current share price, that puts the P/E at less than 10 which seems like a fantastic opportunity for any solidly earning and growing company is a healthy industry such that Dunkin' Brands is in.  True, it's many years into the future and you'd need to include a rate of discount to account for the time value of money, but it's hard to pinpoint how far into the future this will be.  Dare I say the growth in international and Baskin-Robbins makes up for that?  While I hate to make assumptions, as with any company, there will be all sorts of unknowns and opportunities that neither you nor I can account for at this time.  The second thing...Aside from the company's stock itself possibly starting to price in (AKA move higher) on investor confidence of Western expansion,  the expansion itself would help Dunkin' Donuts diversify its operations geographically. The currently very high Northeast concentration puts its results at higher risk.NOT VERY APPETIZING LOOKING EITHER. SOURCE: WIKIMEDIA COMMONSDunkin' Donuts, or at least its investors, learned this the hard way this past winter. Same-store sales for the overall company were barely in the black. The company's executives blamed the weather for interrupting the ritualistic nature of its core customers who stop by Dunkin' Donuts on the way to work or school.Those who got snowed in at home stayed home, and didn't buy double the donuts and coffee the next day. Those lost sales for the snowed-in days were lost forever. The more regions Dunkin' Donuts can spread out to the better, so that when geographic-specific disruptions due to natural or other disasters happen it won't have as devastating an effect. Case in point, Starbucks was able to brush off the snow and report its 17th quarter in a row of same-store sales greater than 5%.Foolish takeawayLook for comments and details on how these first four California locations are doing, as these may give you a tiny but good enough sample on what to look forward to in the years ahead. Just be careful to take with a small grain of salt the initial honeymoon period that most restaurants experience in the first three months of opening. Regardless, it will be interesting to see how these four do and what kind of disruptions it causes to the local doughnut chains and even the local Starbucks locations.10 stocks we like better than StarbucksWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company's Stock Could Fall,"Sep 2, 2014 at 10:00AM","Goodyear Tire & Rubber (NASDAQ:GT) sells tires across the globe for cars, trucks, buses, aircraft, earth movers, farm equipment, and more, along with providing bulk chemicals and natural rubbers. Yet, despite quietly enabling the world's economy to move (literally), the company is only valued at $6.9 billion and has only outperformed the S&P 500 by 17% in the last decade when dividends are included.GT TOTAL RETURN PRICE DATA BY YCHARTS.Perhaps that's an unfair comparison, since the tire powerhouse only began paying dividends four quarters ago. While that could be taken as a sign of increasing business efficiency and newfound growth, it's also a testament to the challenging markets the company faces. There are good reasons for the company's stock to rise, but here are three reasons Goodyear Tire & Rubber's share price could fall in the coming months and quarters.1. Dissolution of global allianceBreaking up is never easy, but it has the potential to be painfully expensive for Goodyear. The company owns 75% of two companies (Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe and Goodyear Dunlop Tires North America) as part of a global alliance with Sumitomo Rubber Industries, or SRI, which owns the remaining 25% of each. The pair own several other businesses together, with SRI always the minority partner. Unfortunately, the majority owner learned that SRI has engaged in ""anticompetitive conduct"" that warrants the dissolution of the partnership, and is in arbitration to wind it down.That's not necessarily bad news. After all, Goodyear is going through a decent amount of trouble to do ""the right thing"" and protect its reputation. However, SRI has the right to force Goodyear to buy out its stake in all of the businesses that are part of the partnership, which is the only realistic outcome. While this is a value-driving move in the long run, especially with increasing cash flow, a higher than anticipated price tag could be a major headache for shareholders and have a major one-time impact on profits. Investors will have to wait to see if damages and other financial relief sought in arbitration will be enough to cover Goodyear's acquisition costs.2. Europe's economic weaknessNearly every Goodyear region improved its operating margin by at least 41% from 2011 to 2013. The outlier was Europe (also grouped with the Middle East and Africa), which saw operating margin plummet 42% from 7.8% in 2011 to 4.5% in 2013. In the same period, total tires, err, tyres, sold decreased from 74.3 million to 60.8 million, or enough to equip 3.38 million vehicles. And, no, Europe didn't incinerate millions of vehicles.WHAT HAPPENS TO THE AUTOBAHN IF EUROPE STOPS REPLACING ITS CAR TIRES? SOURCE: DARKONE/ WIKIMEDIA COMMONS.Instead, weak economic growth and high unemployment have forced Goodyear Tire & Rubber to swallow lackluster performance in the region. In an attempt to combat the obstacles facing its business, the company closed the manufacturing facility in Amiens, France, in the first quarter of 2014 and will exit the farm tire business in the region. The moves are expected to improve operating income by $75 million per year , which would strengthen the region's operating margin by 25% over 2013. While this is a smart move given current conditions, Europe remains a challenging market for tire manufacturers and will continue to weigh on the business.3. Substantial debt What makes having to buy out a conniving partner even worse? Not having the financial flexibility to assure shareholders that it won't be a major issue. Goodyear had $15.2 billion in total liabilities and just under $17 billion in total assets at the end of the second quarter. That high amount of debt could limit the company's ability to target growth moving forward and will limit its flexibility in reacting to significant market obstacles, such as the dismal performance in Europe.A total debt-to-assets ratio of 89.7% could also put Goodyear Tire & Rubber at a competitive disadvantage to its peers and competitors, which could be better positioned to target growth opportunities and expand manufacturing capacity in new regions. That's especially true of manufacturers with ample government support, such as those in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific.Foolish takeawayNo company faces an unimpeded path to growth or expansion, but there are several good reasons that Goodyear Tire & Rubber's stock could fall. If it weren't for the poor performance in Europe and the looming dissolution with SRI, investors might be taking a much more optimistic view of the tire manufacturer's future. Can you overlook those risks to tap into an improving business? 10 stocks we like better than Goodyear Tire & RubberWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company's Stock Could Rise,"Aug 27, 2014 at 1:00PM","WHAT CAN RISE FASTER, THE COMPANY'S BLIMP OR ITS STOCK? SOURCE: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS.When you think of tires, you probably think of the ones on your car and leave it at that. But The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) wants you to know that its opportunities extend far beyond that. The company sells tires for replacement and original equipment across the globe for automobiles, trucks, buses, aircraft, earth movers, farm equipment, and more in addition to selling chemicals and natural rubbers. Growth has been challenging in years past, but here are three reasons The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company's stock could rise in the coming months and quarters.1. Growth in Asia, Latin AmericaTapping into emerging markets comes with unique risks and opportunities, but the general strategy seems to be working for tire manufacturers. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company has performed exceptionally well in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. Consider the performance of tire sales for each region, which has led to increasing operating profits (discussed below):  20132012% of Total Units (2013, 2012)Latin America17.9 million tires18.1 million tires11%, 11%Asia Pacific21.9 million tires20.6 million tires13.4%, 12.6%SOURCE: SEC FILINGS.While growth in Latin America would appear to be slowing at first glance, investors should know two things. First, most vehicle tires in the region are manufactured in the region, while imports only have a fraction of the market share. That means The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company will have to invest in its manufacturing presence in the region before it sees significant growth, considering it's currently generating 11% of total tire units sold from just 9.5% of its manufacturing floor space.Second, the company sells 69% of its tires through independent dealers. That doesn't necessarily help the company's products stand out, but new labeling requirements will. Brazil will require tire certification and labeling for rolling resistance, wet grip, and noise for all passenger car, light truck, and commercial truck tires sold in the country by 2016, while labels begin rolling out for new tires sold in the second quarter of 2015. Labeling all tires will make it easier for consumers to make side-by-side comparisons, which will make the superior quality and offerings of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company's products stand out, especially when it comes to rolling resistance.Meanwhile, the Asia Pacific region is quickly becoming the best-performing region for the company. Region sales accounted for 13.4% of total units sold, despite accounting for just 11.5% of total manufacturing floor space. As we'll see below, Asia Pacific also boasted the highest operating margin.2. Fuel efficiency maniaDrivers in developed nations such as the United States are driving fewer and fewer miles every year, but they're more focused on fuel efficiency than ever before. While the trend in miles driven isn't necessarily great news for The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, the attention being paid to fuel efficiency is fantastic news. The company has enjoyed early success with its Assurance Fuel Max tires, which have much lower rolling resistance coefficients than previous generation tires.SOURCE: THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY.What the heck is rolling resistance? It's the tendency of your tires to deform when you accelerate, increasing friction and lowering fuel economy in the process. The new tire formulations can boost fuel economy by 4% over their 65,000-mile lifetime, which saves up to 2,600 miles' worth of fuel. You can bet that will be a key marketing angle featured on the new labeling requirements in Brazil.3. Improving operating marginPerhaps the best reason for The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company's stock to rise is an improving operating margin. Consider the operating margin performance broken down by region in each of the last three years.  201320122011North America8%5.3%2.8%Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA)4.5%3.7%7.8%Latin America13.7%10.7%9.3%Asia Pacific13.8%11%9.8%Total8.1%5.9%6%Total Operating Profits$1.58 billion$1.25 billion$1.37 billionSOURCE: SEC FILINGS.Overall, things should only continue to improve for the company with great performance in key growth regions (Latin America, Asia Pacific) and more efficient operations in core regions (North America). The closing of a large manufacturing plant in France this year is expected to boost EMEA operating margin by 25% on an annual basis compared to 2013, but Europe continues to be a thorn in Wall Street's side. Foolish bottom lineWhile it's easy to overlook a tire manufacturer as an investment opportunity, especially given the relatively pedestrian growth and total sales figures, there are several good reasons The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company's stock could rise in the coming months or years. An increased presence in fast-growing regions such as Latin America and Asia Pacific will help make up for lackluster performance in Europe, while premium products focused on customer demands will boost margins in North America. Of course, there are also several good reasons the company could face continued headwinds, which we'll discuss in an upcoming article."
3 Huge Risks Facing Electronic Arts,"Jun 17, 2014 at 1:00PM","SOURCE: EA.COMElectronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) most recent fiscal report saw the company beat projections and double earnings per share from the previous year. The company has enjoyed a strong debut on new platforms from Sony and Microsoft, evidenced by its titles accounting for 40% of Western game sales on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in the last fiscal quarter. Even more promising, EA has been leading the games publishing market in terms of diversification.45% of the company's revenue in the last fiscal year came from high-margin digital transactions, with guidance suggesting that number will climb above 50% in the current year. EA has also been in discussions with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) to stream games directly to cable boxes. Yet, even with the promising aspects of the company's business firmly in mind, the gaming industry is still volatile. Amidst a transformative period in video games, these three risks threaten EA's long-term outlook.EA has content problemsOf the large gaming publishers, EA has perhaps the worst reputation in terms of quality control and product innovation. The company has frequently been accused of shipping substandard, bug-ridden games and failing to offer substantial content improvement between franchise installments. While much of this criticism is generated by a vocal minority, there are clear instances where EA has botched high-profile releases.SOURCE: EA.COMThe quality and handling of EA's 2013 release Battlefield 4 prompted consumer outrage and multiple lawsuits, with one case charging that EA intentionally misled investors about the state of the game. There exists concern over whether Battlefield 4 has harmed the broader series and if it will negatively impact this year's Battlefield: Hardline. As one of the companies biggest 2014 releases, a soft performance for Hardline would be a big misfire.The company has also received substantial criticism for the quality, content, revenue models of recent games such as SimCity, Dragon Age II, Mass Effect 3, Plants vs. Zombies 2, and NBA LIVE 14. The broader properties attached to these games are of considerable importance to EA, but, in many cases, the company has done a less than optimal job delivering on quality and content.EA may be overly dependent on licensesAs one of the largest publishers in gaming, EA has substantial funds with which to acquire lucrative licenses. The company recently secured exclusive rights for the incredibly popular ""FIFA"" games until 2022. It has also sured up ""Star Wars"" until 2023, despite the fact that its last Star Wars game was a big underperformer.EA also has access to the NFL, NHL, NBA, UFC, and The Simpsons licenses. All of these properties are undeniably strong, but the extent to which EA's performance relies on them creates a plethora of additional variables and risk.Rumors and evasive comments from EA representatives suggest that EA may no longer have exclusive access to the NFL license, and that Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) could attempt to position a competitor. The smaller publisher has already beaten EA on the basketball front, with its NBA 2K14 substantially outperforming EA's NBA LIVE 14 both critically and commercially. Take-Two's basketball game has even outperformed the latest Madden on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but the company's relatively small cash reserves mean that the NFL license would be a sizable investment. Still, there are other big companies in the gaming industry that could ready a Madden competitor if the license is on the table. With the possibility of increased competition, EA's quality control issues are compounded.The Internet is uncertainThe possibility of EA teaming up with Comcast to provide streamed content is rife with possibilities, but it could also go terribly wrong. The most recent console hardware cycle has already seen EA back out of a partnership with Nintendo and rework its content strategy after first offering support for the original Xbox One product vision. EA's goal is to shape the progression of online gaming and content distribution, but doing so is a bit of a tightrope act.SOURCE: EASPORTS.COMComcast has already stated that it plans to begin charging consumers based on bandwidth, and the telecom giant's ongoing power struggles with online content providers like Netflix and Google are well-documented. Electronic Arts will eventually face similar pressures if it wants to provide its customers with expedient access to its content and services. Members of EA's digital ecosystem will also likely be paying more money for Internet access and other online content, which has the potential to shrink the available spend pool.Foolish takeaway...While there are notable risks facing the company, EA remains an attractive investment option. Large third-party publishers are well-equipped to handle the gaming industry's changing landscape, and EA's diversification efforts are particularly commendable. While shares of fellow publishing giant Activision Blizzard currently hover around an all-time high, Electronic Arts still trades below pre-Financial Crisis prices, a point that suggests the company's valuation will continue to rally. Elements of risk are present, but EA still looks to be one of the best bets in gaming. "
Were The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Earnings Really Worth a 25% Pop?,"Nov 20, 2014 at 4:08PM","Lately, cars, planes, and heavy machinery aren't the only things rolling on tires manufactured by Goodyear Tire & Rubber (NASDAQ:GT). The company's stock has rolled higher by 25% since the announcement of third-quarter earnings at the end of October -- a spike justified by record operating income for any quarter in the company's 116-year history and the highest segment operating margin in more than 10 years (the company uses segment operating margin to describe profits from the sale of tire products). Now that investors have had nearly two weeks to digest that abrupt rebound from the stock's 60-week low, is there anything to suggest the great quarter wasn't worth such a sudden turnaround in share price?By the numbers  Q3 2014Q3 2013% ChangeUnits Sold41.9 million42.6 million(1.7%)Total Revenue$4,657 million$5,002 million(6.9%)Gross Profit$1,141 million$1,056 million8%Gross Margin24.5%21.1%16.1%Diluted EPS$0.58$0.62(6.5%)Shareholders' Equity$2,103 million$1,868 million12.5%*THE COMPANY'S 3Q14 ADJUSTED EPS ARE $0.87. SOURCE: EARNINGS PRESS RELEASE.Goodyear had a great quarter, although given the dismal situation surrounding Goodyear's pension obligations and inefficient operations that weighed on shares since the turn of the century, investors are more focused on how quickly new management can climb back to a healthy balance sheet and strong cash flow. So far, so good, but what were the driving forces? And how well is management executing its game plan to return value to shareholders in the coming years?Driving forcesFor a company as globally distributed as Goodyear Tire & Rubber, investors should zoom in to each reporting region to get a sense of progress and performance. For instance, North America and Europe easily represent more tire sales than Latin America and Asia, but growth in the latter markets represents an intriguing opportunity for investors and operating margins. As we'll see below, operating efficiency is the driving force behind the company's upward trajectory.Consider the number of units sold per geographic area in the first nine months of this year and how it compares to the same period in 2013.  Nine Months, 2014Nine Months, 2013% ChangeNorth America45.1 million45.4 million(0.7%)EMEA47.7 million46.4 million2.8%Latin America12.7 million13.5 million(6%)Asia-Pacific17.0 million16.3 million4.3%SOURCE: EARNINGS PRESS RELEASE.As you can see, while North America and Europe account for the bulk of the company's unit sales, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific offer great growth avenues, although the competition is greater. Now consider each region's segment operating margin for the first nine months of this year and how it compares to the same period in 2013.

And don't be discouraged by falling margins in Goodyear's growth markets. The Asia-Pacific is still churning out healthy profits in spite of lower selling prices. Meanwhile, Latin America unit sales are suffering this year due to uncertainties in Venezuela, while operating margin is down mostly due to expansion in Brazil (an investment in the long term). Zooming outPremium products have also provided a boost for the company. When when it comes to tires, it's more complicated than just using better materials. Premium tires are manufactured quite differently than lower-value tires -- something Goodyear can exploit with its unique capabilities and expertise and use as leverage against competitors.GT DATA BY YCHARTS.Additionally, the company is taking advantage of the momentum to repurchase up to $150 million of shares in the fourth quarter alone. That represents one-third of the total shares in the current three-year repurchasing program ending in 2016. All else being equal, fewer shares mean higher earnings per share and stock price, but I would rather see capital deployed in high-value investments.What does it mean for investors?Goodyear Tire & Rubber's third-quarter earnings demonstrated how a large, distributed, and knowledgeable company can leverage its expertise to exploit current market conditions and compete with smaller, sometimes state-owned manufacturers rather than be too big to respond. Investors were pleased that management updated its full-year earnings guidance to weigh in at the high end of the previously reported range of 10% to 15%. That not only shows that the company is executing on its growth plans, but that the previously reported goal of growing earnings by at least 10% through 2016 might not be as unattainable as once thought by Wall Street.In other words, the company's more than 25% gain since October lows was certainly justified by recent performance and the optimism for continued momentum.

Is Now the Time to Buy MetLife Inc Stock?,"Oct 10, 2014 at 10:37AM","The financial sector, which includes both property and casualty as well as life insurance businesses, had a hard time coming out of the financial crisis. This becomes clear when realizing that large-cap insurance companies continue to trade at meaningful discounts to book value -- six years after the financial crisis struck.Share prices of major insurance companies like MetLife (NYSE:MET), Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU), and American International Group (NYSE:AIG) have largely disappointed investors yet again in 2014 with marginal gains year to date: Of the three insurance companies, only American International Group's shares returned 4%, whereas shares of MetLife lost 1% and shares of Prudential Financial 6%.Focus on AsiaU.S. insurance companies did have to fight an uphill battle after the financial crisis hit in 2007-08, and the cards in the industry were reshuffled thanks to American International Group's troubles in its Financial Products division that threatened to bring down the entire U.S. financial system.The ill-advised speculation on credit default swaps in AIG's Financial Products division ultimately led to the bailout of AIG and, as a result, precipitated the divestment of AIG's stake in Asian insurance company AIA in 2012.The Asian market is highly attractive for U.S. insurance companies because of its potential for incremental earnings growth. It is easy to see that Asian markets are still mostly underserved in terms of insurance policies (P&C, Life, Health etc.) given that its population is generally much younger compared to Western countries, and that Asian insurance markets are still developing.According to a 2014 study from accounting firm Ernst and Young, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to do extraordinarily well over the next couple of years, with the ""region's share of the global middle class to nearly double, rising from 28% in 2009 to 54% in 2020."" This will have positive implications for the insurance industry.As such, insurance companies with exposure to the Asian growth story make a strong selling point. Contrary to AIG, which sold its stake in AIA in order to pay back the government for its bailout, MetLife still benefits from strong operating earnings growth in this promising geography.SOURCE: METLIFE INVESTOR PRESENTATION.In 2013, Asia contributed almost 20% of MetLife's total operating earnings, and further increases, underlining Asia's importance for MetLife's incremental earnings growth, are likely going forward. From 2011 to 2013, operating earnings growth in Asia has outperformed non-Asia operating earnings growth by 4 percentage points in reported and 10 percentage points in constant currency terms.While investors certainly need to account for the impact of currency volatility, the benefits of being present in an appealing growth market with high demand for middle-class insurance solutions are clearly outweighing concerns about fluctuating exchange rates.Digital life insurerTo support policy distribution and to further its goal of becoming Asia's leading digital life insurer, MetLife has pushed its digital presence in order to capitalize on e-commerce opportunities. Its award-winning mobile platform offers MetLife access to consumers, streamlines sales and claims processes, and supports stronger customer relationships -- which in turn could lead to market share gains and higher earnings as a result. SOURCE: METLIFE INVESTOR PRESENTATIONValuationFrom a valuation perspective, insurance companies are still extraordinarily cheap -- and this is particularly true for companies like MetLife that have exposure to attractive growth opportunities in nonsaturated geographies like Asia.All large-cap insurance companies, AIG, MetLife, and Prudential Financial, trade at discounts to their respective book values -- to varying degrees. AIG currently still faces the largest book value discount of a whopping 30%, whereas MetLife and Prudential trade at only 14% and 3% discount from their book values, respectively.While MetLife's 14% discount to book value is appealing considering that it is an insurance company with growing earnings, it becomes even more appealing when realizing at what valuation multiples MetLife traded at before the financial crisis.Metlife has historically traded at much higher valuation multiples than the ones at which it trades now. A lot of it has to do with how investors see the earnings prospects of the entire insurance industry and how euphoric investors are in general. As such, it comes as no surprise that MetLife, like other insurance companies, traded at much higher P/B ratios in a period of exuberance preceding the economic collapse in 2006-2007.While a P/B multiple of 1.5 times is at the higher end of MetLife's historical valuation spectrum, it still goes to show that MetLife's equity valuation has much more room to grow in a period of economic expansion.The Foolish bottom lineMetLife is an interesting business for long-term investors who want to bet on increasing insurance company valuations in an environment of stronger economic growth. MetLife's exposure to and reliance on Asia to drive earnings growth as well as its ambition to becoming a digital life insurance leader justify a higher equity valuation for one of the largest insurance companies in the world.10 stocks we like better than Prudential FinancialWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

SanDisk Corporation Will Buy Back $2.5 Billion of Its Own Stock. Hooray?,"Feb 6, 2015 at 8:30AM","Despite the fact that we are now more than 5 years into an aging bull market, companies continue to plow billions into share buyback plans. Why just last month SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) announced plans to repurchase another $2.5 billion worth of its own shares. That's on top of the $500 million or so in buybacks already authorized under its previous repurchase program. But is this a savvy financial move to scoop up cheap shares, or a misguided attempt by management to support the stock price after its post-earnings collapse?SNDK TOTAL RETURN PRICE DATA BY YCHARTSToday, we'll find out, as we ask two basic questions:Can SanDisk pay?Well, not right away, at least. Not all at once. But the almost $2.3 billion in cash that SanDisk currently possesses -- plus its nearly $2.8 billion in long-term investments that can be converted to cash -- give SanDisk ample dry powder to complete its buyback.And even if it weren't enough, S&P Capital IQ data show that last year, SanDisk generated more than $1.46 billion in positive free cash flow from its business. That's enough to pay for the entire buyback in cash, without touching a penny of SanDisk's reserves.Should it pay?Granted, SanDisk also has $1.2 billion in debt on its books. Might it not be prudent for SanDisk to think about paying that down before committing cash to buybacks? Well, it depends. While busy paying down debt, for example, SanDisk's share price might rise -- and management might miss an opportunity to buy it back cheaply. So, let's take a quick look at the stock's valuation relative to its peers -- and see if now is actually a good time to buy the stock ""on the cheap"":  P/EDividend Yield5-Year Projected Growth RateTotal Return RatioSanDisk18.11.6%16.8%1.0Western Digital15.01.6%8.4%1.5Seagate12.93.7%6.2%1.3Micron9.2-15%0.6PEER COMPARISONS COURTESY OF FINVIZ.COMWith its stock trading for more than 18 times earnings, SanDisk seems the priciest stock on the computer memory ""block"" -- at least at first glance. But there are a couple of factors in SanDisk's favor that bear mentioning.First and foremost, according to analysts who follow this industry, SanDisk boasts the fastest growth rate on offer -- a blazing hot 16.8% annualized. Combined with the stock's modest 1.6% dividend yield, this adds up to a ""total return"" ratio of 1.0. Judged by the valuation yardstick of master investor John Neff, who invented the concept, this suggests SanDisk's stock is indeed cheap enough to be worth buying at today's prices.When you consider further that SanDisk generates 44% more free cash flow than it reports as GAAP net income, the stock may be even cheaper than that. Valued on free cash flow, SanDisk shares carry only an 11.4 P/FCF ratio -- which is very cheap given the projected growth rate.Meanwhile, relative to the lower-P/E, but slower-growing competition, only Micron comes close to SanDisk for total return on a shareholder's investment. And unlike SanDisk, Micron is currently generating significantly less free cash flow than it reports as GAAP profits -- suggesting the ""bargain"" price on Micron may be more illusion than reality.What it means to investorsLong story short, I don't see any really good reason for SanDisk not to buy back its shares today. They're cheap by one measure (P/E), and even cheaper by another (P/FCF). Meanwhile, the SanDisk's positively loaded with cash, and looking for a good place to invest it. If you ask me, investing this cash in buying back undervalued SanDisk shares is a smart move."

Despite Goldman's role in the financial crisis, and obnoxious statements such as CEO Lloyd Blankfein's claim that the bank is doing ""God's work,"" its sterling reputation has remained in tact. Goldman's predictions are the closest thing to a crystal ball in the financial media, and they regularly draw headline coverage. However, they are often dead wrong. Here are some of the bank's worst predictions from 2014. 1. Gold will decline significantly Prediction: After a loss of around 26% in 2013, Goldman said the precious metal would continue to lose its luster in 2014, falling by at least 15%, or below $1,057, citing, among other things, the effects of the Fed's stimulus taper. Goldman reiterated the target several times over the course of the year.Reality: Gold hit a bottom at $1,150 last fall, never approaching Goldman's target, and finished the year essentially flat, down just about 3%.Predicting the future value of gold is particularly difficult, as there are no cash flows underlying the value of the metal, nor is it tied to economic growth the way other commodities since it's not valued for its utility.2. Oil will be $90 in the first quarter of 2015Prediction: Goldman had originally forecast West Texas Intermediate crude prices to reach $90 a barrel for the first quarter of 2015, but it made headlines when it cut its price target in late October for the beginning of this year. Reality: It's now three weeks into 2015, and oil remains below $50, befuddling nearly every analyst on Wall Street. To its credit, Goldman was actually more bearish than its peers, lowering its forecast before other banks did. Its predictions also often have the effect of moving the market, so oil prices generally fell as Goldman lowered its forecast. With oil now below $50, the banks have adjusted their forecasts accordingly, but there have been so many revisions at this point that current predictions are just as likely to change next week, making them essentially useless. 3. Brazil will win the world cupPrediction: Goldman Sachs' prediction for the World Cup received a lot of attention,and it came with a detailed explanation on how the model was based on regression analysis using the entire history of international competitive matches since 1960. It also weighed factors such as home-continent advantage for Latin American teams. The model gave Brazil a near 50% chance of winning -- unusually strong, and far better than Argentina, which was next in line with a 14% chance of winning.Reality: Brazil was ousted in the semifinal in embarrassing fashion, losing 7-1 to Germany, which went on to win the tournament, beating Argentina in the final.  Of course, Goldman didn't guarantee Brazil would win the tournament, but they were still four times as likely to win as Germany, which was given an 11% chance of emerging as champion, underscoring the difficulties of predicting sports outcomes and the fact that the model was probably flawed.Lessons for investorsThe financial media is rife with predictions and punditry, as that helps sell investors, but rarely do analysts take the time to look back on the accuracy of their predictions. Moving price targets on items such as oil prices makes doing so even more difficult as each prediction seems to be subject to further review.  This should remind investors that in the financial markets, there are no true ""experts"" who know with certainty what will happen in the future.Another recent headline underscores the rarity of successfully making big calls. Zach Schreiber, CEO of hedge fund PointState Capital, laid out a case for oil's collapse back in May and has reaped a $1 billion profit betting on its fall. Many other hedge funds lost big on the oil plunge, and the big banks, meanwhile, have just been following the news as they lower their oil price projections. In hindsight, of course, it seems easy to have seen the oil crash coming, but most could not and did not predict it. Similarly, the subprime mortgage collapse was also foreseeable, but almost none of the financial experts projected that collapse. Goldman's predictions will continue to be splashed on financial news headlines, but investors should remember: Talk is cheap. 10 stocks we like better than Goldman SachsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"After Plunging, is SanDisk Corp. Stock Worth Buying?","Apr 1, 2015 at 10:04AM","Shares of SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) are now down 34% year to date. The company issued relatively weak guidance for the year during its earnings report in January (significantly missing first-quarter and full-year 2015 estimates), which drove the first leg down.Then, last week, SanDisk pre-announced that Q1 results would be even worse than the weak initial guidance it provided as a result of ""certain product qualification delays, lower than expected sales of enterprise products, and lower pricing in some areas of the business.""More troublingly, this does not appear to be a one-quarter issue, with SanDisk saying in its press release that it expects those complicating factors to impact its financial results for the rest of the year. Not surprisingly, the company said 2015 revenue will be ""lower than previous guidance,"" and it withdrew its prior forecasts for both the quarter and the full year.What are analysts now expecting?The average analyst estimates for SanDisk's full-year revenue and earnings per share now sit at $6.28 billion and $4.49, respectively. That means SanDisk sales are expected to decline by about 5.3% and earnings per share by 20% year over year. Sales are expected to grow by 9.6% in 2016, with earnings per share rebounding to $5.44.At the most recent close of $64.98 per share, SanDisk trades at 14.5 times the current-year earnings estimate and 11.9 times the 2016 estimate. This is hardly an expensive stock, but I believe the two consecutive revenue and profit misses against analyst expectations do not sit too well with investors, leading to a sub-market earnings multiple.Are SanDisk's future prospects still intact?It's worth stepping back to understand exactly what is going on with SanDisk; to do that, we need to rewind to the last quarterly report. At the time, SanDisk issued a fairly disappointing guidance. Management said the loss of a major OEM customer would lead to a weak first half of 2015.Management, however, was optimistic at the time that business would pick up in the second half of 2015, with CFO Judy Bruner saying the company would be in the ""upper half"" of its target financial model during that period (you can see this model in the slide below):SOURCE: SANDISK.However, SanDisk's latest earnings pre-announcement specifically pointed to lower than expected sales of enterprise products as impacting the company for the year.Given that SanDisk had guided to $1 billion in enterprise solutions-related revenue this year, and had pointed to enterprise sales helping product mix (enterprise products carry higher gross profit margins than client products) and offsetting the aforementioned client SSD weakness, it's no wonder investors were unhappy.Is the glass half-full, or half-empty?I agree with the popular view that SanDisk's issues are related to its own execution rather than to the fundamental demand for its products. For example, the ""product qualification delays"" and the ""supply issues"" SanDisk cited in its pre-announcement are issues particular to SanDisk's execution.Execution issues in a healthy market can be a bit of a double-edged sword.On one hand, if SanDisk can work through its issues, then it might be able to capitalize on the attractive opportunities in the markets in which it competes. However, there's uncertainty as to when or even if SanDisk will improve its execution against fierce competitors.I'm waiting for the earnings reportI'm going to wait for SanDisk's full earnings report and accompanying conference call before deciding whether to bet on a turnaround.I'd like to hear management's ""vision"" for putting execution back on track. If the plan sounds attractive, and if the stock stays low, then I might consider opening a position.If the plan appears unworkable, then I'm obviously going to steer clear of the stock.10 stocks we like better than SanDisk CorpWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Best Stocks in Waste Management,"Jun 1, 2015 at 2:18PM","PHOTO: EPSOS.DE, FLICKR.Certainty is nice to have, but it's hard to come by in the stock market. Still, you can always choose to focus on relatively reliable industries and companies. Smartphones, social media, and cloud computing are exciting and have great potential. But it's hard to know what those universes will look like in five or 10 years, and what the best stocks will be.On the other hand, it's fairly certain that we will always have garbage, and that it will always need to be managed. Thus, let's look at some of the best stocks in waste management to add a little certainty to our portfolios. Waste Management (NYSE:WM)Waste Management is a biggie, with a market capitalization of nearly $23 billion and a dividend yield of 3.1%. It's North America's largest waste-management company, providing collection, transfer, recycling, and resource recovery, and disposal services to residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal customers. It's not just an old-fashioned garbage collector, though -- it also owns and operates landfill gas-to-energy facilities.It's hard for such a big company to grow briskly, but Waste Management has been working on keeping costs down, in part by converting its fleet to run on liquefied natural gas, while raising some prices. The company generates more than $1 billion in free cash flow annually, and its net margin was recently near 7%, a respectable number and greater than that of its closest competitor.PHOTO: ATRAMOS, FLICKR.U.S. Ecology Inc. (NASDAQ:ECOL)U.S. Ecology Inc serves the commercial and government worlds, treating, disposing of, and recycling hazardous, non-hazardous, and radioactive waste, among other services. It recently acquired The Environmental Quality Company, greatly expanding its capacity, but also delivering a large debt burden, which the company is working on paying down.One intriguing catalyst for the company is Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA), which is building a ""Gigafactory"" to produce lithium-ion batteries in large quantities. The process will inevitably produce hazardous waste, which U.S. Ecology, via its location some 440 miles away, might be able to handle. The company's dividend recently yielded 1.6%.PHOTO: MR.TINDC, FLICKR.Clean Harbors Inc. (NYSE:CLH)Clean Harbors Inc also serves industry and governments, offering end-to-end hazardous-waste management, emergency spill response, industrial cleaning and maintenance, and recycling services. Having acquired Safety Kleen in 2012, it's now ""North America's largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil and a leading provider of parts washers and environmental services to commercial, industrial, and automotive customers.""The company's first-quarter results were disappointing, in part because falling oil prices slowed down business; but management noted: ""Looking ahead, Clean Harbors is entering its seasonally strongest quarters, and the trends in our core environmental and industrial businesses are promising. We expect a number of our key vertical markets to drive large-volume project activity and additional opportunities.""Waste Connections (NYSE:WCN)Waste Connections is another integrated waste-management company, collecting, disposing, recycling, and composting various waste from residences, businesses, and oilfields. It even offers intermodal services, moving containers of cargo and solid waste. It, too, is turning methane from landfills into electricity. Its recycling efforts are impressive; as the company notes, ""[W]e recycle over 50% of our collected waste volumes on the West Coast, in some cases over 70%.""Revenue, net income, and earnings per share have all been growing by double digits, on average, over the past 10 years. Waste Connections also has some of the highest margins in the industry, with net margins expanding in recent years to approximately 11% today.PHOTO: KEVIN GESSNER, FLICKR.Also interesting ...You might also keep an eye on Covanta Holding Corp. (NYSE:CVA) and Republic Services (NYSE:RSG). Covanta Holding Corp. specializes in turning trash into energy at some 46 plants. Its bottom line has turned red in the past few years while revenue growth has stalled, in part because energy and metals prices have put pressure on its business. That's a temporary problem, though, and Covanta does offer patient believers a 4.7% dividend yield.Republic Services is America's second-largest trash hauler. As Waste Management has also done, it has bought up some oilfield waste operations, which may seem inopportune at the moment, with oil prices sagging and weakening interest in drilling. However, it could pay off over the long haul. Interestingly, Bill Gates' Cascade Investments owns nearly a third of Republic Services. The company is free cash flow-positive and offers a 2.8% dividend yield."
3 Things Western Digital Corp. Management Wants You to Know,"Dec 10, 2015 at 2:30PM","The CEO of hard disk maker Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Steve Milligan, presented at the recent Nasdaq Investor Program in London. During the presentation (which consisted of prepared remarks followed by a question-and-answer session), Milligan offered quite a lot of insight into the company's business today as well as its longer-term prospects.In this article, I'd like to highlight three items from the presentation that stood out to me as I research the company as a potential investment opportunity.Despite storage growth, industry profits are shrinking; what might reverse this?Katy Huberty, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, observed that over the past several quarters, total hard disk drive industry profits have shrunk despite continued growth in total shipped hard disk drive capacity and a very consolidated market (there are only two major players in the hard disk drive market -- Western Digital and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) -- with Toshiba a distant third in terms of market share).Huberty asked Milligan about his views on what will drive a change from the current situation and ultimately allow the hard disk drive industry to perform better.Milligan noted that the PC market has performed worse than the company had expected heading into the year, which affected both total industry profits as well as Western Digital's own profitability (it's worth noting that competitor Seagate has also been affected and its stock price is down slightly more year to date than Western Digital's is).The hard disk drive maker's CEO says the company is optimistic that the decline in the PC market ""might begin to abate a bit,"" which he thinks could ""enable a more stable environment from not only a revenue perspective, but also from a profit perspective.""A Western Digital-specific tailwindIn addition to the hard disk drive industry potentially getting healthier should PCs stabilize, Milligan also highlighted another factor that could significantly improve Western Digital's profitability: a recent ruling from the Ministry of Commerce of the Government of the People's Republic of China, or MOFCOM.By way of background, Western Digital acquired rival hard disk maker Hitachi Global Storage Technologies back in 2012. In order for this deal to pass MOFCOM scrutiny, Western Digital had to agree to essentially run Hitachi Global Storage Solutions as an ""independent competitor in the global hard disk drive market.""In complying with these terms, Western Digital has had to deal with substantial duplication of resources (research and development, sales and marketing, and so on), impacting the company's financial efficiency and ultimately profitability. Recently, however, MOFCOM agreed to allow Western Digital to begin to more tightly integrate the Western Digital and Hitachi Global Storage operations. According to Milligan, the only real ""separation"" that needs to happen now following the latest MOFCOM ruling is that Western Digital and Hitachi Global Storage need to have two separate sales forces.All told, the savings that Western Digital expects to realize, per Milligan, on the operating expense side of things works out to $400 million annually that the company expects ""to fully fall to the bottom line.""Milligan also says there will be savings that manifest themselves in terms of gross profit margin, but the magnitude of the cost reduction has yet to be publicly quantified.""We intend to quantify that sometime in the first part of 2016 as to what those savings will look like,"" Milligan stated.Comments on the SanDisk acquisitionWestern Digital recently announced it would be acquiring flash memory specialist SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) in a bid to bolster its efforts in solid state drives.Milligan said Western Digital had been ""thinking about"" either acquiring or investing in SanDisk for a number of years.""It was not a reaction to any short-term changes in the market that we've been seeing,"" the executive clarified.So, why exactly did the company buy SanDisk? Milligan outlined three big-picture reasons.""It allows us to have the broadest product portfolio in the industry bar none,"" he said. Western Digital is already a leading vendor of hard disk drives, and with SanDisk under the company's belt it will also be a major vendor of flash-based solutions into both consumer markets as well as enterprise applications.Milligan also argued that by owning SanDisk, Western Digital will ""have access"" to flash-based technology (which is known to have a number of significant advantages relative to standard mechanical hard disk drives) both today and going forward.""The reason why having access to that technology is that we will be able to tune those flash-based solutions or hard-drive based solutions in a way that are [sic] most optimized for these changing customer needs,"" he said.Finally, Milligan believes this deal should offer a ""very compelling, long-term financial return"" for both Western Digital and its stockholders."
Better Buy Now: Western Digital Corp. or Seagate Technology PLC?,"Nov 10, 2015 at 11:20AM","Times have been tough for Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), the two largest manufacturers of hard disk drives (HDDs) in the world. Shares of both stocks have fallen around 40% since the beginning of the year.That's because the HDD market is being cannibalized on the consumer end by flash-memory solid state drives (SSDs), which run faster, use less power, don't have damage-prone platters, and fit better in thin notebooks and tablets. Yet times are also tough in the SSD market due to the arrival of 3D NAND technology, which could cause SSD and HDD prices to reach price parity as early as next year.IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.To survive in this rapidly shifting market, Western Digital and Seagate have both tried to diversify beyond HDDs. Let's take a closer look at their strategies, growth potential, and valuations to decide which stock is a better buy today.The data-storage arms raceAt the end of last year, Western Digital controlled 43% of the HDD market, Seagate controlled 41%, while Toshiba accounted for the rest. Between the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2014, global HDD shipments fell 16% from 167.5 million to 141 million, according to Storage Newsletter and Trend Focus. However, that decline was slightly offset by robust demand for cheap storage in cloud data centers.To increase its market share in SSDs, Western Digital bought Hitachi's hard drive business, SSD manufacturer STEC, enterprise flash storage company Virident Systems, storage optimization software developer VeloBit, and flash storage array maker Skyera. In October, it agreed to buy flash storage giant SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) for $19 billion. According to Kitguru's market share numbers, Western Digital now controls nearly 14% of the SSD market, making it the second largest player after Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), which controls 45%.Seagate, which made more acquisitions than Western Digital to expand its HDD portfolio over the years, hasn't made as much progress in SSDs. Its only meaningful defense against Western Digital's shopping spree is a multiyear NAND supply alliance with Micron Technology, which controls about 10% of the SSD market.Western Digital has better growthLast quarter, Seagate's revenue fell 22.5% annually to $2.93 billion and missed estimates by $10 million. Enterprise, desktop, and notebook storage shipments all declined across the board, and margins slid from 28.1% a year ago to 24.2%.Western Digital's revenue fell 14.7% annually to $3.36 billion in its most recent quarter, as gross margin declined from 30.1% to 28.9%. However, two-thirds of Western Digital's revenue came from non-PC markets, up from 55% a year earlier. Western Digital's enterprise SSD revenue climbed nearly 50% annually. Those numbers will likely rise even higher after the SanDisk deal closes. For the current quarter, Seagate expects revenue to fall 19% to 22% annually. Western Digital expects revenue to fall 13% to 15% annually during that period. Based on these numbers, Western Digital looks like a more solid investment than Seagate.But Seagate also has fundamental strengthsYet Seagate still has three distinct strengths -- valuation, buybacks, and dividends. Seagate trades at just 9 times earnings, which is significantly lower than Western Digital's P/E of 12 and the industry average of 20 for the data storage industry.Over the past 12 months, Seagate spent 86% of its free cash flow (FCF) on stock buybacks. Western Digital, which spent 47% of its FCF on buybacks during that period, suspended its buyback program due to its acquisition of SanDisk. While a suspended buyback program isn't a huge deal, it indicates that SanDisk's multiples will slightly decline as it reduces the number of outstanding shares, making Western Digital shares look even pricier.Seagate pays a forward annual dividend yield of 4.2%, compared to Western Digital's yield of 2.4%. Seagate has raised its dividend for four consecutive years, versus just two straight years for Western Digital. Western Digital has stated that it will keep paying its dividend, but future payout increases could be affected by the SanDisk acquisition.The verdictWestern Digital and Seagate both face big near-term challenges, but I believe that the former is better positioned for long-term growth. Its acquisition of SanDisk, while costly, will help it pivot more smoothly into the SSD market, while synergies and expanded manufacturing capabilities will let it produce more storage devices at lower prices. Seagate is a fundamentally cheaper stock with bigger buybacks and dividends, but it will likely struggle to gain ground against Western Digital in both HDDs and SSDs.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Did Western Digital Corp. Overpay for SanDisk Corporation?,"Oct 28, 2015 at 7:37AM","Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) recently agreed to acquire SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) for $19 billion, or $86.50 per share. WD controlled 43% of the market for traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) last year. However, WD only has a small market share in solid-state drives (SSDs), which are smaller, faster, and don't have damage-prone moving parts. Despite their higher cost, SSDs have displaced HDDs in higher-end tablets and PCs over the past few years.IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.That's why WD bought SanDisk, which controls 11% of the SSD market. Combined with Hitachi's hard drive unit, which it acquired three years ago, WD will control nearly 14% of the SSD market. That makes it the second largest SSD manufacturer in the world after Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), which controls nearly 45% of the market. While the logic behind the deal is sound, some WD investors might be wondering if the company overpaid.The key numbersWestern Digital's proposed $86.50 purchase price will consist of $85.10 in cash and the rest in stock. But if a planned 15% investment in WD by Tsinghua Unigroup subsidiary Unisplendour goes through, the cash portion of the deal will drop to $67.50 per share.Western Digital finished last quarter with just $5.3 billion in cash and $2.6 billion in debt. To finance the deal, WD plans to take on $18.4 billion in new debt. It will also suspend its buyback program, which was used to buy back $758 million in shares over the past 12 months. However, WD will keep paying dividends, which took $396 million out of its free cash flow of $1.6 billion over the past 12 months.Western Digital expects cost synergies to reach a $500 million per year run rate within 18 months. The company expects the deal to become earnings accretive within 12 months after closing.Do two losers make a winner?By buying SanDisk's portfolio of NAND chips, controllers, and SSDs, WD has greatly reduced the threat of SSDs disrupting its core HDD business. But SanDisk also struggled over the past year due to lower prices, product delays, and a loss of top customers like Apple and Samsung. Apple previously accounted for nearly a fifth of SanDisk's business, according to Bloomberg estimates.As a result, analysts expect SanDisk's revenue to tumble 17% annually this year, to $5.5 billion, and earnings per share to plunge 43%. By comparison, Western Digital is expected to post a 7.4% decline in sales to $13.5 billion with an earnings drop of 13%.Buying SanDisk gives WD a strong presence in SSDs and flash memory, but it also inherits the company's problems. Samsung could keep stealing business away, while a projected NAND oversupply could keep driving down prices. Earlier this year, SanDisk admitted prices were declining faster than costs, and that it remained behind the technological curve in next-gen 3D NAND technology. While SanDisk's SSD sales rose 60% annually to $1.9 billion last year, or 29% of its revenue, sales of embedded and removable storage both declined.Did Western Digital pay too much?WD's offer of $86.50 per share values SanDisk at nearly 35 times trailing earnings, compared to the industry average P/E of 15 for the data storage industry. Therefore, investors might be wondering why WD didn't wait for SanDisk's price to drop further.There are three explanations for WD's timing. First, it wanted to take on $18.4 billion in debt when interest rates were low. A potential hike later this year could cost WD hundreds of millions in extra interest payments. Second, SanDisk shares have been rebounding since September, thanks to several analyst upgrades that championed SanDisk's growth potential in the enterprise SSD market. Lastly, SanDisk's $1.1 billion acquisition of Fusion-io just started to become earnings accretive. If Western Digital waited longer, it could end up paying higher interest rates on an even higher total price tag.How this fits into everything elseBy merging its manufacturing operations with SanDisk, WD can take advantage of economies of scale and manufacture more SSDs and memory chips at lower prices. This would help it compete more effectively against Samsung. This strategy also complements WD's acquisition of Hitachi GST, which boosted its HDD market share against industry rival Seagate (NASDAQ:STX).It might take a while for Western Digital to fully integrate SanDisk's business, but after that integration concludes, Seagate could be in trouble. Seagate bought Samsung's HDD unit four years ago to counter WD's purchase of HGST, but its only defense against WD's acquisition of SanDisk is a multi-year NAND supply alliance with Micron.The key takeawayWD needed to buy SanDisk to boost its lead over Seagate and improve the balance between SSDs and HDDs in its portfolio. The price tag might seem high, but considering the favorable interest rate environment and SanDisk's potential rebound, I believe Western Digital made the right move.10 stocks we like better than SanDisk CorpWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Western Digital Corp's Top Chinese Investor Is a Growing Tech Beast,"Dec 21, 2015 at 7:14AM","China's Tsinghua Unigroup, the state-controlled company that bought a 15% stake in storage-solutions leader Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) earlier this year, plans to evolve into a chipmaking behemoth during the next few years. Prior to that investment, Unigroup bought Spreadtrum and RDA Microelectronics, two major fabless chipmakers in China, for $2.7 billion.TSINGHUA SCIENCE PARK. SOURCE: PIXABAY.Earlier this year, Unigroup tried to buy U.S. memory-chipmaker Micron for $23 billion, but the deal was blocked by U.S. regulators due to national security concerns. Undeterred, Unigroup recently unveiled plans to buy 25% stakes in three chip test and packaging firms in Taiwan -- ChipMOS Technologies, Silicon Precision Industries, and Powertech Technology -- for $2.6 billion. All three companies welcomed Unigroup's investment, but pro-independence and pro-unification leaders in Taiwan have opposed the deal, citing national security concerns and a potential loss of intellectual property.If those controversial investments are approved, Unigroup could gain ground against its top rivals, American chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek, and South Korean tech giant Samsung. Therefore, tech investors should keep a close eye on Unigroup, and understand how its growth could affect the ability of U.S. chipmakers to compete in China.Why was Tsinghua Unigroup established?Tsinghua Unigroup is 51% owned by Tsinghua Holdings, a conglomerate that is wholly owned by China's elite Tsinghua University. The other 49% is held by Beijing Jiankun Investment Group. Zhao Weiguo, who controls the latter, became the chairman and CEO of Tsinghua Unigroup after the company was privatized in 2010.To strengthen China's domestic chip sector, Unigroup signed major deals with Western chipmakers, tried to consolidate the domestic fabless semiconductor market, and tried to invest in, or acquire, overseas tech companies. In May, Hewlett-Packard agreed to sell a 51% stake in H3C Technologies, its Chinese data networking business, to Unigroup for $2.3 billion. HP also agreed to create a group inside China to house H3C's server, data-storage, and technology-services businesses.The Chinese government hopes that revenues from its domestic chip companies can grow more than 20% annually and become a 350 billion yuan ($54 billion) market by 2020. That growth could help China reduce its dependence on U.S. tech, which the country doesn't like using due to security concerns, while establishing a pillar of growth for its domestic economy.Consolidating the market against QualcommUnigroup has repeatedly declared its intentions to overtake Qualcomm, the largest mobile chipmaker in the world. At the end of 2014, Qualcomm respectively controlled 51% and 64% of the application-processor and wireless-modem markets, according to research firm Strategy Analytics.But by July, Strategy Analytics reported that Qualcomm's share in application processors had slipped to 47%, while MediaTek controlled 15%. In October, the company reported that Qualcomm's share of the wireless modem market had fallen to 60%, compared to 19% for MediaTek, and 6% for Unigroup's Spreadtrum.Investing in, or acquiring, MediaTek could help Unigroup become Qualcomm's biggest competitor. In a recent interview with Taiwan's Commercial Times, Unigroup's Zhao stated that if cross-strait investment rules were relaxed, he planned to meet with MediaTek chairman Tsai Ming-kai to discuss a potential merger between MediaTek, Spreadtrum, and RDA Microelectronics. Such a merger could significantly strengthen MediaTek's position against Qualcomm. MediaTek recently told Taipei Times told the company would adopt an ""open attitude"" toward cooperating with Unigroup.The enemy of my enemy...While regulators in the U.S. and Taiwan have viewed Unigroup's growth with suspicion, the company has welcomed foreign investments. Last September, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) bought 20% stakes in Spreadtrum and RDA through a $1.5 billion investment in Unigroup.Intel invested in those two low-cost chipmakers to gain ground in the mobile market against Qualcomm, which dominates the high-end and mid-range markets with its Snapdragon processors. Intel has gained ground in tablets, but its market share in smartphone application processors and wireless modems remains in the single digits. By teaming up with a state-backed firm and releasing cheap reference designs for low-cost Chinese OEMs, Intel hopes to gain mobile market share in Qualcomm's biggest market.More investments and buyouts aheadQualcomm has recently been struggling all across the world. In China, it was slapped with a $975 million antitrust fine and forced to lower its patent licensing fees for Chinese-made phones. Regulators in South Korea and Taiwan also recently launched similar probes against the company. The European Commission is also investigating allegations that the company used predatory pricing to force rivals out of the market.All this regulatory pressure on Qualcomm is creating an opportunity for Tsinghua Unigroup to catch up. The company has already established footholds in the data-storage, data-center, networking, and low-cost mobile chipmaking markets.

Ditch Solid-State Drives But Stick With Hard-Disk Drives?,"Jun 28, 2015 at 5:50PM","In late 2013, Avago Technologies (NASDAQ:AVGO) announced it planned to acquire LSI Corp. for a whopping $6.6 billion. LSI designed, among other things, controllers for hard-disk drives and solid-state drives (via its acquisition of SandForce).About six months later, though, Avago sold LSI's accelerated solutions and flash components divisions to hard-disk drive giant Seagate (NASDAQ:STX). This, according to AnandTech, meant that Avago jettisoned LSI's flash accelerator business and its solid-state drive controller business.Given that hard-disk drives are generally considered ""older"" technology in the world of storage, and solid-state drives represent the ""new"" and ""exciting"" technology, it might initially seem Avago got it backward.But it didn't. Here's why.The solid-state drive market is fiercely competitive; not so much with hard-disk drivesThe hard-disk drive industry has three major players: Seagate, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and, to a lesser extent, Toshiba. Supplying these three players with controllers for those drives are Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Avago (via its purchase of LSI).The market for hard-disk drives might not be booming -- according to Yahoo! Finance, both Seagate and Western Digital are expected to register modest revenue declines in the coming fiscal year -- but it's large and relatively stable. And, for drive vendors and controller vendors alike, there's not much competition.This is in sharp contrast to the solid-state drive market.In solid-state drives, a number of vendors manufacture NAND flash, including the Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) joint venture, the Toshiba and SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) joint venture, Samsung Electronics, and Hynix.All of these companies develop and market solid-state drives, and they also sell NAND flash to companies that then build their own solid-state drives. Four of the six vendors above (Intel, Samsung, Toshiba, and Hynix) develop their own solid-state drive controllers. Micron and SanDisk generally source controllers from the merchant vendors.This vertical integration isn't the only factor that makes the merchant solid-state drive controller market so tough. Several merchant vendors, including JMicron, Marvell, and Silicon Motion (NASDAQ:SIMO), are all vying for the noncaptive solid-state drive controller business.Finally, speaking of ""captive demand,"" Apple's new MacBook came packed with an Apple-designed flash controller (widely believed to be the product of its 2012 acquisition of Anobit). I suspect Apple's plan is to transition completely to in-house flash controllers, further narrowing the proportion of the market a merchant controller vendor can ultimately target.Avago seemingly made the right choiceI would say Avago ultimately made the right choice to jettison the LSI SandForce business. Competition within the merchant market for flash/solid-state drive controllers is fierce, and the opportunities for merchant controller vendors as a proportion of the total solid-state drive market don't seem to be getting any larger. The hard-disk drive controller business is much more attractive.10 stocks we like better than Broadcom LtdWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here's Why Micron Technology Is Paying $3.5 Billion For a Longtime Partner,"Dec 15, 2015 at 1:30PM","IMAGE SOURCE: INOTERA.On Monday morning, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) announced that it is buying 67% of Taiwanese memory chip producer Inotera Memories in a $3.2 billion deal.The agreement puts a $0.92 price on each Inotera share, traded on the Taiwanese stock exchange. The sale should close in the middle of 2016, assuming that the usual regulatory proceedings work out as planned. Inotera and Micron are still hammering out the final details of the contract, and should have a final version ready in approximately 60 days.Micron is financing the buyout with a combination of existing cash, $2.5 billion of new debt, and $1 billion of Micron shares. Although Inotera is a publicly owned company, sector rival Nanya Technology's parent company owns nearly half of what Micron is buying here. Nanya has agreed to vote in favor of the sale in return for that $1 billion block of Micron shares.What's the big deal?Quite frankly, Micron could live without this buyout. It's a positive move, but investors will actually hardly notice the difference in the long run.Micron already buys and redistributes 100% of Inotera's chip production, which represents roughly 35% of Micron's total manufacturing volume. This deal simply puts a couple of close business partners even closer together. Kind of like a large company that's leasing some of its business assets, and now wants to own them instead.It's not really a game-changing strategy overhaul, but more of an efficiency play. Micron's production workflow will simplify when the Inotera deal closes, as will the company's accounting.Micron has experience with big-ticket buyouts, where failure just wasn't an option. The often uncertain Elpida deal created economies of scale that were absolutely necessary for survival. But that's not what we're looking at here.If Taiwanese regulators or Inotera shareholders trip up this deal, clocks will not stop in Micron's Boise, Ida., headquarters. Getting this done would be a useful administrative move, but the beat goes on anyhow.MICRON'S BOISE HEADQUARTERS. IMAGE SOURCE: MICRON.Throwing wrenches in the works?That being said, having this billion-dollar deal on the stove -- complete with new debt financing -- probably kept Micron from entering a bidding war over SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) this summer. Hard drive veteran Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) ended up paying $19 billion for the flash-memory device specialist, and it is quite possibly that Micron drove the price up.But instead of reaching for a truly massive SanDisk deal, Micron decided to double down on business efficiency and wait for Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) to come looking for a deep and long-term supply contract. It won't be quite the growth play that a straight-up SanDisk buyout could have been, but this option also saves Micron billions of deal dollars while digging a hole in rival Western Digital's pocket. Smart thinking, I say.The storage industry has boiled down to a handful of muscular players, much like the memory sector before it -- and thanks to the rise of solid-state storage, the two industries are inching ever closer together.The Inotera buyout is not even a real factor in these trends. It's just a minor tweak to Micron's operational efficiency.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

The 2 Best Stocks To Invest In Data Storage,"Aug 11, 2015 at 1:00PM","Investing in the data storage market can be tricky, and requires an understanding of the growing rift between platter-based hard drives (HDDs) and new solid state drives (SSDs).SOURCE: PIXABAY.HDDs were once standard in the PC market, but market growth has slowed over the past four years due to the rise of tablets and ultrabooks, which require smaller SSDs for thinner frames. Worldwide HDD shipments fell annually between 2011 and 2013, but recovered 2.2% in 2014, as growth in the cloud/enterprise market offset losses in laptops and tablets.The SSD market is much smaller than the HDD one, but it's growing rapidly. Back in 2012, over 15 times as many HDDs were shipped worldwide as SSDs. Last year, HDD shipments were only about five times higher. SSD makers, looking for growth beyond the slowing tablet market, are now looking toward the enterprise market. However, HDDs still have a price advantage in that market, since they still cost about half the price of an SSD with the same storage capacity.Now that we understand those trends, let's discuss two of the top ""pure play"" stocks in HDDs and SSDs -- Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK).Western DigitalWestern Digital controlled 44% of the HDD market last year, compared to 41% for Seagate and 16% for Toshiba. HDDs generate the majority of Western Digital's revenue. According to research firm Gartner, SSD sales only accounted for $500 million, or 3%, of Western Digital's 2013 sales. Due to ongoing concerns about SSDs displacing traditional HDDs, shares of both WD and Seagate have fallen 26% since the beginning of the year.However, Western Digital has beefed up its SSD portfolio with several acquisitions, including SSD manufacturer sTec, enterprise flash storage company Virident Systems, and storage optimization software developer Velobit. It also acquired flash storage array maker Skyera last December. Thanks to those investments, Western Digital's enterprise SSD (data center) revenues more than doubled annually to $244 million last quarter, indicating that the business could soon generate over $1 billion in annual revenues.Western Digital is still strongly dependent on the PC market, which experienced a 9.5% annual decline in the second quarter, according to Gartner. During Western Digital's fourth quarter earnings (reported at the end of July), revenues fell nearly 13% annually to $3.19 billion, missing the company's own prior guidance for $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Adjusted non-GAAP EPS declined 24% to $1.51, but topped estimates by five cents.Those numbers looked weak, but analysts were optimistic regarding WD's eventual integration of Hitachi's hard drive business. WD purchased the unit two years ago, but the full integration of manufacturing and supply operations has been delayed by MOFCOM (the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China) due to antitrust concerns. Brean Capital analyst Amanda Baruah, who has a $150 target price on the stock, expects an approval to contribute $60 to WD's stock price.SandiskSandisk is the third largest manufacturer of flash memory in the world after Samsung and Toshiba. But unlike those massive companies, Sandisk is a ""pure play"" on the flash storage and SSD market.Sandisk's SSD business is its fastest growing division. The unit's annual revenues soared from $440 million in 2012 to $1.9 billion in 2014. The unit's contribution to Sandisk's top line soared from 3% in 2011 to 29% in 2014. However, that percentage is expected to remain the same this year, due to the loss of a ""major customer"" in the client SSD (notebooks, tablets, smartphones) market in January -- widely believed to be Apple, its top customer.Sandisk also continues to faces intense competition from market giants like Samsung, expanding HDD makers like Western Digital, and flash memory rivals like Micron. All that pressure caused Sandisk to lower its revenue guidance for fiscal 2015, causing its stock to plunge 40% since the beginning of the year.However, Sandisk bounced back slightly in late July after it beat analyst estimates on both revenue and earnings with lower-than-expected declines for its second quarter. Looking ahead, Sandisk expects its acquisition of SSD maker Fusion-io, which closed last June, to strengthen its enterprise SSD portfolio and become earnings accretive this year. That growth could offset its declines in the client SSD market.A contrarian viewThe market clearly doesn't love Western Digital and Sandisk due to ongoing concerns about disruption and competition. However, both companies are rolling with the punches -- WD is expanding its SSD portfolio, and Sandisk is using enterprise SSDs to offset losses in client SSDs.WD is also fairly cheap, at 13 times earnings, compared to the industry average of 19 for data storage devices. Sandisk has a higher P/E of 23, but that's significantly lower than its P/E of 32.5 from early 2013. Both stocks could recover in the future, but investors should do their homework and fully understand the data storage market before buying any shares."
3 Things SanDisk Corporation's Management Wants You to Know,"Nov 18, 2015 at 3:00PM","Public companies almost always follow up on their quarterly reports with some kind of conference call. Most of the time, it's a plain old phone conference with management and analysts. Other times, it's a live video stream with a tightly controlled management interview, or even a no-holds-barred flow of questions from common investors, submitted over social media. Either way, there will almost always be more color in these calls than a regular earnings release can provide.SOURCE: WESTERN DIGITAL.But when SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) recently reported third-quarter earnings, the follow-up was very different. Right alongside the expected report, SanDisk also announced that hard-drive veteran Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is buying the company in a blockbuster $19 billion deal.So there was a change of plans. ""SanDisk will not host a third quarter 2015 earnings conference call, previously scheduled for today,"" said the earnings release. That call was replaced by a merger call -- but don't confuse that for an opportunity to talk about SanDisk's freshest business results.""Please note that today's conference call, including the Q&A portion of the call, will focus exclusively on the transaction announced today,"" said Bob Blair, Western Digital's VP of investor relations. By and large, that order was followed.Accordingly, there will be no discussion of SanDisk's third quarter here. For the record, the Flash-memory expert beat Wall Street's estimates across the board thanks to a highly profitable product mix.But that won't stop SanDisk's management from getting the last word. So let's hear how the two companies are planning their big-ticket merger.1. Data growthBetween 2013 and 2020, we are expecting to see about 10x growth in data. Data is becoming more strategic, both for enterprises and end users. Workloads are increasingly transitioning to Big Data-centric analysis, requiring massive amounts of storage and computing power.The accelerating trend of mobility and consumerization of IT is allowing us to establish direct relationships with data users. Businesses' desire to have more efficient and agile infrastructures is driving architectural transformation in the data center.This transaction allows us to fully participate, influence, and shape each of these trends.-- Steve Milligan, Western Digital CEOThis is why Western Digital and fellow hard-drive specialist Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) will remain valuable for years to come, even without a solid-state strategy in place. Magnetic platters still provide massive economies of scale, and we're a long way away from SSD storage matching the cost per byte of magnetic storage.That being said, Western Digital is smart to pick up an established leader in the SSD space, and I'm curious as to why Seagate isn't following suit. It's true that the Flash-memory space isn't exactly littered with handy buyout candidates anymore, but Seagate could climb down the supply chain to pick up a components specialist or two, then hammer out a solid-state strategy around that acquired expertise.Instead, Western Digital is not only merging with a premium-grade SSD builder, but also outspending Seagate in the research department. And after this buyout closes, the combined SanDisk/WD beast will sport an R&D budget nearly twice the size of Seagate's. With or without the SanDisk deal, the bulk storage market's balance of power is shifting. This deal only accelerates the existing trend.SANDISK CEO SANJAY MEROTHRA. PHOTO: SANDISK.2. Unmatched knowledgeThe storage industry is evolving rapidly, and customers are looking for partners that understand data-center requirements and the technologies shaping them. Innovative partners with deep technological capabilities, scale, and ecosystem relationships are becoming increasingly critical to our customers.Both SanDisk and Western Digital have a shared heritage of innovation, and our combined technical expertise will be unmatched in the industry.-- Sanjay Mehrothra, SanDisk CEOMehrotra really hits the nail right on the head here. If there's a secret sauce in this business combination, it's in the pairing of Western Digital's bulk-storage expertise with SanDisk's consumer and high-performance chops.Seagate certainly can't match this deadly combination, as explained above. And beyond that, there are really only three hard-drive makers left in this ultra-consolidated market. Toshiba offers both SSD and hard-drive products, but holds a vanishingly small market share in both cases, and has bigger fish to fry in the consumer-electronics space.SanDisk plus Western Digital will be a unique business, and we don't even have a historical precedent for this chimera. I can't wait to see the products this company will cook up -- or how Seagate plans to fight back.3. SanDisk's world didn't stop on a dimeWe have said that, in the initial transition to 3D, the capital intensity will go up for SanDisk. But it will remain, we believe, within the target financial model that we've defined for the CapEx, which is 20% to 30% of our revenue.And so we have planned this over time. We will begin ramping our 3D in 2016 in their new Fab 2 that was just announced last night.-- Judy Bruner, SanDisk CFOThe merger talk doesn't stop SanDisk from conducting business as usual in the meantime. Bruner's comment here is a great example of that fact.The company is ramping up a new technology platform for higher-density Flash-memory storage. This is an essential step toward making these solutions more affordable, so SanDisk is putting its back into the effort with a major capital investment.But the factory upgrades won't push SanDisk out of its capital expense comfort zone, and the Western Digital merger will only increase SanDisk's headroom for long-term planning. In fiscal year 2015, SanDisk spent 32% of its operating cash flows on capital expenditures; Western Digital's ratio was just 27%, and started from a much larger operating cash-flow funnel.It's business as usual for SanDisk -- until it isn't. And I would say that the company is looking forward to an upgraded financial platform."
Seagate Technology Down 30% Year-to-Date -- What Should Investors Think?,"Jul 23, 2015 at 1:40PM","SEAGATE 1-YEAR STOCK CHART, DATA BY YCHARTS.It's been a rough year for Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), to say the least. Shares of the hard-drive maker are down approximately 30% year to date, due to rising fears that the deterioration in the PC industry this year will spread to manufacturers of PC accessories, such as the hard drives that Seagate produces. Seagate essentially confirmed these fears when it reduced its financial targets for the current quarter.But while things look bad, the stock could be an opportunity for investors who aren't afraid of taking a contrarian view. Shares of Seagate have been beaten down so badly this year that they're now cheap. Here are the key factors weighing on Seagate in 2015, and why the stock may be worth holding anyway.The bad newsUnfortunately, there's a lot of bad news out there. Signs are popping up all over the place that the PC market is in really bad shape.Technology research firms IDC and Gartner both found that PC shipments are down significantly this year. Gartner's research indicated that global PC shipments fell 9% year over year in the second quarter.IDC's findings were even more troublesome -- it estimated that worldwide PC shipments declined 11% in the same period. These are striking numbers that would represent the steepest quarterly decline in the past two years.One of the reasons for sluggish PC demand could be the upcoming release of Windows 10. In addition, PCs face tough comparisons this year, as PC shipments last year benefited from a large refresh cycle, particularly in the enterprise market. Third, PCs are struggling because a greater share of computing is being performed on mobile devices like smartphones.This hurts Seagate because of the rippling effect to PC-related accessories, such as data-storage devices. Because of this, earlier this month Seagate cut its forecast for revenue and gross margin for its recently-ended fourth fiscal quarter.The company now expects $2.9 billion in revenue for the quarter, a steep reduction from its prior forecast, which called for $3.2 billion-$3.3 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin will likely clock in at 27%, about 1.5 percentage points lower than previous expectations.Management attributed this to lower-than-expected demand, without offering much in the way of specifics. Fortunately, there is an investment case to be made for Seagate if the difficult operating climate improves going forward.The good newsAt the very least, Seagate's huge stock price drop this year has left the stock cheap, which could lure investors attracted by the low valuation and high dividend. Seagate stock trades for just 11 times forward earnings estimates and 1.1 times revenue. Its enterprise value is just 6.6 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.These multiples are very low, meaning the market is factoring in little to no growth going forward. If Seagate can manage to clear what amounts to a very low hurdle, the stock could enjoy a significant snap-back.Plus, investors will receive a very high 4.5% dividend going forward. This compensates investors for waiting for a potential turnaround. Seagate's dividend is a rare find in the market these days, especially for a technology company. Close competitor Western Digital only offers a 2.5% dividend. In fact, Seagate's dividend yield is very close to a five-year high.STX DIVIDEND YIELD (TTM), DATA BY YCHARTS.Seagate's dividend looks well-cushioned with underlying free cash flow, which is a great sign. The company generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow during the first three quarters of its current fiscal year. The dividend cost $493 million in this period, which equates to a very manageable 26% free cash flow payout ratio.If the macroeconomic conditions in the PC industry continue to deteriorate, it will be difficult for Seagate stock to do well. But any improvement in PC shipments during the back half of 2015 could make Seagate a winning investment based on how cheap it is right now. And investors at least have the dividend, which appears secure.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Seagate Technology PLC Fell 14% Thursday,"Oct 15, 2015 at 1:27PM","PHOTO: SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY.What: Shares of Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) fell as much as 14.2% on Thursday morning. The maker of traditional hard drives and other data storage products released preliminary first-quarter results in the early morning hours, triggering a stampede to the exits.So what: When the full results are published at the end of the month, Seagate now expects to report revenues of approximately $2.9 billion. Gross margins will land at roughly 24%. These figures are down from Seagate's original guidance, which pointed to sales of $3.0 billion and 27% gross margins. And of course, analysts had been toeing the official sales guidance line, so the final report will most likely fall short of analyst expectations.Now what: Seagate CEO Steve Luczo blamed the weak margins on low interest in the company's biggest drives at 4 TB and larger. The company sees this market segment as a growth opportunity, and still hopes to see demand picking up in the back half of the calendar year.On the upside, Seagate also noted that its adjusted operating expenses will come in 3% below original guidance thanks to effective cost controls. But these $15 million in cost savings are just a drop in the bucket, and won't be able to outweigh the negative combination of disappointing sales plus thin gross margins.Weak preliminary reports are often seen as the canary in the coal mine, signaling larger issues across entire industries and market sectors. Not this one, though. Seagate's only remaining true rival, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), fell as much as 5.7% on Seagate's news, but quickly bounced back to a far smaller overnight decline. Sector neighbor SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK), which focuses on high-speed Flash storage rather than spinning magnetic disks, actually rose as much as 3.2% instead, entirely ignoring Seagate's bad news.It bears mentioning that SanDisk is embroiled in buyout rumors, with Western Digital posited as one of its potential suitors. Seagate's name hasn't come up in the early rumors, even though the company most certainly could use a turnkey Flash drive solution such as SanDisk.10 stocks we like better than SanDisk CorpWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Netflix, Inc. Continues Its Asian Expansion","Sep 15, 2015 at 9:15AM","Earlier this month, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) embarked on the next stage of its international expansion by launching in Japan. While the company has launched successfully on multiple continents, this was its first move into Asia.A few days later, Netflix announced plans to expand its Asian presence further in early 2016, launching in South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. These are sensible markets for Netflix to tackle. Nevertheless, with each set of new countries it enters, Netflix is delving into riskier and riskier territory.Netflix has thrived in familiar marketsAs Netflix has moved beyond its core U.S. market in the past five years, it has found vastly more success in the countries that look most like its home market.NETFLIX HAS BEEN MOST SUCCESSFUL IN THE MARKETS MOST LIKE THE U.S. For example, Netflix is dominant in Canada. It has gradually built up a strong presence in other Anglophone markets like the U.K. and Ireland. Netflix has also been extremely successful in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands: markets with high English literacy and high broadband penetration.On the other hand, in Latin America -- where fewer people are fluent in English and broadband penetration is lower -- Netflix posted big losses initially and has faced a long slog toward profitability.Netflix's new markets will look more and more like Latin America rather than Canada or the Nordic countries as it reaches the final stage of its global expansion project. The key question is whether Netflix has learned enough in the past few years to accelerate the process of reaching profitability in tougher markets.Is fast Internet enough?The Asian markets that Netflix is entering now have an interesting mix of positive and negative attributes. On the positive side, they all have relatively high GDP per capita, making a service like Netflix affordable, and they have high broadband penetration, making streaming video feasible.English proficiency is a mixed bag. Territories like Singapore and Hong Kong also have very high levels of English fluency, which could make Netflix's English-language original series more valuable there. South Korea and Taiwan are middling in terms of English proficiency, while Japan is far behind the pack.Cultural differences may represent an even bigger barrier to Netflix's expansion. At a high level, American TV content is less popular in these countries than in Netflix's most successful international markets.AMERICAN TV CONTENT MAY NOT BE VERY POPULAR IN MOST ASIAN MARKETS. In Japan -- by far the largest of Netflix's Asian markets -- Netflix confronts the additional headwind of the surprising popularity of old media. For example, physical media still represents 78% of music sales in Japan, whereas digital formats dominate music sales in most of the world.Perhaps this makes the Japanese market ripe for disruption. That certainly wasn't the case for Hulu, though, which pulled out of Japan in 2014 after three unsuccessful years there. To make matters worse, a recent study by Parrot Analytics found that demand for Netflix's original series is much lower in Japan than in the European markets where Netflix is launching this fall.To succeed in Japan -- and perhaps Asia more broadly -- Netflix may need to rely heavily on local content. If so, it would drive up Netflix's costs and increase the amount of time it takes for these markets to reach breakeven.Expect some setbacksNetflix's experience in Latin America shows that even when its service initially flops in a new market, the company can eventually turn things around.That's going to be an important skill in the next few years. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore all look like attractive markets due to their strong GDP per capita and high broadband penetration -- yet there are still plenty of pitfalls related to English literacy, consumer acceptance of streaming video, and local tastes.Ultimately, Netflix is likely to figure these issues out, but it will take time. Furthermore, most of the markets remaining for Netflix to launch in 2016 will be even more like Latin America -- i.e., low in English proficiency, broadband penetration, and GDP per capita.The net result is that investors should be prepared for some setbacks in the next year, compared to the consistently strong results Netflix has posted in 2015. That could increase Netflix stock's volatility next year. But as long as Netflix demonstrates continuous improvement in its more established markets, these dips could be buying opportunities rather than reasons to panic.10 stocks we like better than NetflixWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Papa John's Stock Plunged Today,"Nov 4, 2015 at 1:57PM","What: Shares of pizza chain Papa John's International (NASDAQ:PZZA) were down roughly 14.5% as of 2 p.m. Wednesday after its quarterly results and outlook disappointed Wall Street.So what: Papa John's shares have soared in 2015 on surging earnings, but uninspiring Q3 results -- adjusted EPS of $0.45 only met expectations while revenue declined 0.3% -- coupled with downbeat full-year guidance are forcing investors to quickly recalibrate their growth estimates. In fact, global restaurant sales increased just 3.9% in the quarter compared to growth of 10.2% in the year-ago period, suggesting that the currency and competitive headwinds facing Papa John's are much stronger than Mr. Market had anticipated.Now what: Management now expects full-year 2015 EPS to be at the lower end of its previously expected range of $2.04-$2.10, versus the average analyst estimate of about $2.08. ""Our unwavering focus on quality, combined with our strong digital channels, continues to drive the Papa John's brand forward,"" said founder, Chairman and CEO John Schnatter.

Why Seagate Technology PLC Fell 12.8% in September,"Oct 6, 2015 at 10:50AM","STX DATA BY YCHARTSWhat: Shares of hard-drive builder Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) fell 12.8% in September, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. It was a multi-stage decline, setting fresh two-year lows along the way.So what: First, an analyst research note painted a dark picture for the future of spinning magnetic disks, pushing Seagate shares 4% lower. Then the stock fell another 6% mid-month on no particular news. Layered on top of a generally wobbly market, these events drove Seagate stock as much as 18% lower. A quick bounce at the tail end of September, powered by archrival Western Digital's receiving a large equity investment from China, could only erase about one-third of the damage done earlier in the month.PHOTO: SEAGATE.Now what: Analyst firm UBS Warburg, whose analysis sparked that initial slide, holds a ""sell"" rating on both STX and WDC as their bread-and-butter bulk storage markets move into the hands of flash-based solid-state storage devices. The price gap that has kept magnetic disks competitive so far is eroding, and enterprise customers have started to prefer the dramatically higher performance of SSD storage over the diminishing cost savings in Seagate's and Western Digital's hard drive portfolios.UBS expects PC sales to fall 8% in calendar year 2015 and another 2% in 2016. Paired with the never-ending drop in street prices per terabyte of storage, that pessimistic forecast spells trouble for Seagate and its only remaining hard-drive rival.UBS's estimates are tough but not unreasonable. Flash devices and other -- even faster, but way more expensive -- technologies really do threaten the end of the magnetic disk era as we know it. Seagate had better adapt to the new high-speed markets or die trying.That being said, Seagate's shares already trade at a rock-bottom 8.5 times trailing earnings. The company generated $1 billion of free cash flows over the last four quarters, and the balance sheet's $4.2 billion in total debt is matched by $2.5 billion of cash equivalents. In other words, Seagate won't stand at death's door until the bottom truly falls out of its end markets. That hasn't happened yet, but the stock is priced for total disaster.So this stock stands at a crossroads today. If the UBS analysis turns out to be absolutely correct, then Seagate deserves to trade at these bargain-bin prices. If not, you should expect that compressed P/E multiple to expand and unlock tremendous value in shares bought today.I think the death of the magnetic hard drive will take a bit longer and give Seagate some time to reinvent itself. Still a gamble, but a tempting one at these ultra-low prices."
5 Top Stocks to Buy in September,"Sep 1, 2015 at 7:30PM","The summer of 2015 is fading fast, and we're all getting back to work. As September rolls around, it's high time to take another look at your stock portfolio.A panel of Motley Fool contributors has put together five top-quality stocks worthy of a closer look right now. For the steel-nerved investor, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is selling at a deep discount that could grow even steeper at a moment's notice. For Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED), several long-awaited end markets for its OLED display and lighting technologies are finally reaching maturity. Biotech titan Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) matches deep value to a fantastic drug development pipeline. Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) was recently thrown another lifeline by the Department of Defense, and most investors haven't acted on that game-changing development yet. Car-buying innovator TrueCar (NASDAQ:TRUE) comes off a disappointing report and is looking for a new CEO, but there's plenty of light at the end of that tunnelThat's the bird's-eye view of these top September buying opportunities. For a close-up look, bristling with important detail, just read on:SOURCE: UNIVERSAL DISPLAY.Steve Symington (Universal Display): It seems an understatement to say that Universal Display Corporation investors have endured a roller coaster so far in 2015. Though shares of the OLED specialist are still up more than 30% year to date, they're also down more than 30% from a 52-week-high of nearly $56 per share set in June.For that, investors can thank a combination of the recent broader market pullback and weaker-than-expected second-quarter results announced at the beginning of August. Those results notably included a surprise net loss of $11.8 million, driven by a one-time $33 million writedown of OLED host material inventory and associated work-in-process.As I pointed out in my full earnings take, however, Universal Display management explained that this writedown was the result of massive new OLED product introductions that utilize Universal Display's new red and green emitter materials, which its customers are required to purchase given the scope of UDC's patents. In turn, this negatively affected demand for older products that used its existing host materials, which customers aren't obligated to buy from UDC.But over the long term, the influence of Universal Display's host business should wane as its phosphorescent OLED emitters continue to permeate the market. Universal Display's tech notably won a spot via LG Display (its second-largest customer) in the Apple Watch, for example, and supply chain sources suggest the folks in Cupertino could be planning a complete transition to OLED iPhones and iPads in the coming years.In addition, less than two weeks ago LGD announced it will invest $8.5 billion to expand OLED production over the next three years for OLED televisions, smartphones, wearables, automobile displays, and even rollable and foldable OLED devices. For Universal Display investors willing to patiently watch this growth story unfold, the future looks brighter than ever.SOURCE: NETFLIX.Anders Bylund (Netflix): If you want a brutally volatile stock in your portfolio, Netflix should be right up your alley. I mean that in the best way, since most of the digital video veteran's wild swings go upward, but it's always best to be prepared for ridiculous share price drops as well. Read on for the upside of that terrifying idea.Riding high on a fantastic second-quarter report and the imminent entry into the Japanese market, Netflix shares were hitting all-time highs on a regular basis in early August. Then the stock lost 16% in the span of a single week. That's $8 billion of market cap value shaved off, for no particular reason other than general market jitters.That's the downside of volatility: Sometimes these stocks get caught in a downdraft. Since Netflix stock looks expensive by traditional value metrics, any hint of market weakness makes investors sell it and ""run to safety.""Now, Netflix quickly repaired some of that mid-August damage. The market had a good day in general, so Netflix swung up faster than your average stock. The company also announced a new partnership that should accelerate Netflix's streaming video growth in Japan.As I'm writing this, Netflix shares still trade more than 10% below those early August all-time highs. That's a fine discount on this long-term growth machine, which should finish its high-octane growth phase and convert into a high-margin cash generator by 2017.There's also a very good chance that Netflix shares will drop again in September, for no better reason than butterflies coughing in China. Keep an eye open for baseless price plunges, ready to strike an even better bargain like the one you saw on Aug. 24.THE PENTAGON PICKED OSHKOSH'S L-ATV TO BECOME ITS NEW JOINT LIGHT TACTICAL VEHICLE. PHOTO: OSHKOSH.Rich Smith (Oshkosh): I don't know whether Oshkosh will be the best-performing stock in the world in the month of September, but I've got a strong hunch about the next six months.As you may (or may not) have heard, late last month the U.S. Department of Defense chose Oshkosh as the winner of its multiparty, multiyear contest to build a replacement for the venerable HMMWV (Humvee) jeep. This contract is a big deal for Oshkosh, and potentially transformative. The Washington Post reports the initial contract is for $6.7 billion for 17,000 vehicles and that it could be worth $30 billion or more over time as more than 55,000 of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicles are built for the military.Up until this contract was announced, Oshkosh as a business was on the ropes. Contracts for its MRAP armored vehicles were drying up, and military spending in general was trending down. Oshkosh still labored under a near-$1 billion debt load, and things were not looking good.But here's the thing: Oshkosh has been here before. In similar straits back in the summer of 2009, Oshkosh was awarded the contract to build the Army's M-ATV vehicle (a small, all-terrain MRAP). That contract not only threw Oshkosh a lifeline, but sparked a six-month surge in Oshkosh stock that saw the shares more than triple in value.Will that happen again, this time, with the JLTV contract? I honestly don't know. Last time around, Oshkosh's share surge was turbocharged by the award of a second multimillion-dollar contract (just two months after the M-ATV award) to build a family of Medium Tactical Vehicles for the Army as well. There may be no such double-whammy this year.But with Oshkosh shares selling today for less than 13 times trailing earnings, paying a 1.8% dividend yield, and expected to post 15% annual earnings growth over the next five years, the shares were looking cheap even before the JLTV award was announced. With that win, I think Oshkosh stock looks even cheaper today -- and a great stock to buy in September.BRAND NEW HEPATITIS C TREATMENT HARVONI. SOURCE: GILEAD SCIENCES.Brian Feroldi (Gilead Sciences): When the markets become volatile, I like to go bargain hunting for the strongest businesses that I can find. I think the market is giving us quite a deal right now on shares of biotech giant Gilead Sciences, making it my top choice for new money in September.Gilead currently holds powerhouse positions in fighting two diseases, HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C, with a slew of best-selling drugs that are creating huge growth numbers. Thanks in large part to recently launched hepatitis C treatments Sovaldi and Harvoni, Gilead rang up more than $8.2 billion of revenue in the second quarter alone, up a strong 26% over the year-ago period. This strong growth has given its management team enough confidence to raise its revenue guidance for the second time this year, and the company now expects 2015 revenue to be north of $29 billion.Gilead isn't resting in its laurels either, as it currently boasts 10 new compounds that are either pending regulatory approval or in phase clinical 3 trials, giving it one of the strongest pipelines in the industry. While some of these new compounds are designed to expand its leadership position in its core markets, the company is also looking to enter new disease states like hematology/oncology and cardiovascular disease.While we wait to see if any of these new drugs will work out, Gilead is using its financial might to reward investors with a recently authorized dividend payment that currently yields 1.6% and a massive $15 billion share repurchase program. Investors at today's prices are getting all of this for a stock that's trading at just over nine times 2016 earnings estimates.Growth, value, and income? Count me in.SOURCE: TRUECAR.John Rosevear (TrueCar): Shares of car-buying service TrueCar were crushed after a disappointing second-quarter earnings miss, dropping over 40%. They haven't recovered -- yet. But the company remains the best-positioned player in a market space ripe for disruption, with a still-strong management team. The earnings miss creates an intriguing buying opportunity.Simply put, TrueCar partners with new-car dealers and uses the data it gathers from sales to provide transparent pricing to prospective car buyers, which it then connects with the dealers. Dealers get a steady stream of buyers via the company's online service and mobile apps, and buyers get great data and -- ideally -- a lower-stress car-shopping experience.The company is currently seeking a new CEO; founder Scott Painter agreed to give up the role after the company's poor second-quarter showing. But that new CEO will have a strong veteran team in place: John Krafcik (president) was the former chief of Hyundai North America, Larry Dominique (executive vice president) ran product planning for Nissan's Western Hemisphere operations, and CFO Michael Guthrie has decades of experience in venture capital and technology companies.TrueCar isn't without risks. Its relationships with dealers have often been rocky, with mistrust on both sides. But it still expects to generate over $250 million in revenue this year, with sales and market share growing. At current prices, TrueCar shares could look like a steal a year from now."
4 Best Stocks to Invest in the Dental Business,"Jun 5, 2015 at 8:45AM","The investment thesis behind investing in the dental business is simple. An aging Western population with better access to dental healthcare means many more teeth will need treatment in the future.Moreover, increasing standards of healthcare in the developing world offer ample opportunities for the dental business abroad as well. Throw in the relatively recession-resistant nature of the industry and you have a bullish case for this business. So which are the best stocks to buy in the dental business?The usual suspectColgate-Palmolive Co. (NYSE:CL) is the most obvious candidate. Oral care products made up 46% of its worldwide sales in 2014, and 86% of its net sales to Asia.Colgate-Palmolive's prospects are largely dependent on its ability to grow its business in developing markets. A breakout of the company's market share in toothpaste in various countries demonstrates its dominance in key emerging markets.SOURCE: COLGATE-PALMOLIVE CO. PRESENTATIONS.A look at of its pre-corporate cost operating profit in 2014 demonstrates the importance of its operations in Latin America and Asia.SOURCE: COLGATE-PALMOLIVE CO. PRESENTATIONS. ALL REGIONAL FIGURES ARE FOR ITS ORAL, PERSONAL, AND HOME CARE UNITS.As such, Colgate-Palmolive is really a play on growth in developing markets and the company's ability to expand sales in areas such as toothbrushes (33.8% of worldwide market share) and mouthwash (16.5%).Patterson Cos. and Henry ScheinInvestors can also buy into the sector via medical-supply distributors such as Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO) and Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC).Both companies rely heavily on their dental segments: Patterson's (North American-focused) dental segment made up 59% of its total sales in its recent fourth quarter, while dental sales provided more than 50% of Henry Schein's global sales in its first quarter. For the record, Henry Schein generated 64% of its first-quarter dental sales from North America.As the following charts show, both companies grew revenue during the last recession, and they tend to convert more than 100% of net income into free cash flow.SOURCE: HENRY SCHEIN, INC. PRESENTATIONS.SOURCE: PATTERSON COMPANIES, INC.As such, both companies can be looked at as relatively recession-proof businesses with good cash flow generation properties. If you believe in the dental industry's long-term growth prospects, then they are well worth a look.The growth candidateSirona Dental Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:SIRO) represents the growth opportunity in the sector. The excitement for this dental equipment maker revolves around its CEREC CAD/CAM system, which enables dentists to perform same-day teeth restorations. Incidentally, Sirona's products are distributed by Patterson in the U.S. and by Henry Schein in Europe.Sirona's growth can be a bit lumpy as it is somewhat dependent on the timing of new product releases. In other words, growth can accelerate as new CEREC or imaging systems are released, only to slow as they mature.Indeed, analysts expect Sirona's revenue to decline 2.6% in its fiscal year ending this September, only to bounce back to 8.4% revenue growth in the year ending in September 2016.As shown in the chart below, Sirona's revenue and operating income have grown strongly in recent years.SOURCE: SIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC. PRESENTATIONS.Sirona will aim to increase penetration rates of its CEREC CAD/CAM systems. With the growing number of older people in need of teeth restorations across the world, it will be more economically viable for dentists to acquire the CEREC system. That would be good news for Sirona.The takeawayColgate-Palmolive represents the blue-chip way to play long-term growth in dental hygiene, with a particular focus on emerging markets. Patterson and Henry Schein offer investors strong cash generation and some recession proof characteristics -- never a bad idea in a long-term holding.

3 Reasons to Buy Match Group Inc.,"Dec 7, 2015 at 2:07PM","Online dating giant Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) made its public-market debut last month. The stock has attracted a fair amount of criticism: Analysts at BTIG initiated coverage with a sell rating. Still, there are reasons to like Match Group, as it remains one of the only ways for investors to get exposure to the online-dating industry.1. It's profitable and it's growingRecent IPOs generally make for speculative investments, as new companies often operate at a loss. But that's not the case for Match Group. It's a profitable company, and it has been for the last three years. In 2014, it earned $148.4 million, up from $126.6 million in 2013. It's also growing revenue. For the first six months of the year, it generated nearly $484 million, up 14.7% from the same period in 2014.SOURCE: MATCHGROUPINC.COMAbout 60% of its revenue -- its biggest component -- comes directly from users of its dating services in North America. This generally takes the form of membership subscriptions. Despite the growing deluge of free services, Match's direct revenue has been rising -- up 10.9% on an annual basis in the first half of the year. Match Group's services include Match, OkCupid, Tinder, Meetic, Plentyoffish, OurTime, and BlackPeopleMeet. It offers its products in 38 languages across 190 countries. It also operates The Princeton Review, which offers test preparation, tutoring and college counseling.2. Its addressable market is expected to grow significantlyMatch estimates its total addressable market at around 511 million people. That's based on the number of single adults with Internet access in North America, Western Europe, and other select countries. As the population grows, Match's addressable market should increase.It will also benefit from greater broadband penetration rates in countries such as China and India, where limited Internet access currently limits the feasibility of online dating services. By 2019, Match estimates that it's total addressable market will rise to 672 million -- an increase of more than 30%.To some extent, online dating remains in its infancy. The stigma that surrounds it has faded over the last few years, but even today, there's still room for improvement.In 2005, about one-third of Americans believed that people who used online dating websites were ""desperate,"" and only 44% thought it was a good way to meet people, according to Pew Research. In 2013, about 59% of Americans said they thought it was a good way to meet people, and only about one-fifth classified users of online dating websites as desperate. Still, according to the survey, only 22% of Americans between the ages of 25-34 -- the prime demographic for online dating services -- had used online dating websites or apps. The percentage was even lower among other age groups.3. It owns most of the major dating brands, and has shown ability to innovateThere are a wide variety of online dating services, but Match owns many of the most popular, including Tinder, Match.com, and OKCupid. Although they don't function like traditional social networks -- users join and leave based on their relationship status -- their value depends on their network of users; the more the better. In this sense, Match's scale is advantageous, as 89% of North American singles are familiar with at least one of Match's services.Match admits that new online-dating services could arise to challenge its offerings in the future, but remains committed to innovation and developing additional products of its own. In 2011, it created OurTime, which targets older people, and in 2012 it developed mobile-only Tinder, which is aimed at millennials and might make up a large percentage of Match's total user base. Match's brands, in total, had 59 million monthly active users as of the end of September. Exactly how many were from Tinder, it didn't say, but analysts had pegged the number at around 24 million last year.As society becomes ever-more digital, the stigma that surrounds online dating should recede even further, and more singles could turn to Match's services.10 stocks we like better than Match GroupWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

How Do Money Orders Work?,"Jun 12, 2015 at 10:21AM","IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL.Money orders may not be the most innovative or technologically advanced payment method, but they can come in very handy in many situations. What is a money order, and when should you use one?What is a money order?A money order is basically a tool to transfer money or make payments. Think of it as an alternative to a check. However, while checks and money orders can serve a similar function, and they also look quite similar, there are some important differences to consider.Unlike regular checks, money orders are prepaid. That means they're backed by large agencies or corporations instead of individuals, making them especially valuable because of the safety and reliability they provide.You can purchase a money order with cash or with a debit or credit card. They're available for sale at banks, credit unions, the U.S. Post Office, and even Wal-Mart stores. Most money orders typically have a $1,000 limit, so you may need to purchase multiple money orders to make payments for bigger amounts. There's also a small cost attached. Money orders from USPS cost a maximum of $1.65 per $1,000, but banks and credit unions can charge considerably more.After you purchase the money order, you need to fill in the name of the recipient, as well as your name. In many cases you're also required to provide additional data, such as your address and phone number.Money orders include a receipt, which the purchaser needs to keep until the order is cashed. This receipt works as proof that the holder is indeed the payer of the order. The receipt also includes a tracking number, which can be used to make sure the money got to the right recipient.When should you use a money order?In times of flourishing digital payments, money orders may look like an antiquated alternative. However, they can be remarkably useful in some specific situations. For example, many people who don't have a checking account routinely rely on money orders to pay their rent or utility bills.When trying to send money by mail, money orders are a far safer alternative to cash. Cash can be easily stolen, and the recipient can also misleadingly claim that the money wasn't received after pocketing the cash, leaving the payer in a difficult situation.But money orders are payable to a specific individual or organization, just like checks, so this feature considerably reduces reduces the risks in case of theft. Besides, payment can be canceled for security reasons when the payer believes the money order has been stolen.The payer can also monitor when a money order has been cashed, making it much harder for the recipient to deceive the payer by saying that the money order didn't arrive at the specified destination.Also, checks include your bank account information, which can be a problem when you don't know or trust the recipient enough to share that data. Money orders don't show your bank account information. However, you still need to be careful, since money orders may also include address and phone numbers, and your signature can still be forged.Money orders are also especially helpful when the receiver doesn't want to run the risk of being paid with a check that won't be honored because of insufficient funds. Money orders have already been paid with cash upfront, and the instrument is guaranteed by the issuer, which is typically a big, reputable corporation. Unlike with personal checks, there is almost no risk that a money order will bounce back because of lack of funds. On the other hand, money orders can still be falsified, so that's an important risk to watch on the receiver's end.Money orders are clearly not the most efficient or comfortable payment method available, but they do offer considerable advantages in key areas such as transparency, security, and simplicity. For some specific uses, money orders can be a smart choice."
"Apple, Inc. vs. Tencent Holdings: Who Can Sell More Music in China?","Jun 14, 2015 at 2:40PM","Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has done very well in China since the launch of the iPhone 6. Revenue from the Greater China region rose 71% annually last quarter, accounting for 29% of Apple's top line. Last month, Apple overtook Xiaomi as the country's top smartphone maker, with nearly 15% of the market, according to IDC.APPLE MUSIC. SOURCE: APPLE.However, that probably still won't be enough to help Apple's new streaming music platform, Apple Music, gain much ground among Chinese users. In Western markets, Apple Music is considered a major threat to streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora Media. But in China, Apple must deal with cultural differences, lower price expectations, and intense competition from local rivals.The business of Chinese music streamingOne key problem is that Chinese listeners are used to getting their music for free. There are over 100 pirated music websites in China. The most popular one reportedly gets 168.5 million visits per month: far more than any legitimate music download site. In China, 478 million people -- more than the entire population of the United States -- listen to music online. Yet Chinese users only paid $91 million for digital music last year, compared to $3.5 billion in the U.S., according to IFPI estimates.Despite that massive disparity, Chinese companies have launched legitimate subscription-based streaming platforms. Internet giant Tencent offers QQ Music, a Spotify-like service that lets users stream most songs for free with ads.QQ MUSIC. SOURCE: GOOGLE PLAY.QQ Music's premium Green Diamond membership, which costs $1.60 per month, offers a number of perks. Listeners can remove ads, get higher-quality sound, access members-only concerts, and win souvenirs and backstage passes. Green Diamond members also get free virtual items in Tencent's online games, which are tethered to Qzone, its social network that has 668 million monthly active users. Members can also add personal radio stations to their Qzone pages.Not much revenue, but plenty of rivalsTencent doesn't disclose its membership figures, but research firm Analysys International estimated that the mobile app has roughly 80 million monthly active (both free and paying) users. By comparison, Spotify recently announced that it had 20 million paid subscribers out of 75 million active listeners.A monthly fee of $1.60 seems paltry compared to Apple Music and Spotify's monthly fee of $9.99. Still, labels including Sony Music Entertainment, Time Warner's Warner Music Group, and South Korea's YG Entertainment have all signed distribution deals with Tencent, since it's one of the only ways to sell digital music legitimately to Chinese listeners.Tencent isn't the only company to adopt a freemium, perks-based digital music model in China. However, roughly 80% of the market is controlled by just five services, with QQ Music, Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) Music, and Alibaba's(NYSE:BABA) TTPOD being the three largest.BAIDU MUSIC. SOURCE: GOOGLE PLAY.What Apple must doIf Apple wants to launch Apple Music in China, it needs to lower the price. Counterpoint Research analyst Neil Shah told The Wall Street Journal that to enter China, Apple Music needs to cost ""about $2 to $5 per month"" and should include ""more meaningful and valuable premium features.""While Apple might be willing to lower its prices, it lacks the app and social ecosystem muscle of its Chinese rivals. However, Apple has industry clout, since its iTunes Store still accounts for up to 85% of all digital music sales worldwide. By combining streaming music and paid downloads, musicians generate digital album sales alongside streaming royalties. That's why top musicians such as Taylor Swift and Coldplay have pulled their songs off Spotify and signed with Apple instead.Swift, who said her music ""should not be free,"" requested last November that her albums be pulled from Chinese streaming platforms, and top players like Tencent and Alibaba complied. Therefore, if Apple enters China with the blessing of Swift and other popular artists not found on rival platforms, it might gain a competitive advantage.A tough uphill battleApple's dilemma with Apple Music is similar to the one Microsoft faced with its software in China. In 2011, then-CEO Steve Ballmer complained that Microsoft's Chinese software revenue was only equivalent to 5% of its U.S. revenue, although the two countries had about the same number of PC users.The problem is that rampant piracy has made it tough to establish legitimate business models. The Chinese government is cracking down on these sites, but two or more heads usually grow back (via mirror sites) after one is lopped off.Apple hasn't stated yet whether it intends to expand Apple Music to China. It's a massive market, but the meager revenue might not be worth all the trouble.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

SWOT Analysis of Starbucks Corporation (SBUX),"Jun 19, 2015 at 8:15AM","Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock has soared more than 40% in the past 12 months, handily outperforming the S&P 500's 8% gain. But after that big rally, investors might wonder whether it's time to unload some shares. To decide, let's do a basic SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis of Starbucks' business.StrengthsStarbucks has a solid record of top- and bottom-line growth. From fiscal 2010 to 2014, the java house's annual revenue rose 53% and earnings per share more than doubled. The company expects revenue to rise 16% to 18% this year, compared to 11% top-line growth in 2014. Starbucks recently took full control of Starbucks Japan, which should boost its top line this year with over $1 billion in incremental revenue.SOURCE: STARBUCKS.Since 2010, Starbucks' global store count has risen 31% to 22,088 company-operated and licensed locations. The company has also consistently posted comparable sales growth while increasing its store count -- something many growing chains fail to do.Last quarter, Starbucks' comparable sales rose 7% annually, with 7% growth in the Americas, 12% growth in the CAP (China/Asia-Pacific) region, and 2% growth in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) region. Starbucks' comparable sales growth crushes rivals such as McDonald's and Dunkin' Brands' Dunkin' Donuts. Last quarter, McDonald's global comparable sales slipped 2.3% annually. Dunkin' Donuts reported 2.7% U.S. comp growth and 1.7% global comp growth.WeaknessesStarbucks' main weakness is uneven international growth. The Americas and CAP markets are faring well, but the EMEA region might weaken further due to economic troubles across that region. Although comparable-store sales rose in the EMEA region last quarter, revenue declined 10% year over year due to foreign currency impacts and a shift toward more licensed stores.Those gloomy results were offset by a massive 124% jump in revenue from the CAP region, mainly fueled by the acquisition of Starbucks Japan. Looking ahead, though, Asian currencies remain weak against the strong dollar, and economic slowdowns in China and Japan could throttle the CAP region's long-term growth.Starbucks is also spending a large amount of money on expansion. Last quarter, operating expenses jumped 17% annually to $3.84 billion, or 84% of its top line. Fortunately, rising revenue offset those expenses, boosting operating income by 21%. Nonetheless, investors should watch to see if the CAP region's growth can keep offsetting the EMEA region's shortcomings.OpportunitiesTo sustain Starbucks' growth in the CAP region, the company is boosting its store count, particularly in China. The idea is that rising incomes in China should fuel higher demand for ""premium"" Western products including Starbucks coffee. Starbucks recently opened its 1,600th store in China, and it plans to double its location count in the CAP region as a whole to around 10,000 within the next five years.Another area of growth is consumer packaged goods, such as coffee beans and branded K-Cups, which piggyback off the success of Keurig Green Mountain's Keurig home-brewing machines. During Starbucks' second-quarter conference call, CEO Howard Schultz noted that his company was the ""No. 1 premium coffee brand in the K-Cup category,"" with more than 2.5 billion K-Cup pack shipments since launch.SOURCE: STARBUCKS.Starbucks is also experimenting with various concept stores. Over the past two years, Starbucks has opened tea bars, wine bars, and even ""coffee museum"" stores. If any of these ideas stick, Starbucks might evolve or expand them to boost sales.ThreatsOne ongoing threat to Starbucks' business is the unstable price of coffee, which is defined by the price per kilogram of pricier Arabica beans and cheaper Robusta beans. Starbucks, McDonald's, and Dunkin' Donuts generally buy Arabica beans, while Robusta beans are mainly used in supermarket brands and instant coffee.SOURCE: YCHARTSIf Starbucks thinks coffee prices will rise next year, it signs supply contracts to ""lock in"" that year's supply at current prices. As of last quarter, Starbucks had locked in nearly 70% of its coffee supply for 2016. But if coffee prices fall below Starbucks' locked-in price, it loses money on that bet.Another threat is rising competition, notably across the United States and Canada. Starbucks has a healthy presence in the western and central U.S., but Dunkin' Donuts is firmly entrenched across the eastern seaboard, while Tim Hortons has a strong presence along the Canadian border.

Better Value Play: Western Digital Corp. or Seagate Technology PLC?,"May 6, 2016 at 9:09AM","Hard-drive makers Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) were both recently pummeled after reporting dismal third-quarter earnings. Both companies were hit hard by a slowdown in PC sales and the cannibalization of HDDs (hard-disk drives) by SSDs (solid-state drives).IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.Shares of WD and Seagate have both declined more than 60% over the past 12 months, which boosted their dividend yields to historic highs. But does that make either stock an attractive income-generating value play?How bad were the numbers?During the first quarter, WD's revenue fell 20.6% annually to $2.82 billion, which missed forecasts by $40 million. Seagate's revenue dropped 21.9% to $2.6 billion, which matched estimates. Both companies' revenues have been falling ever since 2013 and aren't expected to bottom anytime soon.SOURCE: YCHARTS.WD's hard drive shipments declined 21% annually to 43.1 million as sales into notebooks, desktops, consumer electronics, branded devices, and enterprise products all weakened. Seagate's shipments declined 22% to 39.2 million, with enterprise and client computing drive sales falling but consumer electronics and branded shipments slightly rising.Both companies' non-GAAP gross margins narrowed. WD's declined from 30.5% a year ago to 28.1%, while Seagate's fell from 28.9% a year ago to 22.7%. That decline caused WD's non-GAAP net income to fall 26% annually to $283 million, or $1.21 per share, missing estimates by $0.07. Seagate's non-GAAP net income plunged 82% to $66 million, or $0.22 per share, which came in $0.15 below expectations. The long-term chart also reveals a clear downtrend in earnings growth.SOURCE: YCHARTS.Pivoting toward new marketsWD is trying to offset its losses in HDDs by pivoting toward SSDs and flash memory. It's doing this inorganically through the acquisitions of Hitachi's hard drive business, SSD maker STec, enterprise storage company Virident Systems, storage software maker Velobit, flash storage array maker Skyera, and flash storage giant SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK). After the SanDisk deal closes, WD will control around 14% of the global SSD market, making it the second largest vendor after market leader Samsung.WD also expects the full integration of HGST (Hitachi Global Storage Technologies) -- which was cleared by Chinese regulators last October -- to generate $800 million in cost savings by the end of 2017, up from its prior guidance of $650 million.Seagate spent a lot of money consolidating the fragmented HDD market over the past decade, but it's spent a lot less money on SSDs and flash memory. The company's main foothold in that market is a multi-year NAND supply and enterprise SSD alliance with Micron (NASDAQ:MU), which controls around 10% of the SSD market. It also produces SSHDs (solid-state hybrid drives), which boot up faster than an HDD but cost much less than an SSD. Like WD, Seagate will generate some cost savings from its full integration of Samsung's HDD operations, which was also approved by Chinese regulators last year.But investing in SSDs might not be enoughWD and Seagate are trying to counter the cannibalization of their core HDD businesses by diversifying into SSDs, but both companies could merely be shifting from one commoditized market into another.DRAMeXchange claims that 2.5"" SSDs cost 11 times more than HDDs on a dollar per GB basis in 2012, but they now only cost about 6.5 times as much. The company expects that gap to narrow to 2.8 times in 2017 and potentially achieve price parity a few years later. If this happens before WD and Seagate diversify enough of their business away from HDDs, their core businesses could collapse.Valuations and dividendsWD trades at 9 times earnings, and Seagate has a higher P/E of 18, but both ratios remain lower than the industry average of 23 for data storage companies. Looking ahead, analysts expect WD's earnings to fall 1.5% annually over the next five years, while Seagate's earnings are expected to decline 6%.WD's forward dividend yield of 5.1% looks sustainable with a payout ratio of 44%, but the company suspended buybacks to pay off debt related to the SanDisk acquisition. Meanwhile, Seagate's forward dividend yield of 13% looks completely unsustainable with a payout ratio well over 200%.The better value play: Western DigitalWD and Seagate are both in bad shape, but WD is clearly the better pick. Its margins are higher, its valuations are lower, its dividend is sustainable, and it's better invested in the future through its acquisition of SanDisk. Seagate must make big changes to keep up -- otherwise it could be left in the dust by WD, Samsung, and other major storage players within the next few years."
Will 2016 Be Western Digital Corp's Worst Year Yet?,"Jan 21, 2016 at 11:34AM","Shares of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) have tumbled more than 20% since the beginning of the year, extending its 12-month decline to 56%. However, that drop has reduced its trailing P/E to just 8, a big discount to the industry average of 15, while its dividend yield has hit a historic high of 4.2%. Do those figures now make Western Digital a compelling value stock? Or could 2016 be the storage device maker's worst year yet?SOURCE: PIXABAY.The good newsWestern Digital and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) control over 80% of the global market for platter-based hard disk drives (HDDs). But over the past decade, the HDD market has been cannibalized by flash-based solid state drives (SSDs). SSDs are more expensive than HDDs, but they run faster, use less power, don't have damage-prone platters, and fit better in ultrathin notebooks and tablets. Between the third quarters of 2011 and 2015, TrendFocus estimates that global HDD shipments fell from 175.3 million to 118.6 million.To counter that decline, Western Digital expanded its core business away from HDDs and toward SSDs. It acquired Hitachi's hard drive business, SSD maker STec, enterprise storage firm Virident Systems, storage software maker Velobit, flash storage array maker Skyera, and flash storage giant SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK). WD will control 14% of the SSD market after the SanDisk deal closes, according to Kitguru. That will make it the second largest SSD maker in the world after Samsung, which controls nearly half the market.There were also two positive developments for WD in China last year. First, state-backed Tsinghua's Unisplendour bought a 15% stake in the company to expand its data storage portfolio. Second, the Chinese government finally approved WD's integration of Hitachi's hard drive business after three years of antitrust-related delays. The combination of WD and Hitachi's manufacturing and supply operations should cut production costs of data storage devices for the Chinese market. To balance out the market, the Chinese government also approved Seagate's integration of Samsung's HDD operations, which had been stalled for similar reasons.The bad newsThe problem with Western Digital's SSD strategy is that it's a costly one that was arguably executed too late. WD will fund the $19 billion SanDisk acquisition by taking on $18.4 billion in debt and suspending its buyback program. By comparison, it finished last quarter with $2.1 billion in long-term debt and $5.9 billion in total liabilities. WD will keep paying dividends, but it's unclear if it can keep raising that payout annually. WD's buyout offer also valued SanDisk at 35 times earnings -- a steep premium considering that analysts expect SanDisk's earnings to decline 2% annually over the next five years.SOURCE: PIXABAY.DRAMeXchange recently noted that 2.5-inch SSDs cost 11 times more than HDDs on a dollar-per-GB basis in 2012, but they now cost just 6.5 times as much. The company also expects next-gen 3D NAND technology to narrow that gap to just 2.8 times by 2017. SanDisk notably lags behind Samsung in 3D NAND technology, which means that WD's HDD commoditization problems could play out again with SSDs.To make matters worse, sales of PCs, which are crucial to HDD and SSD makers, continue to decline. IDC recently estimated that global PC shipments fell 10.6% annually in the fourth quarter of 2015. Although the market is expected to stabilize this year as more consumers replace their aging PCs, that growth might coincide with bigger price declines in HDDs and SSDs.Lower demand and price declines will weigh down WD and Seagate's margins and bottom line growth. Last quarter, WD's gross margin fell from 29.1% in the prior year quarter to 28.4%. Seagate's fell from 28.1% to 24.2%. Looking ahead, growth looks weak -- analysts expect WD's annual earnings to grow just 2.3% annually over the next five years, and for Seagate's to rise 4%. That gives WD and Seagate respective 5-year PEG ratios of 3.2 and 2.7. Since a PEG ratio under 1 is considered undervalued, neither stock looks cheap based on its earnings growth potential.Will it be Western Digital's worst year yet?2016 probably won't be pretty for Western Digital, but it probably won't be the company's ""worst"" year yet. Its worst years in recent history were 2008, when the stock lost three-fourths of its value, and 2015, when it plunged nearly 50%. For now, WD's low P/E and 4.2% yield will probably limit its downside potential. However, its upside potential will also probably be limited because of ongoing concerns about sluggish PC sales and the commoditization of the HDD and SSD markets.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Why SanDisk, Western Digital, and Seagate Technology Plunged in 2015","Jan 12, 2016 at 2:00PM","What: Shares of SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) fell 22.4% in 2015, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. Fellow data storage specialists Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) plunged 45.8% and 44.9% lower, respectively. It was a tough year for storage stocks in general.So what: SanDisk's massive loss actually includes a 60% gain in October, where Western Digital agreed to buy the solid-state storage specialist for nearly 35 times SanDisk's trailing earnings. Without that buyout premium, SanDisk investors would have faced an even larger negative return in 2015.You'll note, of course, that the deal did nothing to lift Western Digital out of its year-long swan dive. All three companies suffered from the same overarching market trends: Plunging PC system sales, the never-ending march toward lower component prices, and weak demand even from the enterprise sector.SNDK REVENUE (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.Now what: Western Digital's buyout of SanDisk can be seen as two sinking ships trying to stay afloat by clinging together.The reality is that data storage of all kinds is becoming a commodity. Charging a premium for higher storage density or faster access used to juice the margins and support revenues even in the face of rapidly falling prices per megabyte, then gigabyte, terabyte, and beyond. That's not really the case right now.The traditional hard drive space is down to two strong providers, namely Western Digital and Seagate, plus fringe player Toshiba. Hard drives are going obsolete, and the newfangled solid state drives are still too expensive.Eventually, this snarled market environment will sort itself out. Western Digital, with SanDisk's solid-state expertise under its wing, will start building Flash-based storage into every device it sells. Seagate must be working feverishly on its own Flash technologies, perhaps looking around for a billion-dollar acquisition of its own in that space.Look up ""cyclical"" in a dictionary, and you might just see a picture of a hard drive. This market goes in waves, and is currently on a downswing after a few strong years. Will 2016 be different? Hard to say, but there will eventually be a light at the end of the tunnel.In 2015, that light was still far away, covered up, and turned off.10 stocks we like better than SanDisk CorpWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Western Digital Corp. Fell 13.5% in April,"May 15, 2016 at 10:23AM","What: Shares of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) fell 13.5% in April 2016, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The hard-drive giant mirrored the chart moves produced by Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), but with a much lower amplitude. By the end of the month, Seagate's plunge had stretched all the way to 36.8%.So what: When Seagate lowered its quarterly sales and margin guidance, Western Digital took a sympathy plunge to the tune of 7%. That was nowhere near Seagate's 22% pain, partly because the news wasn't Western Digital's own, and partly because the company had some good news of its own that could soften the blow. That day, Western Digital also closed the books on $5.2 billion of debt notes, bringing the company one step closer to consummating its merger with SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK).The SanDisk deal is a crucial move that could keep Western Digital relevant for years beyond the death of hard drives based on magnetic platters. Seagate has no equivalent play on the solid-state drive market, where data is stored on flash-based memory chips. Hence, news items that take Western Digital closer to that merger can cancel out negativity from the traditional hard-drive segment.When both companies reported earnings on April 28, Seagate fell far short of Wall Street's estimates while Western Digital came much closer. On top of that, SanDisk also reported results the same night -- and beat expectations. So Seagate fell another 19% the next day, but Western Digital's drop was a more subdued 11%. Still painful, but it could have been worse.Now what: Seagate is swimming in dire straits these days, while Western Digital appears to have a viable long-term plan. Closing that SanDisk deal is absolutely essential, but the final roadblock fell on May 10. After final approval from Chinese regulators, the deal is now expected to close on May 12.As the merger unfurled, Western Digital shares have fallen more than 60% over the last 52 weeks. Buy today, and you'll lock in a solid 5.2% dividend yield. And Western Digital can back its payouts with just 56% of its trailing earnings or 31% of free cash flows. Seagate's dividend payments don't come with that kind of cash-based guarantee.If I had to pick a hard drive play at this point, Western Digital looks like the healthier choice -- and the race isn't even close.10 stocks we like better than SanDisk CorpWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons Western Digital Stock Could Fall,"Jan 27, 2016 at 2:00PM","The last year has been brutal for Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) investors. Shares of the hard drive-maker have plunged more than 55% in the last 12 months, badly underperforming the broader S&P 500.WDC DATA BY YCHARTSAt current levels, Western Digital appears intriguing, if for nothing other than its valuation. With a single-digit price-to-earnings ratio, and a dividend yield of about 4.4%, Western Digital looks attractive. But looks can be deceiving. Below are three reasons why Western Digital stock could be headed even lower. While a general market rally could always lift shares even if all three scenarios come to pass, they aren't likely to excite Western Digital investors.PC sales could continue to fallWestern Digital remains dependent on the market for traditional PCs. If you purchase a new desktop or laptop computer, there's a good chance it will come equipped with a Western Digital hard drive. Last quarter, about 34% of the company's revenue came from PCs. Western Digital has been working to shift its business away from the PC in recent years, and while it's been successful (PC-related revenue generated a massive 66% of revenue in fiscal year 2012), for the time being, PC sales remain vital to the firm.Sales of traditional PCs have been declining for most of the last five years. Last quarter in particular saw PC shipments fall 8.3% on an annual basis, according to research firm Gartner. In total, PC shipments fell 8% in 2015, and Gartner expects the market to contract another 1% in 2016.Western Digital's management isn't overly optimistic, but the company made some positive remarks during its earnings call in October. ""[In terms of] the PC market, we are continuing to see some signs of stabilization in demand,"" said Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan on the company's October earnings call.Even as it works to diversify, falling PC sales could weigh on Western Digital's performance.Falling flash demand could undermine its SanDisk acquisitionOne way Western Digital has diversified is by expanding into flash storage. Last year, Western Digital announced that it would acquire flash storage giant SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK). Western Digital has its own flash storage solutions (it sells solid state drives to enterprise customers), but SanDisk is a more significant player.SanDisk itself has struggled over the last 12 months -- even with Western Digital's pending offer, shares are down nearly 20% in the last year. In the September quarter, revenue fell 17% on an annual basis.Western Digital expects its acquisition of SanDisk to enhance its growth. ""Do we expect the SanDisk business to grow over time?"" Milligan asked on the company's October earnings call. ""The answer to that is yes."" Milligan drew particular attention to SanDisk's solid state drives, but also cited growth in mobile devices, including tablets and smartphones.The demand for client solid state drives -- which are used in higher-end desktop and laptop computers -- is tied to the PC market, and is therefore susceptible to falling PC demand. Sales of solid state drives generated about 29% of SanDisk's revenue in fiscal year 2014. SanDisk's mobile solutions, meanwhile, generated about 22% of revenue. Sales of smartphones and tablets have been outpacing demand for traditional PCs, but have also showed some signs of weakness. Last month, research firm IDC forecast that total smartphone shipments would rise in 2015, but that the growth rate would fall into the low single-digits.Falling demand for flash storage could undermine the combined company.The Unisplendour deal could fall throughIt's worth noting that, while it's expected to close, Western Digital's deal to acquire SanDisk hasn't gone through yet. It may not close at all if another separate (yet related) deal falls through.Back in September, China's Unisplendour Corporation announced that it would acquire about 15% of Western Digital. The proceeds from the deal would go toward strengthening Western Digital's balance sheet, and ultimately allow it to acquire SanDisk. The problem for Western Digital investors is that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) needs to approve the Unisplendour deal. It's a different situation, but earlier this month, Philips announced that it had cancelled a deal to sell a majority stake in its LED business to an Asian investment group after the CFIUS raised concerns. Citing problems with the CFIUS, analysts at Credit Agricole warned that the Unisplendour deal is looking increasingly shaky. News of the Unisplendour deal sent shares of Western Digital rising when it was announced last fall. If that deal falls through, it could have the opposite effect."
Will Western Digital Raise Its Dividend in 2016?,"Jan 28, 2016 at 10:20AM","WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DRIVE. SOURCE: WESTERN DIGITALStorage giant Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) doesn't have much of a history as a dividend payer. The company instituted its dividend less than four years ago, announcing its first dividend in Sept., 2012. But since then, Western Digital has hiked its dividend three times, and in the process, has become quite a stock for income-seeking investors. Currently, Western Digital shares yield an attractive 4.4%.But Western Digital's core business -- the sale of traditional hard drives -- appears challenged by technological change and slowing demand, and its proposed acquisition of high-flying peer SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) could undermine its balance sheet. What's more, that high dividend yield has been driven more by a collapse in share price (down more than 55% in the last 12 months) than a soaring payout, as investors have begun to doubt the fundamentals of Western Digital's business. Let's take a closer look at Western Digital to see if investors should expect a dividend hike in 2016.Dividend stats on Western DigitalCurrent Quarterly Dividend Per Share$0.50Current Yield 4.41%Number of Consecutive Years With Dividend Increases 3 years (since 2013)Payout Ratio 31.47%Last Increase April 2015DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE. LAST INCREASE REFERS TO EX-DIVIDEND DATEA commitment to capital returnsWestern Digital instituted its dividend in the midst of a slowdown in its business. Declining PC shipments, coupled with the rise of ever more affordable solid state drives, created doubt about the validity of Western Digital's long-term prospects. At the time, the company said it would aim to return about 50% of its free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. Since then, Western Digital has boosted its dividend and bought back billions of dollars worth of stock.Western Digital remains profitable, and has billions in the bank. In its fiscal year first quarter, Western Digital generated $394 million of free cash flow, and ended the quarter with $5.1 billion of cash. It paid out $115 million to shareholders in the form of dividend payments. Barring a sharp downturn in its business, continued dividend payments with regular increases seem likely.Taking on debt to buy SanDiskOr at least they did until last October, when Western Digital announced it would be acquiring SanDisk for about $18.9 billion. Western Digital plans to finance the acquisition through a combination of cash, common stock, and debt. Western Digital expects to take on $18.1 billion of new debt facilities in connection with its SanDisk purchase. Immediately following the announcement, Western Digital suspended its share repurchase program, despite having a $2.1 billion authorization left.The deal doesn't look all that bad for Western Digital's balance sheet, however, as China's Unisplendour is slated to infuse the hard drive-maker with billions of dollars. Last September, Unisplendour announced a deal to acquire 15% of Western Digital for about $3.8 billion, buying newly issued common stock.Yet the fate of both deals remains in jeopardy. Western Digital and Unisplendour must first gain the approval of the U.S. Committee of Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Earlier this month, the CFIUS blocked Philips' planned sale of its lighting business to a group of Asian buyers, and it could do the same to Western Digital. To complicate matters further, Unisplendour's vice chairman and president Qi Lian recently resigned.If the Unisplendour deal falls through, the terms of Western Digital's acquisition will change, and its shareholders will have to approve the merger with SanDisk. That might prove difficult, given that, after the deal was announced last October, Western Digital shares plunged.Ignoring the ongoing shifts in the storage business, Western Digital's fate seems complex and multifaceted, and it's difficult to say whether or not Western Digital will raise its dividend yet again in 2016. With such a high yield, Western Digital appears attractive to income-hungry investors, but don't count on regular increases."
Why Shares of Western Digital Corp. Slumped Today,"Apr 29, 2016 at 12:39PM","IMAGE SOURCE: WESTERN DIGITAL.What: Shares of hard drive manufacturer Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) slumped on Friday following the company's fiscal third-quarter report. Western Digital missed analyst estimates on all fronts, and its guidance was well below expectations. At 11:40 a.m. ET, the stock was down about 14.5%.So what: Western Digital reported quarterly revenue of $2.82 billion, down 20.5% year over year and about $40 million shy of the average analyst estimate. Weak PC sales, enterprise workloads moving to the cloud, and declining prices for solid state drives are all pressuring Western Digital's core business. Western Digital announced last year that it was acquiring flash storage company SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK), a move that will diversify the company and lead to cost synergies.Non-GAAP EPS came in at $1.21, down from $1.87 in the prior-year period and $0.07 below analyst expectations. On a GAAP basis EPS was $0.32, down from $1.63. GAAP gross margin fell to 26.7% compared to 29.1% during the third quarter of last year.Western Digital expects revenue and earnings to continue to be weak during the fourth quarter. The company expects revenue of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, well below analyst expectations of $2.92 billion. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in a range of $1.00 to $1.10, also below analyst expectations of $1.34.Now what: With demand for hard drives in decline, Western Digital's acquisition of SanDisk makes strategic sense. Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan laid out the company's strategy going forward:Computer usage continues to shift from PCs to mobile devices and enterprise workloads are moving increasingly to cloud-based architectures. Our strategy to become a broad-based provider of media-agnostic storage solutions anticipates these and other trends. After we complete the acquisition of SanDisk, we will be better positioned to address and capitalize on these changes and opportunities, with the storage industry's broadest set of products, a rich technology portfolio, and an experienced team in both rotating magnetic and non-volatile memory."
5 Stocks With Bigger Dividends Than Merck & Co.,"Apr 25, 2016 at 4:25PM","FINDING THE BEST DIVIDEND STOCKS IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST PICKING THE BIGGEST YIELD. Pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK) is a solid dividend stock paying a 3% yield at recent prices with a recent history of steady increases. But there are plenty of stocks with bigger dividends than Merck. Is bigger better? Sometimes yes, but not always. We asked five of our top contributors to discuss a stock with a bigger dividend than Merck & Co., and to tell us why it's a better -- or not -- investment than Merck. Three gave us what they say are better stocks, one offered up a stock with a bigger payout that may not be a better investment, and one offered up a stock that may look like it has a bigger payout, but it really doesn't. Here's what they had to say. Long-term demand makes Boeing a better investmentDan Caplinger: It doesn't top Merck by much, but aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing (NYSE:BA) currently yields almost 3.5%, giving it an edge of about a tenth of a percentage point over Merck. However, the real draw for Boeing is the strength of the aerospace industry and the company's leadership role in it. The pharmaceutical industry has been under pressure for months as political campaigns have targeted the high cost of prescription drugs as a key plank on their agendas, and Congressional hearings have highlighted some of the more outrageous behavior among some of Merck's peers.Aerospace suffers from no such political considerations, and the fact that Boeing creates so many high-paying jobs in the U.S. is a point in its favor during the current presidential campaign. The stock recently took a hit when the SEC said it would look at the airplane maker's accounting practices, but you can't dispute the strong demand Boeing has seen from airlines and other buyers eager to make their fleets more efficient and cost-effective. Given how well Boeing has done even under times of global economic stress, its prospects could ramp up even further once countries across the globe see economic activity return to more normal levels. That makes Boeing a more compelling stock than Merck, in my view.Cyclical downturn makes Cat a great buyDaniel Miller: If you're an investor simply concerned about dividend yields, and you're looking for one bigger than Merck & Co, then look no further than a global machinery juggernaut Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). The company certainly faces headwinds from the slowing global economy, and Caterpillar generates the majority of its revenues abroad, so the negative impact from a strong dollar isn't helping matters. Management expects another 10% drop in revenues for the full year, and it will mark the first time in company history revenues have declined for four consecutive years.Unfortunately, these headwinds aren't going to let up on Caterpillar's business in 2016, but when it comes to dividends, few companies can match Caterpillar. Consider that Caterpillar has raised its quarterly dividend 83% since 2009, including last June's 10% raise. That June increase combined with the company completing $2.0 billion in stock repurchases during a rough 2015 proves its commitment to returning value to shareholders in good times and in bad -- and in looking at CEO Doug Oberhelman's comments below (from a press release), it seems that strategy is nearly set in stone: I am pleased to announce we are maintaining Caterpillar's quarterly dividend. Our balance sheet is strong, allowing us to reward stockholders through the cycles. Paying a dividend in times of business and economic uncertainty and throughout business cycles is a priority for use of our cash.Caterpillar has paid higher dividends to its shareholders for 22 consecutive years, and its cash dividend has more than doubled since 2007. Caterpillar's business faces near-term headwinds, that's for sure, but it's a company that will be around for the long haul. So will its dividend -- currently yielding above 4% -- for investors willing to wait for a global rebound.A sustainable energy dividend with growthMatt DiLallo: Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) not only has a 6.4% yield that makes Merck's dividend look tiny, but thanks to its growth pipeline, that payout should grow over time.Currently, Enterprise Products Partners has $6.6 billion in growth projects under construction that provide a very visible path toward distribution growth. In fact, those projects are expected to fuel 5.2% growth in the company's payout this year, with steady growth expected at least through 2018 based on the projects already under construction. Beyond that, the company is pursuing a number of additional organic growth projects that could keep its payout moving even higher.Bottom line, investors looking for a dividend that's bigger than Merck's should take a look at Enterprise Products Partners. It boasts a yield almost twice what Merck is yielding, and it has clear visibility to grow its payout at least through 2018.This big yield could be a value trapEvan Niu, CFA: Right now, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is boasting a seemingly impressive 4.6% dividend yield, which is over a full percentage point higher than Merck's. However, investors need to look before they leap on Western Digital, since that generous payout is largely a function of its declining share price. Shares have lost over half of their value over the past year, dramatically underperforming the broader S&P 500. The last thing that a dividend investor wants is to be attracted by a high yield, only to realize that they're catching a falling knife.Western Digital is in the process of trying to acquire SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK), a $19 billion deal that was announced late last year. The proposed acquisition continues to make its way through various regulatory approvals, following shareholder approval on both sides. But the greater concern is Western Digital's heavy debt load -- which is only about to get heavier.The hard-drive maker launched a $5.6 billion high-yield junk bond offering last month, which included secured and unsecured tranches. The debt offering is in part necessitated by Unisplendour's withdrawal of a deal to acquire a 15% stake in Western Digital, which would have helped bolster the balance sheet.If Western Digital and SanDisk close this deal, there's still a lot of uncertainty regarding how well the businesses will integrate, and if they'll be able to achieve the $500 million in annual cost-saving synergies that are expected. At the very least, interest payments on a heavy debt load also make it harder to sustain dividend payouts, particularly if there are cracks in other parts of the business. Western Digital may look like it has a tempting dividend, but I'd stay away.The dividend you expect may not be what you getJason Hall: One of my favorite businesses in the oil and gas industry is National-Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV), which has been supplying oil and gas producers with equipment, parts, and supplies for over a century. It's also a stock that may show up on your dividend screen, yielding more than 6% at recent prices. Except that it's not -- at least not after a recent announcement that its dividend would be reduced by 90%.The short version is that the company, which makes equipment used to drill and pump oil and natural gas, and for other parts of the oil and gas value chain, is making the move for two reasons: First, the oil and gas downturn could take a while yet to bounce back, and that means lower cash flows. So by cutting the dividend, the company is able to retain more of that cash as a measure of safety in hard times. Second, management is making sure the company is prepared to take advantage of the downturn if the right acquisition opportunities arise. In other words, a short-term cut could make for a better long-term investment. Just don't count on getting paid much in the meantime. If you invest in NOV based on its trailing yield of 6%, you'll be sorely disappointed, since future payouts will be 90% lower. "
SanDisk and Western Digital Investors Sign Off on Proposed Merger,"Mar 15, 2016 at 5:20PM","IMAGE SOURCE: WESTERN DIGITAL.What happened?Flash storage specialist SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) announced today that investors have overwhelmingly approved of its proposed merger with Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) announced late last year. Of the total votes that were cast, 98% were in favor of the deal. Meanwhile, Western Digital shareholders have also approved of the merger, with over 90% of votes in favor.All that's left is to obtain the final regulatory approvals in markets like China. The two companies have already received regulatory approvals in many other markets, including the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, among others. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.Does it matter?The proposed merger makes sense for a number of reasons since Western Digital expects to generate significant cost synergies through the deal. The company estimates that it can achieve full annual run-rate synergies of $500 million within 18 months of closing. The merger should be accretive to adjusted earnings per share within a year.While both companies are seeing growth decelerate in their core segments, merging and cutting costs can make that process more manageable while preserving profitability. The approvals have already been mostly priced in, so shares haven't moved much. But now comes the hard part of executing on the integration and realizing those synergies."
3 Reasons Micron Technology Stock Could Rise,"May 24, 2016 at 11:00AM","IMAGE SOURCE: MICRON TECHNOLOGY.Shares of memory-chip maker Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) have lost nearly 70% of their value since peaking in late 2014. Oversupply in the DRAM and NAND markets has ravaged the company's bottom line, turning once-record profits into losses. During Micron's latest quarter, the company reported a steep 30% year over year drop in revenue and a $97 million net loss.MU DATA BY YCHARTSThe worst for Micron may not be over, but there are a few reasons why the stock could rise over the next few years.Trouble in the hard-drive marketWhile DRAM accounts for the majority of Micron's revenue, NAND is an important business for the company as well. The NAND market has been rough for Micron recently, with the company's storage segment posting a loss in each of the past five quarters.One development that could help Micron's NAND business is the deteriorating state of the hard-drive market. Between Seagate, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Toshiba, hard-drive unit shipments plunged by 20% year over year during the first quarter. A weak PC market is one driving force, but the rapidly falling price of solid-state drives is also a factor. Western Digital recently closed on its acquisition of NAND manufacturer SanDisk, with the company recognizing that hard drives are unlikely to be a growth market going forward.Only a mid-teens percentage of Micron's NAND revenue came from solid-state drives during the company's latest quarter, with the bulk coming from memory cards and USB drives. But the SSD market is growing, with research company MarketsAndMarkets expecting total SSD sales to grow by 9.5% annually between 2016 and 2022. Unit sales should grow even faster as prices fall.One way to put an end to an oversupply situation is for demand to increase, and rising demand for SSDs could help put Micron's storage business back into the black. That would give investors a reason to push the stock higher.3D XPointMicron and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) jointly developed 3D XPoint, a new type of memory that is non-volatile like NAND but both faster and more durable. Intel is expected to release SSDs based on 3D XPoint sometime this year, and Micron will be free to launch its own products as well. The relationship between Intel and Micron is somewhat unclear, and Micron will apparently be competing directly with Intel. But if 3D XPoint memory is widely adopted, it could create an entirely new revenue stream for Micron.3D XPoint could either replace DRAM, NAND, or both, or it could act as a middle layer of memory between them. In data center applications, having a fast middle layer could make sense, allowing databases normally stored on NAND to be sped up significantly. 3D XPoint may also work well in mobile devices, potentially acting as both random-access memory and storage.Micron has previously stated that it doesn't expect meaningful revenue from 3D XPoint until 2017, but the company's expectations after that are sky high. CEO Mark Durcan suggested during the company's summer analyst conference that 3D XPoint could grow to be a $5 billion business by 2018, about half the size of Micron's DRAM business at the time. That outlook may be overly optimistic, but if 3D XPoint lives up to the hype, Micron's stock could soar.Hope for DRAMDRAM accounts for the majority of Micron's revenue, making the current oversupply situation plaguing the industry a major drain on revenue and profits. The PC market has so far shown no real sign of stabilizing, and the smartphone market suffered its first year-over-year unit shipment decline during the first quarter of 2016. Micron's mobile segment was hit particularly hard during the company's latest quarter, with revenue plummeting 40% year over year.The DRAM market may remain weak for a while, but there has been some good news recently. Micron rival SK Hynix forecasted strong DRAM shipment growth when it reported earnings in April, a possible sign that demand is picking up. Samsung, another DRAM rival, has reportedly slowed down supply growth, a move that led Bernstein to raise its price target on Micron to $11 per share and predict that supply tightness would manifest itself by the second half of 2017.Oversupply in the DRAM market will eventually be corrected, either by rising demand or falling supply. Micron's DRAM business will recover as a result, but it's impossible to predict exactly when this will happen. It may be this year, it may be next year, or it may take even longer. With the stock down so much over the past couple of years, any good news on the DRAM front could send Micron stock higher."
Upgrades: 3 Facts You Must Know About Micron Technology's Big Boost,"Feb 16, 2016 at 1:00PM","With the stock down 5% over the past two weeks, Goldman Sachs may have been early in recommending Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) shares two weeks ago -- but that doesn't mean Goldman was wrong. Indeed, more and analysts are starting to agree with Goldman Sachs: Micron stock has bottomed.The newsOn Tuesday, investment banker Mizuho Securities clambered aboard the Micron bandwagon. According to StreetInsider.com, Mizuho has just upgraded Micron shares to ""buy,"" and says the shares that cost just $10 and change today are really worth closer to $12.But is Mizuho right? Here are three facts you need to know to decide.Fact 1: Micron costs less than its book valueKey to Mizuho's buy thesis for Micron is the fact that Micron shares currently cost just 0.8 times the book value of the stock. (Currently, data from S&P Global Market Intelligence put the valuation at closer to 0.9 times book value of $11.89 per share -- but this is after the stock jumped in price in reaction to Mizuho's upgrade.)In any case, Mizuho says this is close to a ""trough valuation"" for the stock. What's more, the stock could look even cheaper once it has absorbed Inotera. With its erstwhile rival's assets incorporated into it, Micron's book value could rise by another $2 to $3, says Mizuho.That could put Micron's book value close to $15. At which point, even if investors continue to value Micron at only 0.8 times book, the stock should be worth $12. A price closer to Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) 1-times-book-valuation, on the other hand, would imply a price of $15 for Micron stock. And if investors were ever to price Micron closer to the 2.4 times book value at SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK), or the 4.9 times book value at Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) -- Micron stock could soar.Fact 2: There's a reason why Micron shares might go upWhat would it take to convince investors to pay so much more for Micron than they're willing to pay today? One possibility would be a buyout. Part of the reason that SanDisk shares cost so much, relative to their book value, is that Western Digital agreed to pay a big premium to buy SanDisk. At a market capitalization of less than $11 billion, Micron currently costs less than SanDisk, so a buyout doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility.But even absent a takeover, Mizuho sees thinks Micron could grow just fine on its own. According to the analyst, gross margins on DRAM memory appear to be improving -- and DRAM sales make up nearly 60% of Micron's business.Fact 3: Mizuho's not aloneMizuho isn't the only analyst singing Micron's praises today, either. Simultaneous with Mizuho's upgrade, Susquehanna Securities (which already had a positive rating on Micron stock) announced that although 2016 could continue to be tough for Micron, it sees a ""strong rebound"" in Micron's share price in 2017.According to Susquehanna, ""unit economics"" could begin improving toward the second half of this year, with gross margins improving in both Micron's DRAM and NAND memory businesses. Valuing the stock roughly at the same level as Western Digital's 1 times book value, Susquehanna predicts a $15 share price for Micron.And one more fact...All that being said, and as positive as these three analysts -- Goldman, Susquehanna, and now Mizuho, too -- are about the stock, there's still one more fact you need to consider before acting on today's upgrade:The analyst making the upgrade today is not good. In fact, it's kind of horrible.According to our data here at Motley Fool CAPS, where we've been tracking Mizuho's performance as an analyst for more than four years now, Mizuho Securities ranks in the bottom 20% of investors we track. Over the past four-plus years, fewer than 34% of Mizuho's stock recommendations have succeeded in outperforming the S&P 500 -- and on average, Mizuho's picks are underperforming the stock market by more than 13 percentage points per pick.What's more, when it comes to picking semiconductor stocks, Mizuho does even worse:Company  Mizuho Said:CAPS Says:Mizuho's Picks Beat (Lagged) S&P By:Altera CorpOutperform****4 pointsLattice SemiconductorOutperform***(35 points)Marvell TechnologyOutperform****(84 points)None of which has me feeling particularly enthusiastic about Mizuho's endorsement of Micron Technology stock today.A better way to make moneyGranted, Micron has the lowest P/B ratio of any of the memory-makers we've covered so far -- Micron, Seagate, Western Digital, and Western D's new prize, SanDisk. Granted, too, Micron's sub-6 valuation gives it the lowest P/E ratio of any stock on this list.But Micron also generates less free cash flow than any other stock on this list. Indeed, Global Market Intelligence puts Micron's FCF number at just $394 million -- a mere fraction of the $2.1 billion that Micron reported as its net income for the past 12 months. And according to Susquehanna's note today, Micron will probably need to up its capital spending as high as $5.3 billion to $5.8 billion this year, driving its free cash flow into negative territory.If you ask me, that prospect is likely to keep a lid on Micron shares at least through the balance of this year. I'm much more optimistic about the prospects for Seagate stock (trading at just 8.3 times free cash flow) or Western Digital, which costs less than 6 times FCF. Not only do those two offer better valuations than Micron does -- they also pay solid dividend yields...which Micron does not.Long story short: If you're going to be waiting around a year for the memory market to recover, you might as well get paid a dividend while you wait. Seagate and Western Digital will pay you that dividend.Micron won't.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

The 10 Worst Stocks in the Nasdaq in 2015,"Jan 17, 2016 at 8:03PM","IMAGE: BFISHADOW, FLICKR.The Nasdaq 100 Index did much better than the Dow and S&P 500, picking up gains of 8% in what was generally a flat year for the broader benchmarks. Yet even though many of the tech stocks that make up the biggest stocks on the Nasdaq stock exchange exploded higher, some sectors of the index held its performance back. Let's look at the 10 worst performers in the Nasdaq 100 in 2015 to see what they say about the weakest areas of the stock market right now.Stock2015 ReturnMicron Technology(59.6%)Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC)(44.3%)Viacom (NASDAQ:VIAB)(43.7%)Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX)(42.4%)Bed Bath & Beyond(36.7%)NetApp(34.7%)Yahoo!(34.2%)Whole Foods Market(32.7%)Qualcomm(30.6%)21st Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX)(28.6%)SOURCE: S&P CAPITAL IQ.Perhaps the most interesting thing about this list is that there aren't any energy companies on it. That's a reflection on the composition of the Nasdaq 100, as large players in the oil and gas industry have consistently chosen to list of the NYSE instead.Hard-driving declinesStill, you can see some broad themes play out on the list. First, the presence of hard-disk drive giants Western Digital and Seagate Technology point to the difficulties that the storage industry has had over the past year. Despite getting some respite from a brief uptick in PC demand in 2014, both companies have seen demand shift away from traditional hard-disk drive storage toward solid-state solutions.Western Digital has attempted to bolster its position in that space by buying flash-expert SanDisk, but intense competition among flash-drive players has also put a crimp in profits there. Seagate, meanwhile, has focused on returning capital to shareholders through a strong dividend as a massive repurchase program. Neither strategy has inspired confidence in their stocks, but Seagate and Western Digital trade at attractive valuations as long as you think their businesses won't fall apart entirely.Eventually, both companies will likely come up with more modern storage technology solutions for its clients. But 2015's performance shows that Western Digital and Seagate Technology have further to go before they get there.Media falloutThe other major theme among losing stocks in the Nasdaq was the difficulty in the media industry. Both Viacom and 21st Century Fox have extensive exposure to the cable television industry, and cord-cutting among cable subscribers has led to a decline in viewership for their respective networks. Competition from streaming-video companies producing their own content has also presented increasing challenges for the media companies, and Fox has had to deal with increased prices for showing valuable sports content that have posed long-term threats to profitability if viewership trends don't reverse course and support rising payments to major professional sports organizations.Fox can point to potential success on the film side of its business as a hedge against the cable industry's woes, but Viacom is arguably more dependent on traditional cable programming. Major cable networks hope that they can find ways to circumvent cable companies entirely, going direct to viewers by offering access to programming through home broadband and mobile devices. Yet unless they can find a way to sustain advertising rates in a shift toward mobile -- something that tech companies have struggled with -- then Fox and Viacom could see further pressure in the years to come.Even though the Nasdaq 100 outperformed most market indexes last year, there were pockets of weakness that demand attention. By looking at prevailing trends, you can work toward outperforming the indexes by avoiding tough sectors like these and focusing instead on the companies with the best future prospects."
Here's How Netflix Inc. Can Take On Censors Around the World,"Jan 22, 2016 at 3:21PM","PHOTO: NETFLIX.Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) recently added 130 new territories to its global service footprint. The streaming-video service now covers every country allowed by American embargo policies, except for the politically difficult Chinese market. This week, Netflix started running into some not-terribly-surprising political resistance in some additional regions, including Kenya and Indonesia.Is the sudden expansion falling apart? I don't think so. Some fallout should simply be expected, and Netflix is likely to sort out its differences with most countries in the end. These early issues, and the Indonesian situation, in particular, serve as useful testing grounds for the entire campaign.What's the problem?The national censorship board of Indonesia is calling on the government to block Netflix services. The Indonesian catalog allegedly includes a few titles that the censoring body had blocked from showing in local theaters, and Netflix has apparently not filed for all of the appropriate licenses and permissions needed.""We reminded [Netflix that] if they don't want to apply for licenses, then don't enter [Indonesia],"" said Indonesian censor body Chairman Yani Basuki, according to a report in local news outlet Tempo .The Kenyan challenge is not very different from the Indonesian issue. Local news site Standard Digital reports that content regulators had a look at the Netflix catalog, quickly deciding that this stuff would be bad for the people of Kenya. The country does not yet have any specific laws to govern Internet-based video services, but censorship still applies in any medium.""This is great contravention of laws governing film and broadcast content distribution in Kenya, which has put at risk our moral values and national security,"" Kenya Film Classification Board hairman Jackson Kosgei reportedly said. ""The medium of transmission notwithstanding, all content whether local or foreign, must be regulated.""The specific issues are always the same: ""Some of the content rated 13 presents classifiable elements of nudity, promotion of irresponsible sexual behavior, inappropriate language and drug abuse,"" Kosgei said.Why here? Why now?I'm sure that more countries will raise similar concerns in the coming weeks and months, and that Netflix must have prepared for this unavoidable challenge.Yes, Kenya and Indonesia are huge in many ways. Kenya holds 44 million citizens, and Indonesia is home to 250 million people. In fact, Indonesia boasts the fourth-largest population on the planet, trailing only China, India, and the United States.Netflix decided to start slowly in these territories. According to an ambitious report from Finder.com counting the titles in 184 different Netflix markets, both Indonesia and Kenya rank among the 25 smallest launch catalogs.With less than 200 TV shows and only 463 movies to consider, the Kenyan censors could make fairly short work of their initial review. Indonesian content raters had even less material to handle.The censorship bodies in Tanzania and Iraq reportedly have about twice as many TV series to wade through, besides rating nearly 2,000 movies. Simply put, the Kenyan and Indonesian censors could issue comprehensive warnings very quickly because there wasn't much work to do. Other nations may have even more-restrictive rules and tougher enforcement to boot, but they probably haven't gotten around to Pulp Fiction and Sense8 yet.How Netflix will handle Kenya and IndonesiaI fully expect Netflix to fight back and/or adjust to the local regulations in Indonesia. In fact, this is a must-win battle.According to a Worldbank report from 2013, Indonesia is among the most difficult places on earth to do business. So Netflix should not be surprised to see an immediate government pushback.At the same time, only 15% of Indonesian households have access to landline broadband connections, and 12% have smartphone broadband services at the very low end of what you'd call ""broadband."" But according to the same Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) research that shows these disappointingly low broadband penetration figures, 71% of the same 250 million citizens should have at least 20-megabit landlines by 2019. Mobile broadband should reach 52% of Indonesians at that point.If those predictions are in the right ballpark -- and I see no reason to disagree, given the rapid strengthening of Indonesia's economy -- then Netflix would be silly to leave that market unexplored. In just a few years, it will be obvious to everyone that Indonesia is a valuable market for network-intensive Internet products. The time to build a presence and start acquiring mind share is now.RELIABLE BROADBAND CONNECTIONS ARE HARD TO COME BY IN KENYA.Kenya should be a lower priority, but it still isn't a market to be ignored. The sixth-largest nation in Africa, Kenya is also sharply divided between an affluent minority and a struggling general population. According to Cisco's studies, these are very early days of broadband access in this country, and Netflix-style services will play to a very small audience in Kenya for years to come.The Kenyan government does plan to provide 5-megabit broadband to the entire nation -- but that's the endcap to a very long-term plan known as ""Vision 2030."" Kenya currently has less than 1 million broadband households, 95% of them relying on mobile connections. Sure, it never hurts to get started early, but Kenya won't be a significant broadband market anytime soon.How Netflix can win in JakartaWhat can Netflix do to stay involved in problematic markets like Indonesia? The first step would be to secure a ton of properly redacted material.For Netflix original shows, this won't be hard. Set the editing crews to ""inoffensive,"" and let them loose on the content that already belongs to Netflix.It's true that Sense8 would make very little sense -- no pun intended -- without its psychedelic and sexual references. Narcos without violence? Just show a TV test pattern throughout the entire season, why don't you. But this loss of quality has not stopped censors from taking their hacksaws to all kinds of material around the world, and a crippled Daredevil is still better than none at all.Third-party shows and films would be trickier, and might require a few amended license agreements. Some studios might prefer to back away from this potential PR firestorm, even if they get a smaller annual check from Netflix's licensing department. But others would be happy to provide redacted versions, or at least let Netflix do its own censorship work.Meanwhile, Netflix must send negotiators, international law experts, and high-ranking company executives to talk to the Indonesians. If there's paperwork to do, then get it done. Show them how hard you're working on a catalog that conforms to local standards of morality, and promise to keep future titles on a short leash.The end result would be a collection of de-fanged content, scrubbed chemically clean of materials offensive to Indonesian consumers (or more correctly, to Indonesian censors). This sub-catalog could then be put to good use in other territories with similar issues, like most of the Middle East, and many Asian countries with iron-fisted governments.What's next?Netflix is new to these particular issues, because its earlier territories in Western Europe, Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Americas generally don't impose strict censorship on media. But here we go, and Netflix must adapt or fail.Making it work in Indonesia should be well worth the effort as the local economy grows and modernizes. A scrubbed content collection created as a side effect should prove useful in many other markets, and could even be the silver bullet that someday lets Netflix enter China.Kenya will happen, if only as a logical extension of that Indonesian content cleanup. But don't expect CEO Reed Hastings to take a plane to Nairobi over this early challenge. He's much more urgently needed in Jakarta, after all.10 stocks we like better than NetflixWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is Big Lots a Big Buy?,"Apr 22, 2016 at 6:35PM","Shares of Big Lots (NYSE:BIG) have been on a white-hot run of late, up about 30% over the past three months. That easily outpaces the S&P 500, as well as discount retail peers like Dollar General and Wal-Mart. Signs of a sales turnaround and optimism over finally entering the digital age are fueling the happy times for Big Lots shareholders, but how long can they last? IMAGE SOURCE: YCHARTS.Turnaround taleOperationally, Big Lots shareholders have reason to be optimistic. In Q4, same-store sales increased 70 basis points -- representing the eighth straight quarter of growth -- while gross margin inched up to 40.9%, which was 10 basis points higher than the year-ago period. Operating margin also came in at a solid 9.5%, suggesting that management isn't just deep-discounting their way to improved comps.Big Lots' turnaround initiatives, which include the introduction of a furniture leasing program, a change to its merchandising mix, and the continued right-sizing of its store count, have all seemed to help sales without weighing too heavily on profitability. No small feat, indeed. Management even upped the quarterly dividend 11% to $0.21 per share, showing plenty of confidence in the company's growth trajectory going forward. For Q1, Big Lots expects a same-store sales increase in the low single-digit range.When you combine that upbeat near-term outlook with the long overdue launch of an e-commerce platform (which should help boost longer-range sales), it's no surprise that Mr. Market is big on Big Lots' prospects. As a Foolish value investor, however, I worry that he might be a little too excited.IMAGE SOURCE: BIG LOTSToo much credit?Without a clearly differentiated offering, it's tough to see how Big Lots keeps the momentum up in such a notoriously competitive space. After all, as fellow Fool Demitrios Kalogeropoulos notes, same-store sales declined for 10 consecutive quarters prior to the recent string of increases. While aggressive merchandise changes are certainly having a positive effect, the novelty might fade over time with fickle customers. And since the gains related to Big Lots' furniture leasing program are heavily credit-driven, they may not be all that sustainable, either. In other words, there's a decent chance that the company's recent sales improvement is somewhat temporary in nature.On the digital side, Big Lots itself doesn't expect too big of an initial boost: CEO David Campisi says it only sees the website generating $20 million in sales this year, which pales in comparison to a top line of $5.2 billion. As Demitrios points out, Big Lots has its work cut out in the e-commerce game against rivals with a multiyear head start. The platform probably won't be profitable for several quarters, and may even cannibalize business from customers who enjoy Big Lots' in-store experience.Waiting for a discountWith all that said, it wouldn't shock me if management keeps the sales momentum up for several more quarters. Given the recent-run up and P/E in the high teens, however, Big Lots shares don't seem to be factoring in enough risk that it doesn't. For reference, you can pick up dividend stalwart Wal-Mart at a P/E of 15, or pay up a bit for the faster-growing Dollar General at a P/E of 20. With year-over-year comparisons only about to get tougher for Big Lots in upcoming quarters, a more attractive entry point may be ahead. "

How Chevron Plans to Use UAVs and AI to Deliver Big Profits,"Apr 24, 2016 at 1:26PM","IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.COMArtificial intelligence and UAVs are two emerging technologies with big potential. Due to the continual breakthroughs in semiconductors, natural language processing, and other technologies, some scientists think that AI could eclipse human intelligence as soon as 2029. Given the improvements in weight reduction and battery technology, many investors believe UAVs could do everything from powering Internet connections to delivering products quickly over the next decade too.Given the two technologies' potential, it isn't surprising that Chevron (NYSE: CVX) has big plans for artificial intelligence and UAV technology for its future. Let's explore in more detail.How Chevron is putting AI to workChevron is currently using AI to identify new well locations and stimulation candidates in California. By using AI software to analyze the company's large collection of historical well performance data, the company is drilling in better locations and has seen production rise 30% over conventional methods. Chevron is also using predictive models to analyze the performance of thousands of pieces of rotating equipment to detect failures before they occur. By catching the problems before they become serious, Chevron has avoided unplanned shutdowns and has lowered its repair expenses. The increased production and lower repair costs have translated to more profit per well.Although artificial intelligence doesn't play a big part in Chevron's operations right now, AI software is constantly improving. As technology advances, AI will help Chevron find new well locations in other projects outside California and lower finding costs. It will catch problems outside of rotating equipment and increase productivity. It will reduce non-productive time and increase return on investment. Overall, analysts believe artificial intelligence and digital technologies will unlock trillions of dollars of productivity gains over the next decade in the industrial sector, with the oil and gas sector being one of the prime beneficiaries. How Chevron plans to use UAVsLike AI, UAVs currently play a small but efficient role in Chevron's operations.In Europe, Chevron has used unmanned aerial vehicles to visually inspect flare tips on the Alba and Captain platforms in the North Sea. Using UAVs reduces the safety risk to the contractors and employees who used to do the inspections hundreds of feet above the water. Now the contractors and employees can do the inspections safely behind a monitor screen. Because of the advancements in camera and imaging technology, Chevron can perform the same quality of inspection without putting its employees at risk. In offshore Western Australia, Chevron has used UAVs to monitor turtle tracks and nests around its billion-dollar Wheatstone Project to gather necessary environmental compliance information. Using UAVs has been a more effective and non-obtrusive method than using humans to collect the information.As regulation concerning unmanned aerial vehicles in different nations advance to allow for more usage, Chevron will use UAVs for more purposes and in more locations. Currently, regulation in the United States is very strict and requires UAVs to remain in the line of sight for operators for safety purposes. The regulations make inspecting pipelines with UAVs difficult, given that the operators of the UAVs would be miles away. However, Chevron has received an exemption from some of those regulations and plans to use UAVs to do aerial surveying, mapping, and detecting potential operational threats in the near future. Chevron hopes to eventually use UAVs to monitor its pipeline, production, and shipping operations. Using UAVs to gather data will save Chevron tens of millions in asset monitoring and surveying costs and will help the company catch more problems before they occur. Using AI and UAVs fits with the Chevron WayA big reason Chevron has been one of the leaders in realizing the most upstream earnings per barrel before the crude crash was that it used the most efficient technologies to optimize profits. Given Chevron's commitment to artificial intelligence and UAVs, that focus on efficiency will continue, and the company's AI and UAV efforts could give Chevron a competitive advantage versus smaller companies. Because Chevron is larger, the company can spread the costs through more of its operations, thus lowering the cost of AI research per barrel. The company could also get bigger discounts from third party UAV contractors.One of the tangible impacts investors can watch for as an indicator of AI/UAV success is Chevron's unscheduled downtime for refineries and other projects. As AI and UAV monitoring improves, unscheduled downtime will decline as AI software catches problems before they occur. Less unscheduled downtime, increased productivity, and lower finding costs should also lead to higher returns on capital when controlling for project cost and crude prices. "
3 Trends That Will Shape the Movie Industry in 2016,"Mar 14, 2016 at 6:15PM","SOURCE: FERNANDO DE SOUSA VIA FLICKRThe movie industry is going through some major changes, and for the most part, the overall climate is favorable for companies, including Disney (NYSE:DIS), Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA). The record global box office haul of $38.2 billion in 2015 set big expectations for this year, and it looks like 2016 is on track to deliver once again thanks to these developments.Growth in China and other markets is changing the gameThe past decade has seen no shortage of doomsday scenarios put forth for the box office, but the threats from piracy and online streaming services have yet to play out in global ticket sales. That's partially because worldwide performance has masked domestic box office totals that have been relatively stagnant over the past five years, with increases in ticket prices making up for a decline in ticket volume. It does seem probable that a wider range of entertainment alternatives is contributing to the lack of domestic box office growth.Meanwhile, growth in China and India is exploding, with the former country expected to become the world's biggest film market in 2017. The Chinese box office totaled more than $1 billion in February, surpassing American ticket sales of roughly $800 million. Last year, the Chinese box office grew nearly 50%.The rapid expansion of this vast market and somewhat unusual barriers to entry are funneling Hollywood resources into overseas production. In fact, China currently allows 34 foreign releases to screen in the country on an annual basis, while co-productions and movies produced exclusively in China face fewer restrictions. As such, the major film studios are forming new partnerships with Chinese companies and building production studios in the country to gain better access to the world's fastest-growing film market. Big 2015 hits like Furious 7 and Jurassic World were the result of co-productions with Chinese companies, and an increasing number of films will be made under similar conditions and tailored to better fit a global audience.Chinese companies are also buying up entertainment assets. In 2012, the Dalian Wanda Group acquired AMC, and the theater chain is now angling to buy rival Carmike for $1.1 billion. The Dalian Wanda group also recently purchased a controlling stake in Legendary Pictures, a move that puts it in very good shape for global film distribution.The domestic market is still central to the movie industry, but most of the growth is happening internationally, and this year will continue to see film totals lifted by rising tides in China and other emerging markets.Movie universes are expandingThe expanded film universe format popularized by comic book adaptations has become one of the core content strategies of the biggest film studios, and 2016 could be the biggest year on record for superheroes and other expanded universes. This year will see the release of six big budget superhero movies, more than ever before, and the unfolding worlds of franchises such as Star Wars show that planning for spin-offs and tie-ins is becoming essential to tent pole releases.Fox's recently released Deadpool is a spin-off of the X-Men universe and the first blockbuster hit of the year. May will see the release of the company's superhero ensemble X-Men: Apocalypse. Fox was also planning on releasing Gambit in early October, but it has removed the picture from its 2016 slate and announced two untitled Marvel films for 2017.Time Warner's comic book movie universe finally kicks into high gear this year with Batman v. Superman and Suicide Squad representing the first two entries in the 11 DC Cinematic Universe films planned through 2020. Meanwhile, Disney has Captain America: Civil War launching in May, which will introduce characters including Black Panther and Spider-Man into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This year will also see the release of MCU-film Doctor Strange and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the first of many spin-offs planned in the galaxy far, far away. Sony will attempt to use Spider-Man's appearance in Disney films to build a successful foundation for its own expanded franchise built around its most valuable comic book license. The company has a film based on the rebooted webslinger on track for release next year. Sony is also reportedly looking to its upcoming Ghostbusters reboot as a launching pad for connected spin-off films and has confirmed a crossover between its Men in Black and Jump Street properties. Even Comcast's Mummy reboot starts filming this year and will kick off the company's monster characters universe with a 2017 launch. Blockbusters benefiting from premium formats, while smaller pictures find life online In addition to international growth and one of the biggest movie lineups ever, a strong showing for premium formats will also work to make the total box office haul in 2016 the largest on record. Of the 34 American-produced films allowed to screen in China annually, 14 spots are set aside for movies that release in premium formats, creating extra incentive to debut major franchise pictures this way and driving average ticket prices up.The increasing focus on big budget franchise films also looks to benefit premium formats, and the stacked release lineup should boost premium sales, particularly in Western Europe and Asian territories, where growth has been strongest.As movie chains aim to distinguish their entertainment offerings through premium screens, smaller pictures are having a harder time standing out at multiplexes but finding ample new avenues through online distribution. Small to mid-budget movies are reaching large audiences on platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime. These companies are pushing into original content themselves and, when combined with other favorable film industry trends, mean there is more money in the film industry than ever.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

The Secret to Domino's Pizza Inc.'s Success,"Apr 21, 2016 at 4:31PM","On a list of top restaurant stocks, most investors would probably be unlikely to name Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ), but the delivery chain has quietly returned an eye-popping 5,000% since the recession. While many of its fast-food peers have struggled to fend off the rise of fast-casual competition, the pizza-delivery leader bucked the trend by expanding internationally, improving operations, and leveraging its brand through franchising. The following chart shows the strong earnings and soaring stock price in recent years.DPZ DATA BY YCHARTS.That turnaround didn't happen by accident. Here are the keys to Domino's surprising comeback.Improving the productDomino's is ubiquitous today, with 12,500 locations in 80 countries, but with falling profits, the company and the menu often maligned, it decided to relaunch the brand in late 2009. The company reformulated its pizza recipe and has changed most of its menu since then, introducing new items such as Handmade Pan Pizza and Specialty Chicken.  Customers noticed the improvement in the pizza quality, and in a memorable ad campaign, Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle admitted that customer criticisms, including that the old pizza tasted like cardboard, were valid. He encouraged disappointed customers to give Domino's another chance, lending credibility to the company's new recipe.Domino's isn't the only restaurant chain to revitalize sales by reformulating its product. Under the auspices of activist investors, Darden Restaurants enhanced many of the company's recipes by doing things as simple as adding salt to the pasta. The results have been impressive, with steadily improving same-store sales and a resounding gain in the stock price.Enhancing operations with technologyAs technology has proliferated further into daily life, Domino's Pizza has used innovations such as digital ordering to make the user experience easier and more convenient. Today, 50% of sales come through online platforms like the Domino's app and website.  The company launched online ordering in 2008, and took operations in-house in 2010, introducing mobile apps and later a voice-ordering application. The company also created the Domino's Tracker, which allows customers to follow their pizza from the oven to their doorstep.A new rewards program started last year complements the company's digital platform. Domino's also has a new point-of-sale system, called PULSE, that has added operational efficiencies. PULSE is now in use in almost all domestic stores and 60% of international locations.Adding new stores With the momentum from the menu reboot in 2009 and 2010, Domino's began rapidly adding new stores, opening nearly 3,000 new locations in the past four years, the vast majority of which were overseas. Though over the past decade quick-service pizza has been a slow-growing market in the U.S., Domino's sees opportunities internationally. The company believes the international pizza delivery market is underdeveloped and lacks strong competition.Domino's now has 7,330 stores outside of the U.S. The company's presence is particularly strong in India, the U.K., and Mexico which all have more than 500 locations. Domino's international stores are operated through master franchisee agreements in which one franchise controls a large territory and often sub-franchises to other operators. One such franchisee, Domino's Pizza Enterprises, controls 1,561 restaurants in six countries. The franchise model also benefits the company as franchisees are a guaranteed customer of its supply chain, the source of a majority of the company's revenue, along with royalties. Will the winning streak continue?Domino's Pizza stock jumped again in its most recent earnings report as adjusted earnings per share increased 26% and domestic same-store sales grew 12% for the year. The key sales metric has improved steadily as Domino's has invested in product and technology improvements. Same-store sales growth has been better than 5% in each of the last three years, and increased each time. That kind of track record is rare in the restaurant industry and points toward continued growth for the pizza chain. International same-store sales have improved for a remarkable 22 years in a row, another sign of the brand's strength.The market has caught onto the company's steady growth, pumping the stock's P/E ratio up to 40. However, with ample room for expansion abroad and impressive same-store sales growth momentum, Domino's stock could easily continue to buck the odds and keep moving higher. 10 stocks we like better than Domino's PizzaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Borgata Is Biggest in Atlantic City, but Maybe Not for Much Longer","May 26, 2016 at 11:09AM","THE BORGATA IS THE BRIGHTEST STAR IN ATLANTIC CITY, BUT WHEN THINGS MOVE TO THE INTERNET, THAT MAY NO LONGER BE THE CASE AS POKERSTARS RAMPS UP ITS ONLINE GAMING PRESENCE WITH RESORTS. IMAGE SOURCE: BORGATA.The Borgata may be the biggest bet in Atlantic City, but it may not stay on top for long, at least when it comes online betting. The March launch of Amaya's (NASDAQ:AYA) PokerStars online platform indicates the Borgata may soon be playing second fiddle.High rollersTotal Atlantic City gaming revenues rose 8% in April to $215 million, thanks to the PokerStars debut, which helped boost the city's Internet gaming win 33.8% to almost $17 million. But there may also have been something of a halo effect in play as all gaming category activities were higher for the month including slot machines (up 5%) and table games (10% higher).Where Atlantic City Internet gamblers have an advantage over their Nevada counterparts is the eastern seaboard's gambling mecca allows Internet versions of a number of casino games while its western counterpart only permits poker.And the Borgata, which is jointly owned by Boyd Gaming (NYSE:BYD) and MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), handily beat the competition across the board. Its total gaming win for April was just a few dollars under $60 million, which represented a 4.2% increase from the year-ago figure. Its bricks-and-mortar casino raked in almost $56 million, nearly double its next closest rival Harrah's, which had $29 million.But more ominous might be the tale of the tape in Internet gaming win where Borgata, which holds the licenses for both BorgataPoker.com and PartyPoker.com, saw its take actually fall 0.2% in the month to just $3.98 million, while Resorts Casino Hotel surged into second place with its Resorts Digital division earning an Internet gaming win of $3.4 million.Although its total casino win in April was $13.9 million, the smallest take of any of the city's eight gambling halls, it also represented a 14% year-over-year increase for Resorts, one of the best performances of the month. Expect at least the Internet win to keep growing, but it will have to prove its casino games are worth a return trip.POKERSTARS DEBUT AT THE CASINO OF ITS LAND-BASED PARTNER RESORTS HERALDS A NEW LEVEL ON INTERNET GAMING THAT COULD LAUNCH THE GAMBLING HOUSE TO THE FOREFRONT OF THE ATLANTIC CITY STAGE. IMAGE SOURCE: POKERSTARS.A wide netOnline gambling in New Jersey is, of course, a relatively new phenomenon, only legalized in the state in 2013, but one that while extending a lifeline to the casino industry, which was faltering after Pennsylvania, New York, and Massachusetts all started or expanded gambling in their states, has created a labyrinthine process to gain licensing to operate.Just ask PokerStars, which signed a deal with Resorts to allow it back in the U.S. in 2013 after being charged two years prior with bank fraud, money laundering, and illegal gambling operations. It settled with the Justice Dept. in 2012, but wasn't granted an operating license for online gambling until last October. It finally had a soft launch of its site in March and then went live soon thereafter and it's already bearing fruit.But PokerStars can't seem to shake the cloud that follows it. Amaya CEO David Baazov was recently charged with insider trading by Canadian securities authorities. Of course, Resorts knows a thing or two about the online gaming market as the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority, which manages not only Resorts' Atlantic City property but successfully operates Mohegan Sun in Connecticut and Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs in Pennsylvania./ Resorts online offerings include ResortsCasino.com and MoheganSunCasino.com, both of which feature a wide selection of casino, slot, and table games.Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) was another big winner in April with its interactive gaming division notching the biggest gain of the month with a 30% increase in Internet gaming win. It has been the casino's one bright spot and is why the ailing gambling house is mulling over the decision to sell the online platform for an estimated $4 billion.Only the beginningOnline gambling has been a success in New Jersey since its introduction and bricks-and-mortar casino operators like Tropicana and Golden Nugget have performed admirably. The latter's addition of Betfair, however, has kept its Internet gaming win in the top tier in the state. The Trop has turned in a workmanlike performance as well.Still, now that PokerStars is up and running in New Jersey, it is the one to watch, and after just one month in operation, it could be the Borgata has the most to lose.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

Why Western Digital Corp. Took a Fall Today,"Jul 29, 2016 at 1:16PM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.What: Shares of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) fell as much as 11.9% on Friday, following the release of results for the fourth quarter of 2016. The report itself was impressive, but Western Digital's forward guidance failed to inspire investors.So what: In the fourth quarter, Western Digital saw sales rising 9.5% year over year to $3.5 billion. Adjusted earnings fell from $1.51 per share to $0.94 per share. Analysts would have settled for earnings of $0.71 per share on sales near $3.45 billion.Midway through the quarter, Western Digital closed the $19 billion acquisition of solid-state storage specialist SanDisk. As separate companies, Western Digital and SanDisk amassed total sales of $4.4 billion in the year-ago quarter. Then again, Western Digital's revenue fell 20% year over year in the third quarter. The puzzle pieces do fit together.Looking ahead, management aimed for first-quarter revenue of roughly $4.45 billion and non-GAAP earnings near $0.88 per share. The sales target sits above the average analyst estimate, but Wall Street was expecting a juicier bottom line.Now what: Western Digital headed into this report with plenty of momentum, as share prices had gained 31% after April's third-quarter report. Share prices took a dive in late June, reacting to the Brexit drama. The stock rebounded quickly, but I managed to start a Western Digital position while it was on fire sale.That investment is still up by 10%, even after Friday's sharp plunge. Some analysts see this as profit-taking; I would call it another buy-in window. Western Digital has armed itself for the next era of storage technology, and the stock can be bought for a mere 9.3 times trailing earnings.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Sell Western Digital Stock After a 17% Drop? Read This First,"Aug 4, 2016 at 11:31AM","Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) stock is having a miserable month. After shooting skyward early in July, Western Digital stock plummeted 12% in response to Q4 earnings last week -- and hasn't looked back (or up) since.Despite reporting 9.5% sales gains last week, pro forma earnings at the hard disk drive-maker plummeted 38%. Management added insult to injury when it warned investors that the current quarter will look much like the last. Revenue may come in ahead of guidance, but profits will once more fall short -- which did not much please investors.At last report, Western Digital stock had given up 17% of its market cap since earnings came out, and according to one analyst, the selling isn't done yet. This morning, Goldman Sachs announced that even after its 17% price cut, Western Digital stock still isn't cheap enough to own. Instead, the megabanker advised its clients to sell Western Digital.Here are three things you need to know.GOLDMAN SACHS COUNTS MORE ZEROS THAN ONES IN WESTERN DIGITAL STOCK'S FUTURE. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.1. The first step (down) was a doozy. The next could be just as big.According to Goldman, the 17% drop that Western Digital stock suffered last week was only the beginning of the bad news. In a new report covered on StreetInsider.com just yesterday, Western Digital's next leg down could be just as steep as the last one -- and Western Digital stock could fall as far as 16% lower, to crash-land at $38 a share.Why?2. NAND is a four-letter word.Goldman points the finger directly at ""NAND margin risk,"" warning that across the semiconductor industry, companies are growing capital spending by as much as 50% this year, setting themselves up for systemic oversupply in 2017. Additionally, new developments such as 3D NAND are shaking up the industry and making ordinary NAND obsolete.""WD is behind Samsung in 3D NAND,"" warns Goldman, and to fix this, is ""trying to ramp quickly, which we believe creates yield risk,"" in the analyst's estimation. At the same time, China is rushing to compete on NAND memory, which is contributing both to the capital expenditures explosion, and to the risk of global oversupply -- which will hurt profit margins across the board.3. How bad will this get?Despite its disappointing guidance, Western Digital may benefit in the short term from what Goldman calls ""likely tight near-term HDD and NAND supply/demand."" But longer term, Goldman believes the real damage is yet to come.The analyst sees Western Digital earning 37% less profit than most analysts on the Street expect -- just $3.45 per share -- and then earning $3 a share in fiscal year 2017. (Note that Western Digital operates on a calendar where the years end mid-calendar. ""Fiscal year"" 2017, therefore, is already under way, and in fact began back on July 1.)Timing may be everythingSo is Goldman Sachs right to tell investors to sell Western Digital stock today? The answer may depend on your time frame. According to the analyst, Western Digital will earn $3 this fiscal year, and at today's share price of just under $45, that works out to a P/E ratio of 15 on the stock.Farther out, however, Goldman Sachs -- despite telling you to sell today -- sees Western Digital's earnings rising to $4.55 in fiscal 2018, then $5 a share in fiscal 2019. Translation: In just over two years' time, Western Digital could report profits nearly 5 times the $1.06 that it has earned over the past 12 months, and so it sells for a P/E ratio of just 9 times those projected FY 2019 earnings.Call me crazy, but if it truly is able to grow so fast from this year's projected low, then that doesn't sound like such a very high price to pay for Western Digital stock. And with the stock paying you a beefy 4.3% dividend yield in the meantime, it may just pay to be patient -- and not sell Western Digital stock at all.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Forget Micron Technology, Inc: These 2 Stocks Are Better Buys","Sep 15, 2016 at 1:21PM","Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has rallied more than 20% this year on the belief that tighter DRAM and NAND (flash memory) supplies could boost memory prices across the market. But despite those positive catalysts, Micron sales and earnings growth remain weak. Revenue fell 25% year over year last quarter, compared to a 30% decline in the previous quarter and a 3% decline in the prior-year quarter.IMAGE SOURCE: MICRON.In the NAND market, Micron faces tough competition from larger rivals like Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), Toshiba, and Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) SanDisk. In the mobile DRAM market, it lags behind Samsung and SK Hynix. Analysts expect Micron's sales to fall 24% sales this year, compared to a 1% decline last year.Micron posted a non-GAAP net loss of $0.08 per share last quarter, compared to a loss of $0.05 in the previous quarter and a profit of $0.54 a year earlier. In addition to tough competition, Micron's bottom line has been dragged down by market oversupply, pricing pressures, and challenges from integrating the manufacturing processes of its combined Elpida and Micron fabs. Analysts expect Micron's annual earnings to merely break even at $0.00 this year, compared to a profit of $2.47 per share in 2015. Micron also isn't cheap at 49 times earnings, which is more than four times the average P/E of 11 for the memory chips industry.In my opinion, there are safer ways to play the rebound in memory prices than Micron. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Western Digital, for example, both offer better diversification with exposure to the same markets.Intel's a more diversified computing playIntel left the DRAM market in 1985 amid intense competition, but started jointly developing NAND chips with Micron in 2006. That partnership formed the foundation of Intel's non-volatile memory business, which generated 4% of its sales last quarter. Together, the two companies developed new memory technologies like 3D NAND and 3DXPoint, the latter of which could offer ""1,000 times"" the performance of current-gen NAND chips.A 3DXPOINT WAFER. IMAGE SOURCE: MICRON.Intel frequently highlights non-volatile memory alongside the Data Center, Internet of Things, and Programmable Solutions businesses as ways to diversify its top line beyond PCs. However, the ongoing decline in memory prices caused Intel's non-volatile memory chip revenue to fall 20% annually last quarter. The unit also posted an operating loss of $224 million, down from an operating profit of $92 million in the prior year quarter.Those gloomy figures mirror Micron's results, but Intel generates most of its revenue and operating income from its dominant Client Computing (PC and mobile solutions) and Data Center groups. The ongoing slowdown in PC sales caused Intel's Client Computing revenue to fall 3% annually last quarter, but that decline was partly offset by 5% growth in Data Center revenues.Rising memory prices won't boost Intel's sales as much as Micron's, but Intel offers investors more balanced growth than Micron. Analysts currently expect Intel's revenue to rise 4% this year while earnings are expected to improve 7%. Intel also trades at just 18 times earnings, compared to the industry average of 22 for broad line semiconductor companies, and it pays a forward dividend yield of 2.9% -- while Micron has never paid a dividend.Western Digital's a more diversified NAND playWestern Digital stock slid 14% this year due to sluggish sales of older HDDs (hard disk drives), which were being cannibalized by NAND-based SSDs (solid state drives). However, WD made a bold move and purchased SanDisk for $19 billion earlier this year.The purchase instantly made it the third largest NAND maker in the world with a 15% market share, according to DRAMeXchange's first quarter figures. Samsung leads the market with a 35% share, while Toshiba and Micron respectively control 22% and 13% of the market. While the massive acquisition will take time  to fully integrate, analysts expect the move to reduce WD's dependence on HDDs and get its sales growth back on track with 2% top line growth next year.SANDISK'S FUSION IOMEMORY FLASH DEVICES (L) AND ENTERPRISE SSDS (R). IMAGE SOURCE: SANDISK.WD's main HDD rival, Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), hasn't made a meaningful purchase in the NAND space yet. Instead, it formed a multi-year strategic alliance with Micron to expand its presence in enterprise SSDs. That plan hasn't impressed analysts, who still expect Seagate's sales to slide 3% next year.To fund the SanDisk acquisition, WD suspended its buybacks, thus reducing its EPS growth. However, the company is still expected to post 44% earnings growth next year (as SanDisk becomes earnings accretive), which makes its forward P/E of 8 look very cheap. Moreover, WD pays a forward dividend yield of 3.9%, which is still easily supported by its FCF payout ratio of 33% over the past 12 months. Like Intel, WD is a cheap dividend play instead of an aggressive bet on memory prices rising, but its SanDisk unit will still benefit from that turnaround when it happens.The bottom lineMicron would benefit much more than Intel or WD from rising memory prices, but it could also lose a lot more if that recovery is delayed. So with the market near all-time highs, I personally prefer buying cheap income-generating investments like Intel and WD over speculative turnaround plays like Micron."
"3 Tech Stocks That Turned $10,000 Into $200,000","Nov 12, 2016 at 10:11AM","If you have $10,000 to invest, most financial advisors will probably tell you to put the cash in an index fund which tracks the overall market. That's because it's considered too risky to put all your savings in a single stock, but buying three to five stocks might not create a well-diversified portfolio.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.But if you have $10,000 that you can afford to lose, you might consider investing in a few riskier, high-growth plays which could crush the S&P 500 over the long run. Let's look at three tech stocks that turned $10,000 into $200,000 or more in just over a decade -- Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM).AlphabetAlphabet, the company formerly known as Google, went public in 2004 for $85 per share. Your $10,000 would have been enough to buy 117 shares. The company then did a share spin-off in 2014 that had a similar impact as a 2-for-1 split.You would then have 117 shares of Google's Class A (voting) stock and 117 shares of the new Class C (non-voting) shares. At today's prices, those 234 shares of Class A and C shares would be worth about $182,000. When both classes hit historic highs in late October, your investment would have been worth about $193,000.Staying invested in Google required confidence in its ability to evolve from a high-growth search engine with a triple-digit P/E ratio into a diversified tech giant. It gradually accomplished this by expanding its ecosystem with Maps, YouTube, Drive, Chrome, Android, and other platforms. By offering those cloud-based apps, services, and operating systems for free, Google created the perfect funnel to gather customer data for its targeted ads. That move turned Google into the 800-pound gorilla of internet ads.Western DigitalHard-drive maker Western Digital, which went public in 1978, generally isn't known as a high-growth stock. But if you had spent $10,000 to buy 4,098 shares of WD in December 2000 during the nadir of the dot-com crash, you would be sitting on over $235,000 today. Moreover, your investment would be paying you nearly $8,200 in dividends every year.IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.Western Digital bounced back from the dot-com crash because it was the still the market leader in hard disk drives (HDDs), and the growth of the PC market and expansion of data centers ensured that orders would keep coming in. But in recent years, the HDD market was hit hard by a slowdown in PC sales, weaker enterprise spending, and the rise of flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs).SSDs are pricier, but they're faster, smaller, more power-efficient, and less prone to damage than HDDs. This makes them a much more popular choice for high-end tablets, 2-in-1 devices, and ultrabooks. To stay relevant, WD acquired flash memory and SSD maker SanDisk earlier this year in a $16 billion deal. WD's 55% rebound over the past six months suggests that investors believe that warming PC sales and the SanDisk acquisition could breathe fresh life into this aging tech giant.SalesforceSalesforce, the market leader in cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) solutions, went public in 2004 for $11 per share. Your $10,000 would have been enough to buy 909 shares. After undergoing a 4-for-1 split in 2013, those 3,636 shares would be worth over $275,000 today.Salesforce built its entire business on CRM solutions that were easily scalable as subscription-based cloud services. Its first-mover's advantage in that market helped it claim 19.7% of the global CRM market in 2015, according to Gartner. That put it well ahead of rivals such as SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, and Adobe. Salesforce also posted the highest year-over-year market share gain of those five market leaders.Salesforce has a strong record of double-digit sales growth, but its bottom line growth is weaker. The company is consistently profitable on a non-GAAP basis, but its GAAP earnings only occasionally stay in the black on a quarterly basis. Looking ahead, Salesforce also faces tough questions about its high valuations (234 times earnings and 7 times sales), as well as new CRM challenges presented by Microsoft's purchase of LinkedIn.The key takeawayInvesting in Alphabet, Western Digital, and Salesforce at the right time took a lot of guts, patience, and luck. While it should be very tough to find the next stock that could turn $10,000 into over $200,000, investors should keep an eye out for promising plays that could generate massive returns in just one or two decades.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Key Takeaways From Broadcom Ltd.'s Earnings Call,"Jun 8, 2016 at 11:30AM","IMAGE SOURCE: BROADCOM. Shares of Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), a fairly broad-based semiconductor company, reached fresh 52-week highs after the company reported strong earnings results and forward guidance. So far, things are looking good for the company, which was recently formed from the combination of Broadcom Corporation and Avago Technologies.On the conference call accompanying the earnings results, management offered a lot of insight into the business. Here are some items from the call that should be of particular interest to potential and current investors in the company.Broadband and switching offsetting wireless and hard disk drive weaknessAccording to CEO Hock Tan, ""demand for hard disk drives and smartphones was weak this quarter."" Broadcom's wireless business depends significantly on sales of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone family of products. Demand for iPhones is known to be weak, and it doesn't help suppliers like Broadcom that the iDevice maker is trying to bring down iPhone channel inventory levels (meaning that suppliers will likely under-ship end demand for iPhones).The relatively weak demand for hard disk drives, as evidenced in the quarterly results from hard disk drive makers Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), also doesn't help Avago's business. The company's enterprise storage sales were down 23% quarter-over-quarter as a result of both the drop in the total addressable market for hard disk drives as well as ""seasonal weakness in the enterprise server storage connectivity market.""Nevertheless, Tan says that the company was able to deliver revenue ""in line with expectation"" as a result of ""strong product cycles from switching and broadband in a wide segment.""Wireless rebound in the coming quarterAlthough weak iPhone demand weighed down the company's wireless business in the most recent quarter (offset somewhat by ""increasing shipments to a large Asian handset OEM""), Tan appears optimistic about the company's wireless segment in the coming quarter.""Moving onto [the] third quarter, we're expecting a very different picture for our wireless segment and expect strong sequential revenue growth in the mid-20% range,"" Tan said.The executive went on to add that this growth will be driven by the ""start of a ramp from a large North American smartphone customer as they transition to their next generation platform enhanced by a substantial increase in Classic Avago's RF content in this new handset.""This is no doubt driven by an improvement in the cellular modem capabilities of the new phone.In addition to an increase in RF content in the new iPhone, Tan says that ""wireless connectivity content will also increase in this new handset."" In other words, expect Apple to advertise a boost in Wi-Fi speeds and capabilities in the next iPhone as well.In a statement intended to preemptively shoot down analyst concerns about the long-term viability of Broadcom's traditional wireless connectivity business (which have come up in prior calls), Tan made the following comment:We anticipate our wireless connectivity business to continue to drive significant innovation for mobile Wi-Fi and Bluetooth applications and expect this product line to be a very key long-term contributor to our wireless segment.Enterprise storage bottoming out this quarterTan says that the company expects further declines in the total addressable market for hard disk drives (negative for Seagate/Western Digital), which will drive Broadcom's enterprise storage revenues down by ""low single digits sequentially.""The good news, though, is that the company expects the current quarter to represent the ""trough for enterprise storage revenue this fiscal year."" Additionally, Tan expects Broadcom to ""continue to gain share in [its] hard disk drive business.""10 stocks we like better than Broadcom LtdWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

10 Highest Dividend Stocks in Tech,"Aug 20, 2016 at 9:08AM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Income investors broadly aim to buy above-average dividends that boast market-beating stock-price growth, as well. That's a tall order, because high-dividend payouts often come shackled to shares that have declined sharply -- often due to underlying business difficulties in stodgy, slow-moving industries. To combat these natural difficulties, the technology sector just might offer the right mix of growth, dynamism, and dividend yield to be worthy of investor's attention. Below, we'll look at the top-dividend stocks in the technology sector with an eye toward finding the ones that could provide that elusive mix of hefty cash returns and capital appreciation.Highest dividend-paying technology stocksStockDividend yieldPayout ratioFrontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR)8.7%N/AWestern Digital (NASDAQ:WDC)4.5%56%AT&T (NYSE:T)4.4%82%Verizon (NYSE:VZ)4.2%64%HP (NYSE:HPQ)3.5%25%IBM (NYSE:IBM)3.5%43%Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)3.4%57%Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO)3.4%44%Xerox (NYSE:XRX)3.2%74%Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)3%48%SOURCE:YAHOO FINANCE.Sustainable dividendA high dividend won't do you any good if it isn't also growing over time, so we can screen out dividends that aren't well covered by current earnings and cash flow. In Frontier's case, for example, the communications giant booked a net loss in its last fiscal year and for the first quarter of 2016.Sure, free cash flow is about twice the $125 million it pays out each quarter in dividends. However, Frontier's large debt load and costly expansion plans means that there are more-important priorities than boosting an already-generous payout.INTC CASH FROM OPERATIONS (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS.Consider IBM as a stronger dividend-growth candidate. Its $1.3 billion quarterly payout was less than half of its (substantial) earnings last quarter, and just one-third of its operating cash flow. Big Blue's debt level, meanwhile, is less than twice its cash on hand. The consistently improving cash production has helped the dividend double since 2010, even as the payout ratio remains below 50% of earnings .Solid market outlookIntel stands out in this list as a dividend tech giant with solid growth prospects. Despite weakness in the PC market, Intel's management sees an acceleration in sales gains this year thanks to healthy demand in its data center, programmable solutions, and Internet of Things divisions. Profitability is also running ahead of plan thanks to falling production costs.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Unfortunately, restructuring expenses will continue to pinch short-term profits. Yet Intel appears set to emerge from its transition in fine shape to take advantage of major tech trends like cloud computing and big data.Contrast that outlook with hard-drive giant Western Digital, whose stock has slumped by 40% in the last year as sales volume and profitability dropped. Like Frontier, WDC is hoping a major acquisition will help it right the ship, but sustainable dividend growth won't be possible until sales and earnings recover.Finding a good valueThanks to their relatively slow growth and spotty recent financial performance, nearly all of these tech stocks can be purchased at a discount to the broader stock market. Newly formed HP is the cheapest of the group at nine times forward earnings, while Qualcomm weighs in as the priciest, at 16 times next-year's profits. Investors are paying about 19 times forward earnings, meanwhile, for the S&P 500. All of the above stocks also pay an annual yield that's at least 50% higher than the S&P's current 2%. Of course, the valuation and income gaps alone don't make these dividend stocks screaming buys. But they do suggest that income investors could find some solid long-term bets among mature dividend tech giants right now.With that in mind, I'm most interested in Intel at today's prices. The chip titan's cash flow and profits seem to have stabilized and are primed for steady growth even if the PC market stays weak, which means its dividend has room to improve from its already market-thumping 3% yield. Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip. Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner and his brother, Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner, just revealed two brand new stock recommendations. Together, they've tripled the stock market's return over the last 13 years.* And while timing isn't everything, the history of Tom and David's stock picks shows that it pays to get in early on their ideas.Click here to be among the first people to hear about David and Tom's newest stock recommendations.*Stock Advisor returns as of April 2, 2018"
The 10 Top Nasdaq 100 Dividend Stocks: Do Any Belong in Your Portfolio?,"Aug 19, 2016 at 2:02PM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Historically, the Nasdaq 100 hasn't been well-known as a habitat for dividend stocks. The tech-heavy exchange was full of companies that tended to reinvest their profits into growth projects rather than returning capital to shareholders. But in recent years, more Nasdaq-listed companies have are looking at dividends as a critical part of their total return success.Below, we examine the 10 top-yielding dividend stocks in the Nasdaq 100 today, with an eye toward identifying whether any of them give you the combination of income and growth prospects that make them ideal candidates for your portfolio.The Nasdaq 100's High Yield WinnersHere are the 10 highest-yielding stocks among the Nasdaq 100 as of Aug. 18:CompanyDividend YieldSeagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX)8%Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD)5.4%Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT)4.5%Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC)4.4%Viacom (NASDAQ:VIA) (NASDAQ:VIAB)3.7%Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)3.4%Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)3.4%Maxim Integrated Products (NASDAQ:MXIM)3.2%Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX)3.1%Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)3%DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE.The most obvious thing about this chart is the huge lead that Seagate Technology has over its Nasdaq 100 brethren. The maker of hard-disk drives and other data storage products has long been on many investors' danger lists in terms of expectations for a dividend cut in the future, especially because the company has been under considerable pressure as the mobile revolution reduces the importance of PCs, with their traditional reliance on hard drives for storage. In addition, Seagate's free cash flow has been less than its dividend payments in the first two quarters of 2016.Ordinarily, such a high yield would indeed be a danger sign. However, Seagate has actually seen its yield drop from double-digit percentages earlier this year as the stock recovered somewhat from lows below $19 a share, and optimism about the company's prospects are the primary cause. Investors were pleased by Seagate's recent restructuring announcements, and even though the company expects to reduce production of hard drives, it is looking at focusing more on high-end enterprise applications, which carry higher margins. In addition, efforts to expand its exposure to flash memory and solid-state drives could represent growth opportunities for Seagate as well. Rival Western Digital has also seen some positive movement in its share price, and although its yield also remains high, rays of hope have emerged for the data storage industry.Flying lowerAnother trend you can see in this list of stocks is that it includes many former high-flyers that have come upon tough times. In the semiconductor industry, for instance, Qualcomm and Intel are both going through the pains of adapting to changing conditions in the PC and mobile chip businesses. Cisco has seen similar changes afflict its networking hardware unit. Yet an recently improving tech sector has lifted those stocks and sent their yields lower compared to where they were early in 2016.Among the stocks above, however, there are some interesting growth candidates. Vodafone has struggled due to competitive pressure in the European wireless telecom market, but the decline in the British pound could bolster its profits due to favorable foreign-exchange impacts and help send the stock higher. Moreover, expansion efforts in emerging markets in Africa, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region could also add to growth. Even though Vodafone no longer has its exposure to the U.S. market after selling its minority stake in Verizon Wireless, the British telecom arguably has even better prospects because of the potential in many underserved emerging markets.At the same time, Paychex has exposure to the strong U.S. economy. By offering payroll services to employers, especially small and mid-sized businesses, Paychex keeps its finger on the pulse of American employment trends. As job growth has increased and the economy has recovered from the financial crisis, Paychex has been able to sustaining its own growth. With the U.S. still outpacing its peers overseas economically, Paychex offers not only an attractive yield but also plenty of possibilities for rising share prices.For dividend investors looking at the Nasdaq as a source of stock ideas, the index's traditional aversion to dividends has almost entirely disappeared. By focusing on the stocks with the best growth prospects, however, you'll ensure that you not only get paid while you wait for companies to reach their full potential but also enjoy share-price appreciation when they succeed in their growth goals. Seagate offers that mix for those who are willing to assume the execution risk of the storage-device maker's turnaround efforts, and both Vodafone and Paychex also have opportunities to expand their respective businesses to give dividend investors even more of what they want in the months and years ahead."
Here's How to Find the Best Dividend Stocks,"Dec 14, 2016 at 12:00PM","Dividend investors often prioritize a stock's yield above all other factors. While a stock's yield is certainly important, it's also important to examine five other key factors -- payout ratios, earnings growth, free cash flow growth, valuations, and historical dividend hikes.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Payout ratiosA stock's payout ratio is the percentage of a company's earnings which are allocated to dividend payments. The lower this percentage is, the more room a company has to grow its dividend. If the payout ratio remains above 100% for several quarters, the dividend is likely unsustainable.For example, hard drive maker Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) has a forward dividend yield of 6.4%, but it also has a whopping payout ratio of 200%. Its bigger rival, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), pays a lower forward yield of 3%, but has a much more sustainable payout ratio of 56%. Income investors who only chase yield would probably buy Seagate instead of Western Digital, but they could be disappointed by a big dividend cut in the future.Earnings growthInvestors should also avoid income stocks with declining earnings. For example, camera maker Canon (NYSE:CAJ) pays a forward yield of 4.7% and has a payout ratio of 86%. However, its earnings are also expected to fall 25% this year and another 5% next year due to the commoditization of the camera market.Those declines will inflate Canon's payout ratio and increase the likelihood of a dividend cut. Moreover, Canon's poor earnings growth is already reflected in the stock's 34% decline over the past five years. Therefore, investing in a declining stock with sliding earnings for a higher yield isn't a sound strategy.Free cash flow growthEarnings-based payout ratios can be distorted by buybacks, follow-on offerings, or all sorts of bottom line adjustments. As a result, some payout ratios don't accurately reflect the sustainability of certain dividends.That's why investors should also check a company's free cash flow (FCF), which is a company's operating cash flow minus its capital expenditures. By comparing a company's total dividend payments over the past year to its FCF, we can calculate the FCF payout ratio -- which more accurately reflects a dividend's sustainability.If we check Seagate again, we'll notice that it only paid out 61% of its FCF as dividends over the past 12 months. This means that Seagate can keep supporting its dividend for now, although the payments exceed its per-share profits every quarter. Companies sometimes do this if they believe that reducing the dividend would cause a big sell-off. But if a company's earnings and FCF payout ratios both exceed 100%, the dividend will likely be cut.ValuationsThe low interest rate environment has made dividend stalwarts more attractive than bonds over the past few years. But that will change as interest rates rise, boosting the yields on high-grade bonds to levels which match those of income-generating stocks. Since bonds are fixed income investments with guaranteed returns, they will become the preferred vehicle of wealth preservation for income investors.As a result, dividend stocks which have rallied to historically high prices and valuations could be aggressively sold off as rates rise. Tobacco giant Altria (NYSE:MO), for example, currently trades at 25 times earnings compared to the industry average of 21 for big tobacco companies. Its yield of 3.5%, while solid, also hovers near a historical low:SOURCE: YCHARTSThis means that Altria, and other dividend stalwarts with high valuations and low yields, will be hit hard by interest rate hikes next year. Investors should avoid those types of dividend stocks and stick with ones that trade at discounts to their industry peers.Dividend hikesLastly, some stocks have high yields but don't raise their dividends annually. A company doesn't need to be a ""dividend aristocrat"" that has raised its payout for over 25 years, but a strong record of dividend hikes indicates that it's dedicated to rewarding long-term, buy-and-hold investors with a consistent cut of its profits.The key takeawayI personally own a lot of dividend stocks, and I've made plenty of mistakes chasing high-yield stocks in the past. But I found that by looking beyond yield, it was easier to find safer income stocks with sustainable yields, consistent dividend hikes, low valuations, and decent profit growth. Therefore, income investors should run their potential dividend plays through these tests to see if they're worthy long-term buys.10 stocks we like better than Altria GroupWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What's Up With Seagate Technology PLC Falling 33% in 2016?,"Jun 27, 2016 at 12:20PM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.What: Shares of hard-drive maker Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) have fallen 33% so far in 2016, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The company's core market is changing quickly, and chief rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is better prepared for the new business reality.So what: Solid-state drives, or SSDs, offer much greater read and write speeds than traditional magnetic disk devices. The old-school hard drives still have their uses, because they offer more storage for the buck and larger sizes in general. But those advantages are eroding, as SSD specialists keep pushing street prices down and device sizes up.These days, you can get a 10-terabyte Seagate hard drive for the modest price of $0.08 per gigabyte. (One terabyte is 1,024 gigabytes.) The largest SSD units stop at roughly 4 terabytes, priced at approximately $0.48 per gigabyte. And the SSD prices are getting downright competitive for consumer-grade devices, where a 250-gigabyte drive costs just $0.36 per GB. In that category, best-selling magnetic drives are going for about $0.05 per gigabyte.Under these circumstances, the total market for traditional hard drives is shrinking fast. Seagate shipped 39.2 million drives in the recently reported third quarter. That's 29% below the 55.2 million drives it shipped two years earlier.STX DATA BY YCHARTS.Now what: The time to find a foothold in the rising SSD market is now, before memory chips get cheap enough to erase the last advantages of owning a magnetic disk model. Western Digital addressed this vital need by buying SSD specialist SanDisk, giving the company an established SSD brand with years of experience in that market. Seagate is still looking for a response to that brilliant move, and coming up short.The company is flailing. In Seagate's latest earnings call, management acknowledged that SSD alternatives are eating into many of its most important markets. But they never addressed an SSD strategy for Seagate itself, beyond lowering production volumes in the areas hardest hit by the market change.Seagate shares have now fallen 65% from the highs of late 2014, giving me little reason to believe in a rebound any time soon. This company needs to surprise us all with a flashy (pun intended) SSD-oriented buyout or the unveiling of an in-house product line for the new age. For now, there are no signs of anything like that."
5 Best Performing Stocks in September,"Oct 3, 2016 at 1:30PM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.In September 2016, two classes of stocks outperformed everything else by a wide margin. Partly thanks to surging oil prices, three of the S&P 500's top five performers that month came from the energy industry. The other two tickers in that elite quintet were hard-drive builders, lifted by a rebounding market for PC systems.Let's have a closer look at September's best performers.APA DATA BY YCHARTSIn a series of jumps and drops, the price of crude oil rose more than 8% last month. The tide of global political pressure turned as the OPEC consortium agreed to cut production by 1.5 million barrels per day. A rising tide lifts all boats, and oil stocks were generally very kind to their owners in September. For major independent oil producer Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), this was the main story behind September's rising share prices.But wait -- there's more.On top of that strong foundation, Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA) announced the discovery of a newly discovered 3 billion-barrel reserve of shale oil. Apache's stock rose 7% on that finding alone.And for Spectra Energy, oil prices hardly even mattered. Here, the big boost arrived when fellow energy pipeline operator Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) announced an all-stock merger with Spectra to create a titan of the energy midstream industry.After several months of plunging oil prices, the energy sector is thirsty for a serious rebound. Many smaller companies have found merger partners to stave off a bitter end -- or gone out of business altogether. Weak balance sheets are being put to the ultimate test here, and the sector is consolidating in response.Signs of life in PCsMeanwhile, in the computer hardware corner, rumors of the PC's death turned out to be greatly exaggerated.Storage giant Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) got the ball rolling in early September. That's when the company raised its first-quarter guidance, reflecting two positive trends: the integration with recently acquired peer SanDisk that's running ahead of schedule -- and a PC industry that's showing signs of recovery.That announcement lifted Western Digital shares 13% higher overnight, and the stock has held steady at this elevated level.Arch rival Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) took a smaller step up that day but followed up with another surge as private-equity firm ValueAct Capital invested more than $400 million in the company. ValueAct is now one of Seagate's largest shareholders, holding 4% of the company's shares. The firm explained its investment with a desire to take advantage of ""attractive long-term secular trends"" around Seagate's business.Other technology businesses and independent market watchers have only amplified the message found in Western Digital's tea leaves. The PC market seems is not quite dead yet, and it seems ready to stick around for a while.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"3 Reasons Micron Technology, Inc. Stock Could Fall","Dec 20, 2016 at 1:00PM","Memory chipmaker Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has rallied more than 40% this year -- which might seem odd for a company which has posted six straight quarters of annual revenue declines. Most of that rally was fueled by the belief that global demand for memory chips will rise and cause prices to keep rising.IMAGE SOURCE: MICRON.However, those bullish expectations might have caused Micron's stock to get ahead of itself. Let's take a look at three major headwinds which could blow the stock off course next year.1. The supply crunch easesMicron's sales have been falling due to an oversupply of DRAM and NAND chips. However, bullish interest in the stock was sparked by several reports that DRAM and NAND supplies were tightening up again.Back in August, HP (NYSE:HPQ) CEO Dion Weisler claimed that the company's PC business was facing shortages of memory chips. In October, TrendForce forecast that DRAM prices would hit a two-year high this year due to a supply crunch. The research firm also estimated that the global supply of PC DRAM chips was declining, as memory chipmakers expanded into the adjacent markets of mobile devices and data centers.In the NAND market, DRAMeXchange recently estimated that prices of SSD and eMMC devices will rise over 10% sequentially in the first quarter of 2017, due to a shortage of NAND chips attributed to strong smartphone shipments in China, stable SSD growth, and the increase in the average NAND flash density in eMMC (embedded multimedia controller) and eMCP (embedded multi-chip package) devices.However, Micron is still vulnerable to sluggish PC sales (which have declined annually for eight straight quarters), peaking smartphone sales, and competition from bigger rivals in the DRAM and NAND markets. These factors could all cause supplies to rise and prices to fall again -- which means that analysts' expectations for 31% sales growth next year could be too optimistic.2. The competition heats upMicron is the fourth largest NAND maker in the world after Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), Toshiba, and Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) SanDisk. It's also the third largest mobile DRAM maker after Samsung and SK Hynix.Competing against Samsung is tough, since the South Korean tech giant can use its massive foundry to reduce production prices and other non-semiconductor business segments to offset lower memory chip prices. If we look at Micron's gross and operating margins over the past five years, we can see how price declines and competition hurt its bottom line growth.SOURCE: YCHARTSThis chart suggests that Micron's margins could fall even further before bottoming out. Furthermore, Micron's efforts to expand its moat -- including its development of faster 3D NAND and 3DXpoint tech with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and its acquisitions of smaller memory chip makers like Inotera Memories -- will cause expenses to rise and weigh down earnings growth. Therefore, Wall Street's forecast for Micron's non-GAAP earnings to surge from $0.06 per share last year to $1.63 per share this year could also be too bullish.3. The looming Chinese threatMeanwhile, China wants to build its own domestic semiconductor market for two reasons -- concerns about the security of U.S. tech, and the need to boost its own economic growth.That's why China's state-backed conglomerate Tsinghua Group tried to buy Micron and a 15% stake in Western Digital earlier this year. However, both deals were eventually terminated due to U.S. security concerns. Nonetheless, the Chinese government and Tsinghua are still aggressively developing their own semiconductors across multiple industries -- which means that it could eventually flood the market with cheap memory chips and bury smaller players like Micron.During a recent event in Taipei promoting the merger of Micron and Inotera, Micron CEO Mark Durcan warned that if China spends ""the money that they say they are capable of spending, they can create oversupply."" He noted that the move was ""absolutely"" a concern for the entire industry.But will Micron fall next year?These three challenges could be tough for Micron to address, but I also don't think the stock will fall off a cliff next year. DRAM and NAND prices should continue rising unless sales of PC and mobile devices plummet. Its new 3D NAND and 3DXpoint tech should help it keep pace with its bigger rivals, and the distant Chinese threat shouldn't hurt its results over the next few quarters. Nonetheless, Micron remains a fairly risky play and should only be bought by investors who fully understand the cyclical nature of the DRAM and NAND markets.10 stocks we like better than Micron TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Can Seagate's Dividend Even Survive?,"Aug 19, 2016 at 8:16AM","IMAGE SOURCE: SEAGATE.It's hard to find a technology stock with a dividend more generous than Seagate's (NASDAQ:STX). The maker of traditional hard-drives currently pays its investors around $0.63 per quarter per share. Trading near $32, Seagate yields almost 8%. Dividend payouts vary from company to company and from industry to industry, but by nearly any standard, Seagate's yield is unusually high. It may seem attractive, but would-be investors should approach with caution.If the market was confident in the sustainability of Seagate's dividend, investors would likely buy the stock en masse, pushing its yield down to a more pedestrian 3% to 5% (chief rival Western Digital, for example, yields just over 4%). The fact that Seagate's yield is so high suggests many investors view the company skeptically, anticipating a reduction in its payout at some point in the near future.However, if Seagate can sustain its dividend, it could reward investors with a steady stream of sizable payments. Let's take a closer look at the prospects for Seagate's dividend.A little high, but manageableFrom the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2014, Seagate's dividend yield remained consistent at around 3%. But early in 2015, Seagate's business began to deteriorate. Over the last 18 months, Seagate's share price has crumbled, and its dividend yield has surged. On two of the company's recent earnings calls, management was asked explicitly about the possibility of a dividend reduction.STX DIVIDEND YIELD (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTSDuring the company's January earnings call, CEO Steve Luczo expressed complete confidence in the dividend going forward. ""Our cash flow relative to our dividend payment is not a concern for us at all,"" he said.But in April, Seagate turned in a disastrous third-quarter report. Unsurprisingly, Luczo's subsequent remarks were far more tempered. ""We would certainly like to keep the dividend level where it is,"" he said. ""[But] obviously, these...pay-out ratios [are high].""CFO Dave Mosley remarked that Seagate's dividend was ""manageable"" but was careful to note that the company's board of directors would make the final determination. ""We think [the dividend] is well manageable, albeit at the higher end of those levels of a pay-out ratio, and obviously up to the board of directors,"" he said.Seagate's payout ratio looks unsustainableIn each of its last three quarters, Seagate paid out $188 million worth of dividends. Operating cash flow, however, has varied, and has been trending down. In the second quarter, Seagate generated $382 million of operating cash flow. That fell to $205 million in the third quarter, and $269 million last quarter. In other words, Seagate has spent almost two-thirds of its operating cash flow on dividend payments since the beginning of the year.Looking at net income, the comparison is even worse. Seagate has recorded a total net income of $301 million in 2016. On a trailing 12-month basis, Seagate's payout ratio is an astounding 293.1%. A year ago, Seagate had $2.5 billion of cash on its balance sheet -- that fell to just $1.13 billion at the end of last quarter.Seagate's management undertook a number of cost-cutting initiatives this summer aimed at reducing its expenses. ""Overall restructuring activities are proceeding as planned, and we expect the financial benefit of these actions will begin to have a positive impact [next quarter],"" Morton said on the company's August earnings call.But over the last four quarters, the drop in Seagate's business has been swift, and for shareholders, alarming. In its fiscal year 2015, Seagate generated $2.65 billion of cash from its operations; that dropped to just $1.68 billion in 2016. At the same time, annual sales fell from $13.74 billion to $11.16 billion.Seagate's business remains tied to the market for traditional PCs, and its core hard-drives are under pressure from increasingly affordable flash-based storage. If Seagate's business continues to deteriorate, a sizable dividend cut seems likely.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks to Capitalize on Millennial Tastes,"Sep 20, 2016 at 9:33AM","MILLENNIALS ARE COMING INTO THEIR OWN. INVEST ACCORDINGLY. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Millennials reached a huge milestone earlier in 2016, when they passed their baby boomer parents to become the most populous generation in America. Not only is this the most educated and tech-savvy generation, but it's also coming into its own financially and is set to be a huge driving force behind the American economy for decades to come. Smart investors recognize this for the opportunity it is, too. Millennials, like any prior generation, have unique tastes and preferences, and some of the best investments in the coming years are likely to be companies millennials love.Looking for a stock that's set to win big on the back of millennials? Keep reading for three that our contributors think are right in the millennial wheelhouse. Surf the e-commerce wave Brian Feroldi: Millennials tend to be far more tech-savvy than older generations, so perhaps it should come as no surprise to learn that they love to buy products online. That fact bodes well for the future prospects of digital payment leader PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL).MILLENNIALS CONDUCT COMMERCE AS VIRTUALLY AS POSSIBLE. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. PayPal has been gaining market share in the electronic payment space ever since it was founded in the late 90s. Despite its age, the company's platform continues to grow rapidly. Total payment volumes grew on a currency-neutral basis by 29% last quarter, which was faster than the growth of e-commerce sales in general. In addition, the company has made it easy to use its services on mobile devices, which has proven to be a huge hit with consumers. Roughly 28% of the company's total payment volume took place on a mobile device last quarter, and I'd wager that number is bound to rise given the incredible worldwide popularity of smartphones and tablets.There are also ways for this company to grow beyond its core PayPal brand. PayPal's management team has a nice history of making smart acquisitions of other fast-growing payment companies. In 2013, PayPal acquired a payment processing start-up called Braintree, which brought the incredibly popular digital transfer money app Venmo under its umbrella. Last year, it purchased the online money transfer service Xoom, which is rapidly displacing Western Union and Moneygram in the global remittances market.When you add Venmo and Xoom to the fact that millennials' purchasing power is bound to expand over time, PayPal looks well positioned for decades of growth. That makes this stock a great way to profit from the rise of the millennial generation.The fast-casual revolutionIMAGE SOURCE: SHAKE SHACK.Tim Green: According to a 2015 survey by Morgan Stanley, fast-casual restaurants are the preferred restaurant format for millennials. Millennials account for 51% of fast-casual customers but made up just 31% of the people surveyed. This doesn't mean fast food and full-service restaurants are doomed, but it does mean fast-casual chains have a major opportunity in front of them. While Chipotle is the creme de la creme of the fast-casual world, its recent food safety scandal has scared a significant chunk of its customers away. For investors looking to capitalize on the fast-casual trend among millennials, a smaller chain with a huge runway for growth is the best bet. Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) fits the bill.The high-end burger chain is still small, operating just 51 restaurants at the end of the most recent quarter, with another 44 locations licensed. The company's food is expensive, limiting its ultimate size, but it has a cult following and generates an exceptional level of per-store sales. Each restaurant produces over $100,000 in sales per week, a number that, while sure to drop as the company expands, is impressive nonetheless.Shake Shack stock is not cheap, even after cratering soon after its IPO. But with room to grow the restaurant count into the hundreds, and with millennials' preference for fast-casual restaurants, Shake Shack has ""growth stock"" written all over it.Housing and sustainabilityJason Hall: Millennials have been slower to buy homes than prior generations, but they are still buying, if later in life. One company that's primed to benefit from millennials becoming homeowners is Trex Company, Inc. (NYSE:TREX).Trex is already the leader in the alternative wood decking product category, commanding more than 40% of the market in 2015. But when it comes to market share of the total addressable market, there's a huge opportunity to grow:IMAGE SOURCE: TREX PRESENTATION. Trex sales make up less than 10% of the total board-feet of decking sold in North America each year. So, as much as the company has grown its share of alternative wood decking sold each year, Trex is still a mere sliver of the total decking pie. Millennials are likely to help grow that slice much bigger.According to a 2015 Nielsen survey, millennials put more importance on environmental stewardship than prior generations, with 75% saying they're willing to pay more for products that offer better sustainability. That falls right in the wheelhouse of what Trex does, with its award-winning decking, which is made of recycled wood and polyethylene plastic. Factor in a relatively healthy housing market -- and one millennials are becoming bigger participants in -- and Trex could benefit from the growth of millennial homeowners for decades to come, particularly as they look for more environmentally sustainable ways to improve their homes. 10 stocks we like better than TrexWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Why AK Steel, Ashford Hospitality Prime, and Dave & Buster's Entertainment Are Jumping Today","Jun 8, 2016 at 12:55PM","IMAGE SOURCE: DAVE & BUSTER'S.The stock market continued its streak of modest gains on Wednesday, as the S&P 500 now stands within 1% of its all-time record high. Investors are waiting impatiently for U.S. central bankers to make their next move clear about interest rates, and the financial markets are reacting with generally positive expectations about the ability of the U.S. economy to stay strong and keep powering stocks higher. Commodities prices continued to gain ground, led by the energy sector, and positive dividend news among major components in the Dow Jones Industrials also added to positive sentiment. In addition, company-specific news spurred larger gains among individual stocks, and AK Steel (NYSE:AKS), Ashford Hospitality Prime (NYSE:AHP), and Dave & Buster's Entertainment (NASDAQ:PLAY) were among the best performers in the market as of midday.AK Steel surged 12% after getting favorable comments from analysts Wednesday. The long-beleaguered steelmaker has suffered from poor macroeconomic conditions globally for years, but value-hunting investors are finally starting to find signs of a turnaround for the industry. In particular, analysts at Credit Suisse upgraded AK Steel and some of its peers, arguing that supply deficits in the face of rising demand should finally start to lift depressed steel prices in the near future. With what analysts see as structural changes in the market for sheet and rolled products, AK Steel could enjoy big pricing increases that could boost profitability and mark a sea change in the industry's health going forward.Ashford Hospitality Prime soared 31% in the wake of receiving a buyout bid from a private investing group. The luxury-hotel real estate investment trust confirmed that it received an unsolicited proposal from the California-based Weisman Group to acquire all of Ashford's assets. The deal would pay investors in the REIT $20.25 per share in cash, which is almost 80% higher than where Ashford closed on Tuesday night. All told, the deal is worth nearly $1.5 billion when you include assumed debt, but the fact that Ashford stock is trading at less than $15 shows skepticism among investors about whether the deal will actually go through. Ashford's announcement says that its board is considering the offer but makes no guarantees that the board will eventually accept it.Finally, Dave & Buster's rose 9%. The company boosted its guidance for the full year in its most recent financial report released Tuesday afternoon, and it also approved a $100 million stock buyback program to return capital to shareholders. Dave & Buster's now expects sales for fiscal 2016 of $983 million to $995 million, up roughly $12 million from its previous range, and comparable-store sales growth should come in between 3.25% and 4.25% for the year. Expansion plans continue apace, with Dave & Buster's expecting to open nine to 10 stores and having six stores currently under construction. As CEO Steve King noted, ""Our unique entertainment, dining, and sports viewing venues are demonstrating their broad-based appeal despite challenges affecting many of our casual dining peers."" As long as that trend lasts, Dave & Buster's should be able to sustain its strong performance.10 stocks we like better than AK Steel HoldingWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It is Tuesday, Oct. 11, and I am joined via Skype by Fool.com contributor Daniel Kline, who is beaming in from an area of the country that has been in the headlines quite a bit recently -- that's West Palm Beach in South Florida. How are you doing, Dan?Dan Kline: I'm happy to say we're still here.Shen: Yeah, I was really happy to hear that you guys came out OK following the hurricane. I heard it was pretty rough.Kline: I don't want to minimize the people who actually lost property or got hurt, but compared to what they were predicting, it wasn't that bad. It was very windy, very rainy, scary. I'm sure if you live right on the ocean, it was terrifying. But they were predicting 125 to 130-mile winds, and we only got about half that. So, we're very lucky.Shen: Yeah. It seems like certain regions were right in the path, others were able to avoid it. Overall, I think, especially in your situation, having just moved down to Florida in the past month or two, and having to encounter what was generally considered to be one of the biggest storms in recent memory, that's interesting timing, to say the least.Kline: I'm hoping none of my neighbors put together that I have bad luck when it comes to the weather. They're predicting snow for next week.Shen: Our two big stories for today, first, we have the multi-billion dollar deal that was recently announced between the privately held Bass Pro Shops and its major outdoor retail rival Cabela's, ticker C-A-B. Second, we'll take a look at investor favorite Costco, just to see how the company is faring after its switch from American Express. Dan, let me provide a little bit of background for Bass Pro and Cabela's before we dive into the details behind the buyout. In case anyone has never had the opportunity of visiting one of these stores before, or even heard of them, maybe if you're a die-hard city dweller, both Bass Pro and Cabela's are two of the major big box stores catering to outdoor enthusiasts. They sell apparel, equipment, accessories for activities like hunting, fishing, camping. That includes firearms as well.With that, Dan, I'm going to let you take it away. Can you give us a little bit of detail behind the deal?Kline: These are two very similar companies. They each have around 100 stores, they each have around 20,000 employees. And it was sort of the case of, given all the internet competition, there wasn't really room for two players. It's not necessarily that they have too many stores. But if you combine them, their buying power goes up, their branding goes up, their marketing goes up, or both go down, and it gets easier to not have to compete with each other when they're both looking at Amazon and other online retailers selling a lot of the same things.It's worth noting that these aren't just stores. They're destinations. They're 180,000 to 200,000 and up square feet. They have shooting galleries, live animals, restaurants that serve wild game. It's a really fun place to go. And in some ways, those have been the most resilient retailers -- stores where there's a reason to go when you're not necessarily going to buy anything.Shen: Yeah. I want to point out, based on that, we were talking about before the show as well, it's really incredible, some of the attractions that their biggest flagship stores offer. For Cabela's, they take two different approaches. They have their current smaller store approach, think 40,000 to 100,000 square feet. Then, there's the legacy format, their larger stores, going up to 250,000 square feet, the biggest location being in Hamburg, Pennsylvania. You mentioned shooting galleries and things like that. This has, of course, the shopping, but then a restaurant, aquarium, museum, animal displays for regional game for hunters. You can actually take a virtual tour of that store specifically with Google Street View technology to give you a sense of how large it is and what it has to offer.Bass Pro Shop actually takes it to the next level. Their stores are largely in the 150,000 to 250,000 range for their Outdoor World flagship branding. The largest store in the Bass Pro fleet is an unbelievable 535,000 square feet. They basically took over an old sports and concert arena in Memphis, Tennessee, called the Pyramid. Think of a former stadium that's now a big store that has two restaurants, a hotel, a bowling alley, an aquarium, the tallest free-standing elevator in the world which leads to an observation deck at the top of the Pyramid. The Pyramid itself is one of the tallest in the world. To put that in perspective, that 535,000 square feet for that store, by comparison, the average Wal-Mart Supercenter -- which is huge, walking through that is its own experience -- they're only 180,000 square feet. So, this thing is just absolutely enormous.Kline: It's worth noting that most of the Cabela's and Bass Pro Shops are not in malls, they're in outlying areas, cheaper real estate. The big store has something important going for it. There's a reason to go there. I used to walk around with my son when he was four or five into one of these. But, we'd buy a little candy, maybe have lunch there. I'm not a big fisherman or hunter, but we would look at the stuff and play with the shooting gallery. And I spent a little bit of money. It was very crowded on the weekends, so the destination draws. The problem with that is, on Tuesday, as someone who has a background in retail, you don't have the same customer base. There's no families out on Wednesday afternoon looking to browse and not buy. So, you have the positive that this huge store almost functions as a museum. But you also have the negative that, a lot of the week, it's not that busy.So, going forward, there's a pretty big opportunity, and it sort of ties in to the Cabela's small format. You have all these malls around the country that have realized they can't just be stores. They have to have movie theaters and bowling alleys and restaurants and other destinations to drive business, because people aren't shopping in retail stores the way they used to. A smaller-format Cabela's, maybe with one attraction, builds into that really well. You're going to see a lot of vacancies in malls. There's a lot of Sears and K-Mart anchor stores that are going to become vacant. And the new Bass Pro Shops/Cabela's is really going to get some deals to be able to expand, if that's what they want to do.Shen: Absolutely. I love that idea, actually. They definitely have the attraction/entertainment aspect down. There's plenty of stories and testimonials you can hear from customers, especially in the more rural parts of the country where these stores cater to the people who are into fishing, gaming, and camping, where they will drive hours to go to one of these stores, because the selection and the things to do are limitless when you get to one of these bigger flagship locations.Kline: This is really just a smart mash-up. You simply didn't need two companies of a similar size fighting with each other. As we've talked about, we saw this happened in sporting goods. Sports Authority went out, and Dick's has been thriving because of it, because there's a certain amount of sporting goods -- and Cabela's and Bass Pro Shop are loosely in the sporting goods space -- that you want to touch. You don't necessarily want to buy a fishing rod that you've never handled. So, a certain percentage of people might go into a Bass Pro Shop, handle the fishing rod, and then go buy it online for cheaper. But, that person might at least buy something on the way out. Maybe they need some lures, maybe they really want some fudge, it doesn't really matter, they're going to spend money. They don't have to advertise to get you to not drive down the road to Cabela's, and that's an advantage.Shen: Yep. Diving into a few of the details behind the deal. Keep in mind, Bass Pro Shop is privately held, where as Cabela's is publicly traded. So, the cash offer for Cabela's was $65.50 per share. In total, that's about a $4.5 billion deal. Part of that deal, also, is Cabela's has its CLUB store co-branded credit card. That was previously managed by an entity they created, World's Foremost Bank. Part of the negotiation process was finding some financial firm card processor to take over that part of the operation. Capital One will be taking over that. There will be no change for customers themselves who are part of the Cabela's CLUB, and also the Bass Pro side -- they have a card and loyalty program, too. So, all that will keep going in operation as the companies come together. The combined entity will actually have a network of about 180 stores and 40,000 employees. The new company will also remain private, with the deal expected to close in the first half of 2017.Dan, did you have a chance to pull up any info on the buyout premium? I have to say, overall, Cabela's shareholders should generally be pretty happy based on the previous trajectory that their stock had seen in the past year or so.Kline: Yeah, it's about a 19% premium, if I remember correctly, over where the stock was trading when the deal was announced. It's one of those where you can't exactly say that's all it is, because the stock had moved at various points as this deal has been rumored and talked about. This is one of those cases where the quarterback of the football team and the head cheerleader, everyone wants them to get together, so eventually, they're going to go to prom together whether they like each other or not.What they're not talking about, because you don't want to scare people, is there's going to be some synergy from this. There's going to be some cost-saving. They're going to keep both brands. Supposedly, they're going to keep both headquarters. But the reality is, if you have a guy who's in charge of purchasing sleeping bags at Cabela's and a guy at Bass Pro Shop, there's no reason to have those separate, people. So you're going to start to see some back-office functionality. And maybe they'll have separate marketing teams. Maybe they'll have separate brands. But purchasing and payroll and some of those things are going to come together, so it's going to get cheaper for these two brands to exist.Shen: Also keep in mind that their geographic footprint of the store fleets themselves are pretty complementary. Bass Pro has the large majority of its stores in the eastern part of the United States. Only about a dozen locations spread out between Colorado, California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington. Cabela's adds about 30 to 40 more stores in those states in the western part of the country. So, while there's quite a bit of overlap toward the East Coast, Cabela's gives Bass Pro Shop that exposure in the more western states. Then, going back to that premium that you mentioned, the 19%, that's to the Oct. 2 close, right before the deal was announced. But when Cabela's announced that they were pursuing strategic alternatives back in December of 2015, since that point, that's a 40% premium, that $65.60 per share. Then, if you go back even further than that, which is part of the story of why this deal even came to be, is that an activist hedge fund, Elliott Management, they took an 11% stake in the company in October, and immediately, they stated their intention to push Cabela's toward finding an entity to buy it out. Since that point -- about one year ago -- there's a 96% premium since the Elliot Management stake was disclosed. Again, for a stock that hasn't traded in the $65 range since around early 2014 -- the shares peaked around $71 during that period -- this is a pretty nice takeaway for shareholders. I think a lot of people who came in during that peak are happy to recoup quite a bit of their investment.Kline: You have to be happy. But the reality is, the reason the stock has gone up since this rumor has happened is, there was only one logical buyer, and a deal was going to happen. It was simply the right thing to do. Even just looking at going from 100 stores to 180, you improve your supply lines, improve your warehouses. Even as you look at your online ability to fulfill orders, you now have locations and warehouses, so you can leverage things like ordering online and picking up in stores. The stock basically doubled since it became a rumor, because it just made so much sense. And now that it's happened, there's every reason to believe it's the right move.Shen: Yep. Final takeaway if you're Cabela's investor: As it stands right now, the offer from Bass Pro Shop values the company at about 22.5 times trailing 12-month earnings. So, quite favorable based on Cabela's outlook. Frankly, the company was in a tougher spot before Elliot Management came along and started pushing the company.Kline: Yeah, it had a rough quarter. When you're looking at this type of store, comparable sales is really the metric. Comparable-store sales were down 1.3% to the most recent quarter. That's not a disaster -- that's not Sports Authority numbers. But you look at all the people creeping up on it. You have a stronger Dick's, you have Amazon, you have various online retailers, REI, which is a much smaller-format store that inches up on this. So, you can see where the pressure was coming from. Getting bigger fast is a really good way to push back against that.Shen: The company ultimately had quite a few challenges to overcome if they wanted to work on their revenue, their profitability, expanding their network of stores. Ultimately, you mentioned some of those other names, this is a retail environment that does not take hostages.Kline: Yeah. To wrap up, this is also a case where a healthy company was having very negative stock pressure because of the short-term nature of many investors. Nobody was looking and saying, ""OK, down 1.3%, but Cabela's is well-positioned, it's in the right places, it has a type of store that's doing well even in the internet economy."" By going private, the company can now say, ""We're going to invest, we're going to do certain things, and we're not going to be tied to the quarterly reporting cycle."" For a retail store in a quickly changing environment, that might mean shuttering the very big store, or making a big change to a format, or opening up 10 new mall stores, and that might not reflect well in the one, two, three quarter picture. But, as a private company, you can take the long view in a way that, frankly, retail companies can't when they're publicly traded.Shen: But, one thing I will counter that with before we wrap up on this deal is that, the company, bottom line, net income fell 10% in 2014, another 6% in 2015, all this while revenue grew 11% over the same period. So, definitely, there are parts of the business that they needed to work on, frankly. Overall, in the outdoor sporting goods industry, with this tie-up and combined entity, there's still a ton of competition. Keep in mind, you mentioned REI, there's also Dicks, you also mentioned Gander Mountain, Big 5, Academy Sports, Modell's. That doesn't even include the e-commerce side of it. Besides Amazon, there are a lot of smaller players that are pure plays online. So, Bass Pro with Cabela's, larger entity. I think they have a pretty bright future. But ultimately, on the investing side, Cabela's shareholders, there's not much to do at this point but see the deal go through. It's expected to close in the first half of next year.Next up, we have our discussion of Costco. Before we dig into the company following its breakup with American Express, I wanted to thank Tommy John for supporting the show. Tommy John is revolutionizing men's underwear with a focus on fit, fabric, and function. Shirts that stay tucked, socks that stay up, and underwear that keeps everything in place, whichever way a man moves. It's funny that, when I was still wearing a suit everyday for work, I thought that all guys suffered together and were willing to put up with socks that would bunch up around your shoes every hour, having to retuck your shirt all the time. The Fool might let me get away with more casual dress around the office, but after having the opportunity to wear Tommy John gear, I have seen the light. Think of it like a mattress. You invest in that because you spend a third of your life sleeping. Well, you spend most of the remaining two-thirds in underwear most of the time. Tommy John can make that two-thirds of your day so much more comfortable with its breathable, lightweight, non-pilling and quick-drying fabrics. Tommy John offers a wide selection of styles, and the company provides a best-pair guarantee. If their underwear isn't the best you have ever worn, it's on Tommy John.

I mentioned American Express a few times. What exactly happened with this transition that they've made to Visa?Kline: Costco switched from its long-term credit card provider, American Express, to Visa. It was very much an abrupt transition, at least in the stores. There was messaging for almost a year to card holders. But basically, you went into Costco on June 19, and you could use your American Express. When you went in on June 20, that card no longer worked. The retailer no longer even took American Express at all, and you had to use your new Visa card. When that happened, the media exploded. ""Oh my God! People are going to leave Costco! They're never going to handle this, this is a disaster!""Some of its rivals, BJ's and Sam's, offered free entry to their stores for people holding the old cards. It had seemed like they made a mistake. That was backed up a little bit by the fact that Citigroup, which provides the cards, was overwhelmed with calls, about 1.5 million calls in the first few days. It seemed like people were having big problems, it was causing checkout problems, and this was going to create some real ill will. The reality is, things smoothed out pretty quickly. Within a few days, the call volume was well down. I talked about with some of the Citigroup people about this. Once people figured out the switch, they realized, ""OK, now I have a Costco Visa, not a Costco American Express."" And the rewards were actually a fairly decent amount better, an extra percent on gas and some tick ups across the board. This was played up like it was going to be a huge drag on earnings. I think -- you have some of the numbers in front of you -- it just wasn't.Shen: I think the company specifically mentioned in one of its recent reports that the switch to Visa from AmEx has saved the company enough money in fees to offset some of the falling-through prices that it's seen that have negatively impacted its business. So, we see that the transition wasn't the end of the world, wasn't as big of a negative impact that a lot of people feared it would be. That was definitely a news cycle that got a lot of headlines. But what about longer-term outlook for Costco? Something I know they've had challenges with is with e-commerce, that's been lagging, it seems like it's passing them by entirely. What do you think?Kline: I don't want to say I expect the bottom to fall off Costco. I think there's a certain percentage of its users that, ""Internet be damned, it's fun to go to Costco and sample things that you wouldn't sample."" Like, someone has cut up a Twizzler into little pieces -- you know what a Twizzler tastes like, but it's still fun to get one for free as you walk around and look for bargains and hunt for things, and come home with a pallet of meatballs even though you're a vegetarian. There's sort of the thing about going to Costco that's always going to protect some of their business. But as you mentioned, they've done very little on the internet. They send emails, they have some Web specials. But for the most part, it's not a great shopping experience, it doesn't feel like going to Costco in any way with the bargain hunting. It's not what they've built on.I do expect that, at some point, people are going to realize that the cost savings aspect of Costco -- you pay your $55 membership so you can save money by buying whatever it is, your toothpaste for your breakfast cereal in bulk quantity to save money. The problem is -- and, I'm a Costco member and an Amazon Prime member -- many of the things I used to buy from Costco in inconvenient quantities can be purchased from Amazon in the amount that I actually want them in. So, instead of having to buy six deodorant sticks, and I have to remember where they are over the next eight months or however long it takes to use them, I could just order the same thing from Amazon at roughly the same price. Costco has not had major sales dips because of this, but at some point, you have to think they're going to.Shen: Yeah. I think, it's kind of similar to the topic we were talking about previously. Maybe not as directly. Bass Pro and Cabela's create these attractions. But at the same time, I have been to a Costco on Friday evening and seen whole families there, and it's the Friday night entertainment. It's very amusing to see. And powerful, I think, as part of Costco's business model. This warehouse model translates very well to that in-person shopping experience. Now, how do you take that appeal and attractiveness of the warehouse bulk shopping experience and translate that into e-commerce, especially in a situation where, arguably, in most cases, those bulk orders and the savings you get translate to more expensive logistics for the company to get that item or order to you? It's going to be difficult.Kline: Absolutely. I'm guilty, I spend a Sunday afternoon entertaining my 12-year-old by promising him a $1 churro at Costco, and walking around. I mean, you can eat -- I can't, I have a gluten allergy -- but they have cheap pizza and hot dogs. People will go and have lunch and browse the store and come home to find a book on sale, or something ridiculous they never planned for. I don't think you can replace that aspect. I think the problem is, there are some interesting digital things you can do in bulk.Amazon has actually beat them to the punch. Amazon owns a company called Woot.com. I don't know if you've ever heard of Woot, but what they do is a sale of the day. It's now morphed into more than that, but basically, they take a few items that they purchased -- on clearance, likely, from someone else, or have in their own warehouses that wouldn't sell -- and they put out, ""OK, today we have this HP laptop, it's $249,"" and that's maybe half of the regular price. And people go crazy and buy them. I know I buy a lot of t-shirts from them. I've ordered things and thought, ""Oh boy! It will be great to have a 12-pack of HDMI cables!"" I think that's very much like the Costco experience. You go to their website every day, and you don't know what's going to be there. Then, you make a purchase that might not be the smartest purchase. Costco could do that. They have a user base. They could even do it on a broader level. They could put a car on sale, they could put health insurance on sale, or, ""Come into a store and get a hearing aid exam."" There's a lot of ways that Costco could leverage its physical stores, its ability to buy product. If you've ever watched Shark Tank, whenever we talk about Costco, they're notorious for negotiating, getting the price down and getting things very cheap. So it's not crazy to think Costco could say, ""OK, Christmas is in 10 weeks, we're going to have a different toy every day on our deals site,"" and mimic that in-store experience.Shen: If they are able to successfully launch something like that -- and, I do know of Woot, but I did not know that Amazon had taken it over. That's news to me. Ultimately, this is a company with $120 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. And in that time, their net income margin is usually around 2% or less. So, profitability is really thin. People talk about the business benefits from those membership fees --Kline: It's roughly 70%, 66% to 70% of profits, depending on the quarter.Shen: There you go. That would be something the company has to manage and work around as they transition to e-commerce. That is something they will really have to invest in and face off against, and realize it's a do-or-die situation at some point in the future.Kline: There are some trends. The Costco members, overall, are good. When you look at the same-store sales, and you subtract out the fact that gas prices are a drag because gas prices have been lower, they actually post some slight gains. It's basically flat when you factor gas in. That's not bad. But when you look at the membership numbers, overall membership revenues are up because they've managed to transition some people into more expensive memberships -- either business membership, and in a couple of countries, they've raised prices. But the overall renewal rates have ticked down a very slight amount, about 0.1% when you look at the different markets. That is by no means a cause to panic. It could absolutely be that a small amount of people, with the credit card, just went, ""Nah, I never really used this, I'm not going to take the new credit card.""About 85% of the credit card portfolio moved over, which is pretty close to the active number of people on the old credit card. So, that 15% that wasn't active, some of them might have said, ""Nah, I'm not going to renew this, I'm just going to cut this card in half and not pay my membership fee this year."" So, these aren't warning signs. They're almost like baby warning signs. You look at them and it's like, ""OK, if they start to lose 0.1% here and 0.1% there, at what point does it snowball and become renewal rates going from 89% to 83%?"" Then it becomes a real problem.Shen: Absolutely. OK, I take it that you're still relatively bullish with Costco, and think the prospects will be able to --Kline: I think they have a lot of time. I think there's an absolute flaw in their business. They pretty openly said they don't care that much about the internet, and they'll get to it when they get to it -- I'm really paraphrasing, nobody said anything that brash. That's indirectly what they said. But, I think because of the nature of their business and the fact that the mall as a destination has maybe faded, that Costco as a destination can buy them two or three years to figure out an internet strategy, or figure out more things like gas, that you can't buy on the internet. Amazon is not an effective delivery method for a tank of gas. So, if Costco can bring me in for gas, an eye exam, a hearing aid exam, maybe they'll add haircuts, maybe they'll expand their restaurants, it doesn't necessarily have to be directly competing with Amazon. Just has to be continuing to give people reasons to pay that $55 and occasionally visit the store.Shen: Yeah.

"What Apple Music and Spotify Can Learn From the ""Spotify Of China""","Aug 6, 2016 at 10:21AM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGESIn case you hadn't noticed, streaming is the future of music.However, for services like Spotify, Pandora (NYSE:P) and (to a lesser extent) Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music, the billion-dollar question remains whether streaming music services can ever produce meaningful profits.Thankfully, streaming music bulls recently placed another feather in their caps, thanks to a somewhat unexpected source.Making money in musicAccording to reporting from Mashable,  the general manager of Tencent's (NASDAQOTH:TCEHY) (NASDAQOTH:TCTZF) QQ Music service recently revealed the Chinese streaming service is indeed profitable.Tech investors are likely more familiar with Tencent for its incredibly popular WeChat messaging platform. However, it also owns the QQ brand,  which consists of instant messaging, gaming services, shopping, microblogging, and of course, the aforementioned streaming music service. Regardless of whether you've heard of it, QQ Music's purported ability to  turn a profit in streaming music makes it something of a rare bird in a world where Spotify, Pandora, and Apple Music are all likely continue to hemorrhage money for some time. So how is QQ Music doing it?IMAGE SOURCE: SPOTIFYAs it turns out, Tencent's QQ Music drives its profits through a unique mix of size and scrappiness. For starters, QQ Music serves significantly more users than Spotify, Pandora, and Apple Music combined -- over 400 million monthly active users (MAUs) and 100 million daily active users (DAUs), according to TenCent. For context, Spotify stands as the largest Western streaming platform, and it only counts 100 million total users.This size advantage gives Tencent's music service tremendous leverage in negotiating with record labels, which it appears the company has done with a deft touch. QQ Music has reportedly secured exclusive Chinese streaming distribution rights  with some major music labels. What's more, its massive scale has led to some speculation that the service also negotiated lower royalty rates -- payments that consume the bulk of Western services' revenues -- though that theory has yet to be independently verified.Tencent's QQ Music  also monetizes its users by allowing them to conduct additional transactions through the service, such as booking concert tickets, hailing taxis, and paying nominal fees to access exclusive content ahead of its platformwide release. To be sure, Spotify and Pandora have waded into selling concert tickets and the like, but not, it appears, to the extent that QQ Music has. Together, these moves offer a fairly clear map toward eventual profitability for Spotify, Pandora, and Apple Music, though actually following in QQ's footsteps and achieving it may be difficult.A streaming music playbookThe upside to QQ Music's example is that it apparently proves music streaming services can turn a profit. The downside is that its rubric for achieving this impressive feat may prove difficult for Apple, Spotify, and Pandora to replicate.IMAGE SOURCE: SPOTIFYThe main constraint is likely size, especially for Spotify and Pandora. Pandora adheres to a royalty rate structure like that of an AM/FM radio station, which makes widespread international expansion effectively impossible for now, though the launch of its widely acknowledged on-demand product could change this. However, for all intents and purposes, Pandora's chances of acquiring a similar user base to Tencent's QQ Music are a pipe dream today. Spotify's 100 million total users makes it by far the largest streaming service outside of China. However, it too would have to grow by a massive degree to approach QQ Music's 400 million MAU figure, which is unlikely to happen any time soon.Apple, on the other hand, could conceivably build a subscriber base in the hundreds of millions -- eventually. We know there are more than 800 million iTunes accounts.  However, consider that only 15 million users are  subscribed to the service after its first 13 months or so of operation , Apple Music growing to a scale similar to QQ Music seems like a distant prospect.However, each of those services can and should seek new ways to monetize its existing customers. All three have waded into driving these kinds of ancillary revenues, each in its own way. However, given the challenging economics of streaming, and QQ Music's purported profitability, the evidence suggests they could benefit by further pursuing this strategy.Streaming music has proven to be a far more ticklish space in which to produce profits than many may have expected. However, considering the high level of interest in it from both investors and consumers, its worth hoping that Spotify, Pandora, and Apple Music can eventually find sustainable business models.10 stocks we like better than Tencent HoldingsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Shares of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. Jumped 10% in September,"Oct 8, 2016 at 4:02PM","IMAGE SOURCE: GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO.What happenedShares of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (NASDAQ:GT) rose 10.1% in September, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Positive analyst commentary and the company's updated guidance and capital allocation plans both played a role in the stock's rise.So whatOn Sept. 6, an analyst from Deutsche Bank upgraded Goodyear stock to buy, attaching a $37 price target. The analyst cited a defensive position, with 80% of revenue coming from tire replacement, and the expectation that the company would greatly increase its cash payouts to shareholders as reasons for the upgrade.The analyst didn't have to wait long to be proven right. On Sept. 15, Goodyear provided a guidance and capital allocation update. The company is targeting $3 billion in segment operating margin in 2020, and aims to generate a total of $5 billion of free cash flow over the next four years. Goodyear also reconfirmed its 2016 financial targets.On the capital allocation front, Goodyear raised its dividend by 43% as part of a $4 billion capital allocation plan. The company also plans to spend on growth capital expenditures, restructuring, and debt repayment as part of the plan. The new quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share gives the stock a dividend yield of 1.2%.Now what""Our capital allocation plan demonstrates Goodyear's commitment to creating value by maintaining financial flexibility to execute our strategic plan, continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and investing for future growth while also providing significant direct returns to shareholders,"" said Goodyear CEO and President Richard Kramer.While Goodyear is still far from a great dividend stock, given the low yield, the big dividend increase coupled with the optimistic free cash flow guidance for the next few years managed to light a fire under the stock in September.10 stocks we like better than Goodyear Tire & RubberWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

How Does Xiaomi Technology Make Money?,"Jun 3, 2016 at 7:06AM","Xiaomi, one of China's top smartphone makers, is currently the world's most valuable start-up with a valuation of $46 billion. Last year, the company sold over 70 million smartphones as sales rose 5% to 78 billion yuan ($12.5 billion). However, that missed the company's previous goal of selling 80 million phones and generating 35% sales growth.Nonetheless, IDC reports that Xiaomi still captured 4.6% of the global smartphone market in the fourth quarter of 2015, making it the fifth-largest smartphone maker in worldwide after Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Huawei, and Lenovo -- in that order.That's pretty solid progress for a company that was founded just six years ago. Let's discuss how Xiaomi achieved that growth in such a short time, and whether its business model can withstand upcoming headwinds in the smartphone market.IMAGE SOURCE: XIAOMI.Xiaomi's business modelXiaomi sells smartphones that have nearly identical technical specifications as high-end flagships, but at much lower prices. It then cuts costs by relying solely on online sales and employing social media and word-of-mouth campaigns instead of traditional ads. Xiaomi reportedly only spends around 1% of its annual revenues on advertising, compared to 2% for Samsung. But neither company is as efficient as Apple, which spent only 0.8% of its revenue on ads last year.Xiaomi's latest flagship phone, the Mi 5, offers just slightly lower specs than Samsung's Galaxy S7 for less than half the price. However, that aggressive strategy produces paper-thin margins for Xiaomi. A filing at the end of 2013 revealed that Xiaomi's operating margin was just 1.8% -- a figure which has likely contracted over the past two years due to the ongoing commoditization of the smartphone market. Apple had an operating margin of 30.5% last year, while Samsung's IM (IT and Mobile) business had an operating margin of nearly 9%.Xiaomi is also following Apple's and Samsung's lead by developing its own ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH) based SoCs, codenamed Rifle, for some of its phones. This move could reduce its dependence on Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), which currently supplies the SoCs for Xiaomi's top-tier devices, as well as cut operating expenses and tighten up its supply chain.Expanding into new marketsXiaomi was recently overtaken in annual smartphone sales by China's Huawei, which replicated Xiaomi's business model of selling low-margin devices online. Huawei's smartphone shipments surged 44% last year to 108 million, thanks to robust overseas sales offsetting slower demand in China. Meanwhile, Xiaomi still generates about 90% of its sales from China. The company has taken baby steps into Brazil and India, but its of lack of overseas patents have prevented it from charging aggressively into saturated Western markets like the United States.Instead, Xiaomi is diversifying its product portfolio with new devices, like smart TVs, set-top boxes, air purifiers, Wi-Fi routers, audio devices, power banks, fitness trackers, Yi Technology's action cameras, and 4K drones. At first glance, this scattergun strategy seemingly indicates that Xiaomi wants to become the next Sony (NYSE:SNE) or Samsung with a diverse basket of consumer electronics.XIAOMI'S MI TV AND MI HEADPHONES. IMAGE SOURCE: XIAOMI.However, Xiaomi founder and CEO Lei Jun told Reuters in 2013 that his company should be compared to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) instead of Apple, noting that it only sold its devices at such thin margins to expand its MIUI ecosystem. ""Xiaomi selling mobile phones is like Amazon selling Kindles,"" stated Lei. ""So you understand why we sell them for so cheap."" MIUI, a ""forked"" version of Android, is installed across most of Xiaomi's devices and features its own app store.Xiaomi previously expected to generate $1 billion in Internet services revenue in 2015, but an internal document reviewed by Reuters indicated that sales only hit $564 million. Online games revenue doubled, but stiff competition in China's O2O (online-to-offline) mobile ecosystem market probably prevented many of Xiaomi's new digital initiatives -- like mobile payments and a partnership with Uber -- from gaining much ground.Will Xiaomi ever go public?Back when Xiaomi was posting triple-digit sales growth in 2014, many investors wondered if the rapidly growing start-up would go public. But now that its sales growth has slowed to the single digits, investors are likely wondering if the start-up should really be valued at nearly four times its 2015 sales.Xiaomi International VP Hugo Barra recently told Reuters that the company had ""no plans"" to raise new funds or file an IPO -- indicating that the world's most valuable start-up won't get more valuable anytime soon. Tech investors won't be able to invest in Xiaomi, but they should keep an eye on its evolving strategies -- which could impact a wide range of companies including Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Fitbit and GoPro in the near future.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

How Social Media Is Killing Chipotle's Recovery,"Jul 31, 2016 at 3:10PM","Chipotle Mexican Grill's (NYSE:CMG) food safety crisis has been over for six months. But you wouldn't know it from the company's sales results. During the recently ended second quarter, Chipotle's comparable restaurant sales plunged 23.6%.The company can probably blame social media for its slow recovery. The rapid spread of information -- and in some cases, misinformation -- via social media has made Chipotle's late 2015 E. coli outbreak much worse for the company than it otherwise would have been.E. coli and social media decimate Chipotle's salesThe first E. coli incidents were reported in late October, with other E. coli and norovirus cases traced to Chipotle in November and December. As news about Chipotle's food safety problems spread during late 2015, customer traffic quickly plunged.IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL.As a result, Chipotle went from posting modest comparable restaurant sales growth in October to a 16% comp decline in November and a 30% comp decline in December. On a monthly basis, comp sales trends bottomed out in January with a stunning 36.4% decline.Obviously, the E. coli outbreak itself was the primary cause of these sales declines. But social media likely played an important supporting role, as can be seen from a comparison to the 1992-1993 E. coli outbreak linked to Jack in the Box (NASDAQ:JACK).Jack in the Box's E. coli outbreak was far worse than Chipotle's. From late 1992 to early 1993, more than 500 people in the western U.S. became infected with E. coli, mainly from eating regular-size hamburgers from Jack in the Box. Four people died. By contrast, Chipotle's E. coli outbreak only affected 60 people, with no fatalities. (There was also a norovirus outbreak linked to Chipotle in December, but that is a much less serious illness.)Yet despite the severity of Jack in the Box's E. coli outbreak, its comparable restaurant sales fell only 22.2% during the second quarter of fiscal 1993, at the height of the crisis. Furthermore, its sales trend quickly recovered. In Q3 and Q4, Jack in the Box reported comp sales declines of about 9%.The difference in the impact of these E. coli outbreaks on sales results can probably be traced to social media. Social media increased awareness of Chipotle's food safety problems in the first place, and Chipotle's food safety issues continued to be the butt of jokes on social media long after the initial outbreak.The recovery has been bumpyChipotle has started to regain customers in the six months since the CDC declared that the E. coli outbreak was over. However, the company's management has been frustrated by the slow (and uneven) pace of the recovery. Here, too, social media deserves a lot of the blame.CHIPOTLE'S BRAND CONTINUES TO SUFFER ON SOCIAL MEDIA. IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL.For example, Chipotle's comp sales performance improved from down 36.4% in January to down just 22% by mid-March, suggesting that customers were starting to return. But in mid-March, a story quickly spread about several Boston-area Chipotle employees getting sick.The employees stayed home, following Chipotle's new strict food safety protocols. As a result, no customers became ill. However, while this incident showed that Chipotle's food safety protocols are working, on social media it was frequently portrayed as another sign that it wasn't safe to eat at Chipotle.As a result, sales slowed again. Indeed, the second quarter's comp sales decline of 23.6% was still below the mid-March sales trend.Even complete non-events have the potential to scuttle Chipotle's recovery due to the power of social media. Earlier this month, a popular author tweeted that his editor had to go the ER after getting sick from eating at Chipotle. So far, there is little to no evidence that the tainted food actually came from Chipotle, but it wasn't easy for Chipotle to quell the negative rumors.A comeback will take longer than expectedLast fall, I believed -- based on previous incidents like the Jack in the Box E. coli outbreak -- that Chipotle would recover from this setback relatively quickly. However, it appears that the rise of the internet and social media has made it much harder for restaurant chains to bounce back from food safety problems.Chipotle is still likely to emerge from its food safety crisis stronger than ever, but it could take several years for that to happen. The lesson for executives in the restaurant industry is clear: The right time to address food safety weaknesses is now. Waiting for food safety lapses to make customers sick is a recipe for disaster.10 stocks we like better than Chipotle Mexican GrillWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Nike, Inc. Kicks Off Its Fiscal Year With Strong International Growth","Sep 28, 2016 at 7:12AM","IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL.Nike (NYSE:NKE) released fiscal first-quarter 2017 results Tuesday after the market close. With shares of the athletic apparel and footwear giant down around 3% in after-hours trading as of this writing, it doesn't seem investors are particularly thrilled.But that doesn't mean Nike isn't pleased with where it stands. Let's take a closer look at how Nike kicked off its latest fiscal year. Nike's headline numbersQuarterly revenue increased 8% year over year, to $9.1 billion, and would have risen 10% had it not been for the stubborn negative influence of foreign currency exchange.That's slightly better than Nike's guidance provided three months ago. During last quarter's earnings conference call, CFO Andy Campion told investors to expect ""mid-single-digit reported revenue growth, roughly three points below our reported rate of futures growth."" Global futures were up 8% on a reported basis at the time, and 11% at constant currency. That translated to 6% growth in net income, to $1.25 billion, and -- thanks to repurchases over the past year, including 19 million shares bought back for $1.1 billion during the quarter -- 9% growth in net income per diluted share, to $0.73.Nike CEO Mark Parker added:Fueled by an incredible summer of sport, Nike delivered strong global growth-and led the industry through disruptive innovation. Q1 also showed how we're amplifying every category through sports style innovation, transforming retail by connecting the digital and physical experience and ushering in a new Era of Personalized Performance -- through product, consumer connections and our supply chain. Nike's strategic investments in these growth opportunities continue to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.Digging deeperWithin Nike's top line, NIKE Brand revenue climbed 10% year over year at constant currency, to $8.5 billion, driven by strong growth in sportswear, running, and the lucrative Jordan brand.On a geographic basis, overall growth was held back by a modest 6% year-over-year increase in NIKE Brand North American sales, to $4.03 billion. Meanwhile, every international region achieved double-digit revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis, including increases of 10% in Western Europe, to $1.76 billion, 16% in Central and Eastern Europe, to $440 million, 21% in China, to $1.02 billion, 18% in Japan, to $245 million, and 11% in emerging markets, to $945 million. To be fair -- and just as management predicted in June -- this marks an improvement over flat reported growth in North America last quarter, which itself was partly due to a shift in the timing of certain orders in the same year-ago period.Trending toward the bottom line, gross margin fell 200 basis points year over year, to 45.5%, as higher average selling prices were offset by what Campion insists are temporary headwinds, including foreign exchange, a greater mix of off-price products, costs associated with Nike's recent exit of its underperforming Golf equipment business, and ""a shift of expenses from operating overhead to cost of goods sold.""More specifically regarding the latter, Campion explained that cost of goods sold includes Nike's investments in innovation, manufacturing advances, and ""other product creation-related resources which have expanded significantly to fuel long-term growth.""And that's fair enough. Also, keep in mind Nike already told investors last quarter to expect gross margin to contract in fiscal Q1 as the company completed clearance of excess inventory to prepare for a stronger back half of the year.Next, we can't forget Converse, the retro footwear specialist Nike acquired for just $305 million in 2003. Revenue at Converse grew 4% year over year at constant currency, as declines in Europe and Asia-Pacific only slightly offset growth in North America. Nike is still shifting the Converse brand to a more direct operating model overseas, and only began its transition to a new enterprise resource management system earlier this year. As Nike irons out the wrinkles in this new model, Converse should begin demonstrating steadier global growth from its respective year-ago periods.Looking forwardFutures orders for NIKE brand footwear and apparel (scheduled for delivery from Sept. 2016 through Jan. 2017) climbed 5% year over year as reported, and 7% at constant currency, to $12.3 billion. That's another notable deceleration from last quarter's 8% and 11% growth in reported and currency-neutral futures orders, respectively. But it's not entirely surprising as Nike opts to effectively manage inventory and keep its line supply tight in today's increasingly difficult retail market. Also during this quarter's call, Campion pointed out that while futures are ""still an important aspect of [Nike's] business model,"" they're also increasingly less accurate with regard to predicting future revenue given Nike's ""evolving business mix."" So futures will no longer be referenced as a stand-alone metric in Nike's earnings press releases going forward, but rather discussed during each subsequent conference call in the context of Nike's broader financial guidance.Speaking of which, Nike now expects reported revenue in the fiscal second quarter to increase in the mid-single-digit range, according to Campion, ""at or slightly below our rate of reported futures growth."" Gross margin in the fiscal second quarter is also expected to contract by roughly 125 basis points, then approach flat levels in the second half compared to fiscal 2016. This represents a reduction from Nike's previous expectation for full fiscal-year gross margin to expand by 30 to 50 basis points, due primarily to the extended negative influence of the aforementioned gross margin headwinds Nike endured in fiscal Q1.Finally, for the full fiscal year, Nike continues to expect high-single-digit reported revenue growth, and currency-neutral revenue growth in the high single to low double digits.So apart from Nike's gross margin guidance reduction -- which the company argues is temporary and will serve to drive long-term growth -- there were no big surprises in Nike's latest quarter. In the end, as long as investors can continue enjoying the fruits of Nike's steady growth and aggressive capital returns initiatives, I think the market should be pleased with Nike's position today.

Western Digital Stock Upgraded: What You Need to Know,"Jan 5, 2017 at 2:10PM","For the second time in two days, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is winning buy ratings on Wall Street.As confirmed by TheFly.com, analysts at Chicago-based investment banker Guggenheim initiated coverage of Western Digital with a buy rating and a $100 price target, calling the stock their ""best idea in IT Hardware & Mobility."" This morning, we're hearing Canadian banker BMO Capital chime in with a buy rating of its own -- an upgrade from market perform to outperform, and a less ambitious $90 price target.According to BMO, with Western Digital's acquisition of SanDisk now complete, 2017 could be the year that the memory maker resumes growing. Here are three things you need to know.HARD DISK DRIVES OR SOLID STATE MEMORY -- WHICHEVER WAY YOU TURN, WESTERN DIGITAL HAS GOT YOU COVERED. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.1. Growth at a costWestern Digital experienced an 11% decline in sales in fiscal 2016, which ended in July. Those numbers included only a few weeks' worth of contributions from SanDisk's sales stream, however, because the SanDisk deal didn't close until mid-May.In Q1 of fiscal 2017 (last quarter), sales soared 40% with the infusion of new revenue from the new subsidiary. Granted, this growth came at a cost -- nearly $16 billion. But thanks to the SanDisk deal, we can now probably expect to see similarly strong results over the next three quarters.But after that, Western Digital must prove it can grow sales organically.2. ""the return of organic revenue growth""As explained in a write-up on StreetInsider.com, BMO believes we will ""see the return of organic revenue growth in FY17"" for Western Digital's core business. Demand for flash memory, which SanDisk specialized in, is ""supply constrained,"" says BMO. That's likely to support prices and boost profit margins. Additionally, the analyst sees ""catching up on 3D NAND, high capacity HDDs,"" and benefiting from ""favorable customer relationships.""Profit ""margin expansion"" should follow.3. How much expansion?That's the key question: Sales are almost certain to rise with the infusion of sales from SanDisk. But how profitable will these sales be?Data from S&P Global Market Intelligence show that Western Digital's gross profit margin hovered in the 29% range for about four straight years before slipping toward the 27% range in 2016 (where it now sits). Granted, 27% is a better gross margin than the 20% that archrival Micron (NASDAQ:MU) gets, but it's still a sizable slump. Operating profit margin has been hit even harder, falling from a recent high of 16.5% in 2012 for example, to just 6.7% today -- and net profit margin is running negative (as it is, too, at Micron).Bonus thing: Valuing Western DigitalWith trailing losses of $407 million for the past 12 months, Western Digital stock currently has no positive P/E ratio to help us value it. The stock does have positive free cash flow, though -- $1.26 billion in real cash profits generated over the past 12 months. And on a $20.1 billion market capitalization, this gives the stock a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 16.That seems a bit high for a stock that most analysts believe will grow earnings at no more than 10% annually over the next five years. The stock looks even more expensive if you ding it for the heavy debt load (now $8.8 billion ex-cash) that Western Digital took on to acquire SanDisk.But if BMO is right about margins expanding, then combined with stronger sales, Western Digital's profits could grow a lot faster than 10% in relatively short order. (Especially when you notice that analysts forecast much faster growth for Micron.) How fast is hard to say, but consider that just returning to the 16.5% margin of 2012, without additional sales, would permit profits to grow by nearly 150%.Long story short? Between the debt load and the high stock price (up 17% last year), Western Digital stock is no obvious bargain today. But given the clear trend of rising sales, and the potential catalysts for growing profits on those sales, I see analysts' consensus expectation of only 10% profits growth as overly conservative. I can't say for sure that BMO is right about Western Digital stock being worth $90 (or about Guggenheim's $100 price target, for that matter). But is it reasonable to think the stock might gain 26% or more as profits explode skyward?Yes, it is.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Western Digital and Seagate Stocks Win Upgrades: What You Need to Know,"Apr 12, 2017 at 8:00AM","Everything old is new again. For years, we've read stories about how people aren't buying PCs anymore, and how that was lousy news for computer hard drive makers like Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) -- but no more. Yesterday, Wall Street analysts at Longbow Research and JPMorgan simultaneously decided to recommend buying shares of both of these big hard drive makers.Here are three things you need to know about why they did that.HARD DISK DRIVES (HDDS) ARE IN FOCUS ON WALL STREET THIS WEEK. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.1. Upgrading Seagate...We begin our story with Seagate, upgraded on Tuesday from neutral to buy at Longbow Research, with a $55 price target. Last month, as you may recall, we talked a bit about Goldman Sachs and its upgrade of Seagate storage rival Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), which Goldman said would benefit from ""tight"" supplies of NAND flash memory around the globe.That was good news for Micron, which makes a lot of money from NAND. It may also be good news for Seagate, though (which like Micron -- and like Western Digital -- also makes NAND memory). This is because, as TheFly.com reports, ""shortages of NAND are causing demand for hard disk drives to rise"" as an alternative to flash memory. Longbow believes this demand will obey the laws of supply Â­and demand, by driving hard disk drive prices up -- boosting profits at Seagate.2. ...and Western Digital as wellAnd not only at Seagate. JPMorgan sees this dynamic of rising hard disk prices benefiting Western Digital stock as well -- maybe even more than Seagate. Additionally, JPMorgan points out that sales of personal computers are ""stabilizing,"" according to TheFly.com, while at the same time Western Digital's costs are falling as the company finds ""synergies"" among its recent acquisitions.Stable PC sales, falling costs, and widening profit margins on hard drives -- that all adds up to higher profits for Seagate, in JPMorgan's view, and justifies an overweight rating and a $116 price target on the stock.3. Just how good will these profits get?Doing a bit of quick pencil work, JPMorgan estimates that Western Digital stock will produce profits of $8.31 per share this year (3% better than previously expected). 2018 profits could be even better -- as much as $11.13 per share. Both those numbers would be significant improvements over the $1.59 per share that Western Digital lost last year. Even the lower number -- $8.31 -- would be enough to make 2017 the most profitable year Western Digital has booked in a single calendar year this millennium.But would that be enough to make Western Digital a buy?The upshot for investorsBecause when you get right down to it, that's what matters to investors: Yeah, 2017 (and 2018) might be very profitable years for Seagate stock, and might be even better for Western Digital. But if the stocks cost too much relative to the profits, then neither stock would make for a good investment.Fortunately, that looks to be not the case. At JPMorgan's projected profits, Western Digital stock looks likely to both earn great profits, and offer great value to investors as well. Here's how the numbers work:JPMorgan is saying Western Digital will earn $8.13 this year. But Western Digital stock only costs about $85 a share. That works out to about a current-year price-to-earnings ratio of 10 on Western Digital stock. And with most analysts on S&P Global Market Intelligence predicting Western Digital will grow profits at 13.5% annually over the next five years, that works out to a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 0.8. Throw in a modest 2.4% dividend yield, and Western Digital stock is looking quite attractively valued indeed.And Seagate? The story there is even better, because whereas JPMorgan bases its Western Digital valuation on projected profits, Seagate is already earning actual profits -- $514 million last year, and more than twice what it earned in 2015. S&P estimates show Seagate growing its earnings fourfold this year, to $3.22 per share. If they're right, that works out to about a current-year earnings valuation of 15 times on the stock. And again, between Seagate's projected growth rate (15%) and its dividend (5.3%), that looks like a very good deal for investors, indeed.Long story short, I'm fully onboard with both these analysts' upgrades this week. Longbow Research may lean toward Seagate, while JPMorgan prefers Western Digital. I think either stock should perform just fine.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Western Digital Corp. Shares Soared in January,"Feb 13, 2017 at 6:17PM","What happenedShares of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) rose 17.3% in January of 2017, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.So whatThe digital storage specialist quietly gained about 7% in the first three weeks of January on reports that Western Digital might buy Toshiba's (NASDAQOTH:TOSBF) semiconductor business. Then, sector rival Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) reported stellar earnings, taking Western Digital along for a 7% overnight gain. Western Digital's own results, published the next day, also exceeded analyst expectations, but the good news had already been priced in due to Seagate's strong market signals.IMAGE SOURCE: WESTERN DIGITAL.Now whatIn January's second-quarter report, Western Digital saw strong demand for large-capacity hard drives and all of its solid state drives (SSDs) based on flash memory chips. Western Digital increased its presence in both of these markets via strategic acquisitions of Hitachi's enterprise storage division and SSD specialist SanDisk. I'd be surprised to see any further buyout plays in the next few quarters, as the current product portfolio seems perfectly tailored for the current and near market trends. As for the rumored Toshiba deal, the two companies have been partnering for years. The Japanese technology giant is in dire need of cash, and could ask Western Digital to take a larger ownership stake in their joint ventures, but private equity firms would be the more logical spinoff target there.Long story short, Western Digital is unlikely to rock the boat very hard at the moment -- the current business plan is already A-OK."
"Why Bob Evans Farms, Logitech International, and Western Digital Jumped Today","Jan 25, 2017 at 5:24PM","Wednesday was the day that the Dow Jones Industrials finally rose above the 20,000 level, ending weeks of speculation about whether and when the average would climb above the much-watched milestone. Strong earnings reports from many companies helped boost enthusiasm about the market, and new measures from the Trump administration received a generally favorable audience from the business community. Major market benchmarks were up in the neighborhood of 1%, but many stocks did even better. Bob Evans Farms (NASDAQ:BOBE), Logitech International (NASDAQ:LOGI), and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) were among the best performers of the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.IMAGE SOURCE: BOB EVANS FARMS.Bob Evans makes a saleBob Evans Farms jumped more than 20% after the company agreed to sell its restaurant unit to a private equity buyer. Under the terms of the deal, Golden Gate Capital will pay $565 million for Bob Evans Restaurants, and Bob Evans expects to end up with net proceeds of between $475 million and $485 million. The continuing company will focus on its BEF Foods unit, which also announced it would buy Pineland Farms Potato Company for $115 million. Shareholders can expect a special dividend within a couple months after the restaurant deal closes, with the amount estimated at $7.50 per share. Activist investor Sandell Asset Management, which had urged the company to take decisive action along these lines, was pleased by the deal and by the prospects of Bob Evans continuing as a packaged-foods company.Logitech has a good holiday seasonLogitech International climbed 13% after issuing preliminary results for its holiday quarter that included the highest retail revenue in its history. The maker of accessories and peripherals saw sales climb 7% to $666.7 million, and earnings of $0.59 per share were up by roughly half from year-ago levels. CEO Bracken Darrell said that ""our results exceeded expectations and were outstanding, with broad-based growth across all our regions and almost all product categories."" The company also boosted its full-year fiscal 2017 outlook, expecting 12% to 13% retail sales growth and adjusted operating income of between $225 million and $230 million. Those figures are up three to four percentage points and $25 million to $30 million respectively, suggesting that Logitech expects continued success for the foreseeable future.Western Digital rides its rival's coattailsFinally, Western Digital gained 5%. The company gained ground after rival Seagate Technology issued a favorable earnings report, including an 80% jump in net income and better guidance for the current quarter. Yet after the bell, Western Digital gave back some of its gains despite reporting solid adjusted earnings of $2.30 per share. ""We saw healthy demand for capacity enterprise hard drives, all NAND-based products, and hard drives in client applications,"" said CEO Steve Milligan, and ""we continue to execute well on key strategic priorities."" As the ongoing move toward cloud computing drives demand for storage, it will be interesting to see how much of a growing pie Western Digital is able to carve out for itself."
3 Top Data Storage Stocks to Buy in 2017,"May 23, 2017 at 12:13PM","The data storage market is sometimes overlooked by growth-oriented tech investors -- it generally conjures up thoughts of aging HDDs (hard disk drives) in a highly commoditized market. But the data storage market also includes higher-growth categories like SSDs (solid state drives), cloud backup solutions, and enterprise storage platforms.Data storage needs will inevitably rise due to the growing use of streaming media, cloud storage solutions, cloud-based apps, data virtualization, and other data-intensive tasks. Let's examine three solid data storage stocks which will likely benefit from that growth -- Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Carbonite (NASDAQ:CARB), and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP).IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Western DigitalWestern Digital acquired flash memory maker SanDisk for about $19 billion last year. That move complemented WD's other acquisitions in the flash memory space, including Virident, STEC, VeloBit, Amplidata, Skyera, and Hitachi's hard drive unit, which now handles most of WD's NAND assets.All these moves diversified WD's top line away from its aging HDD business with higher-growth SSD and flash memory products. By comparison, its rival Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) still generates most of its revenue from HDD sales, and has a much weaker presence in enterprise SSDs.Western Digital has posted three straight quarters of double-digit annual sales growth since the SanDisk acquisition closed, and analysts expect its revenue and earnings to respectively grow 47% and 75% this year. That momentum is expected to continue with 6% sales growth and 34% earnings growth next year. That makes WD -- which trades at just 9 times forward earnings with a forward yield of 2.3% -- seem like an undervalued play on the data storage industry.CarboniteCarbonite provides a cloud backup platform for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with fewer than 300 employees, which is generally a less crowded market than the one for larger enterprises. The company greatly expanded its storage capabilities by acquiring Seagate's EVault cloud backup service for $14 million last January -- a bargain, since Seagate bought the service for $185 million back in 2006.Shares of Carbonite have more than doubled over the past 12 months, fueled by the company's five straight quarters of double-digit sales growth. Those numbers were inflated by its acquisition of EVault, but the company also beat top and bottom line forecasts during each quarter due to the stronger-than-expected growth of EVault and cost-cutting synergies between its older and newer platforms.Wall Street expects Carbonite's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 17% and 28% this year, followed by 10% sales growth and 29% earnings growth next year. Carbonite may look pricey at 67 times earnings, which is well above its industry average of 28, but its forward P/E of 25 looks fairly reasonable.NetAppNetApp is one of the largest data storage and management service providers in the world. To widen its moat against rivals like Dell EMC, Seagate, and Western Digital, NetApp expanded over the past decade by acquiring Riverbed Technology's backup and protection products, flash storage vendor SolidFire, and numerous smaller companies.NetApp is a slow-growth company. Wall Street expects its revenue to fall 1% this year and rise 2% next year. However, its earnings are expected to rise 27% this year and 14% next year, fueled by its growth in the higher-margin flash array market, reduced operating expenses, and share buybacks.NetApp pays a forward dividend yield of 1.9%, and it has hiked that payout annually for three straight years. Its current P/E of 36 might look pricey, but it's actually much lower than industry average of 82 -- which makes the company a decent ""best in breed"" enterprise storage play for conservative investors.But mind the risks...Western Digital, Carbonite, and NetApp all have unique strengths in the data storage market, but they also have significant weaknesses. WD's near-term growth could be impacted by an ongoing legal battle with Toshiba over the divestment of a joint venture. Carbonite's growth could slow down if bigger enterprise rivals expand into the SMB market. NetApp could fall behind the data storage tech curve if it prioritizes cost cutting measures over R&D investments. Therefore, investors should do their due diligence and weigh these risks against the potential rewards before buying any of these data storage stocks."
The 3 Best Dividend Stocks in Data Storage,"Jun 1, 2017 at 5:58PM","The data storage market is generally considered a slow-growth, heavily commoditized market. But as I mentioned in a recent article, there are still good growth plays in the space that crushed the S&P 500's return over the past 12 months. Today, I'll take a closer look at the best dividend plays within that industry -- Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP).IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.Western DigitalWestern Digital, the biggest hard drive maker in the world, pays a forward dividend yield of 2.2%. Its earnings-based payout ratio is at a whopping 219%, but that figure was distorted by its $19 billion acquisition of SanDisk last year.However, Western Digital spent just 24% of its free cash flow on dividends over the past 12 months, and SanDisk's assets are now boosting its cash flows -- which gives it plenty of room for future hikes. It's also raised its dividend annually for four straight years.SOURCE: YCHARTSWD's purchases of flash storage makers like SanDisk helped it pivot away from the aging HDD (hard disk drive) market with smaller SSDs (solid-state drives) which load data faster, consume less power, and have no moving parts.The SanDisk acquisition also helps WD benefit from growing demand for NAND flash memory -- which has caused prices to surge worldwide. Analysts expect WD's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 47% and 75% this year (due to the SanDisk purchase), followed by 6% sales growth and 34% earnings growth in 2018.SeagateSeagate, the second largest hard drive maker in the world, pays a much higher forward yield of 5.8%. It spent 77% of its earnings and 38% of its free cash flow on dividends over the past 12 months.Those ratios look sustainable, but Seagate hasn't raised its dividend since 2015 due to cash flow concerns. However, Seagate's free cash flow has rebounded over the past year as data-heavy applications boosted demand for its enterprise storage products.SOURCE: YCHARTSSeagate has a much smaller presence in the consumer SSD market than WD, but it still sells enterprise SSDs to big companies. It's partnered with memory chipmaker Micron (NASDAQ:MU) in these efforts, which partly offsets its lack of a dedicated flash memory division like Western Digital's SanDisk.However, SanDisk lacks WD's growth momentum: its revenue is expected to dip 2% this year, but its earnings -- boosted by buybacks and better cost controls -- are expected to nearly double.NetAppNetApp is one of the biggest providers of data storage and management services in the world. It pays a forward dividend yield of 2%, and it spent 41% of its earnings and 26% of its free cash flow on those payments over the past 12 months.NetApp started paying a dividend in 2013, and has hiked its dividend annually in every subsequent year. But unlike Western Digital and Seagate, NetApp's free cash flow has declined in recent years due to a series of acquisitions -- including its $870 million purchase of flash storage vendor Solidfire last year.SOURCE: YCHARTSNetApp is a slow growth stock, and Wall Street expects just 2% sales growth this year. However, its earnings are expected to grow 11% this year as it cuts stock buybacks and taps the synergies of its acquired businesses. However, investors should note that rising NAND prices -- which act as a tailwind for Western Digital -- represents a headwind for NetApp, which purchases the chips for its flash-based devices and services.The key takeawaysWD, Seagate, and NetApp are all decent income stocks, and they're not terribly expensive relative to the industry average P/E of 85 for data storage providers. WD has a negative trailing P/E, due to the SanDisk acquisition, but it trades at just 9 times forward earnings. Seagate and NetApp respectively trade at 18 and 37 times earnings.Those ratios are surprisingly low, considering that WD and Seagate both nearly doubled over the past 12 months as NetApp rallied nearly 60%. But investors should also be aware that an economic slowdown could cause big orders of enterprise storage devices and services to abruptly stall out. Therefore, they should do their homework on these stocks before buying them as long-term income investments.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Top Memory-Chip Stocks to Buy in 2017,"Apr 11, 2017 at 3:36PM","Memory-chip prices rebounded in the second half of 2016 after slumping for two straight years. That recovery, which is expected to continue throughout this year, is mainly attributed to tighter supplies and rising demand among device makers.That's why many memory-chip stocks rallied over the past year. Let's look at three promising plays in this cyclical market -- Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Samsung Electronics (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) -- and see if they can continue rising in 2017.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Micron TechnologyMicron is the third largest mobile DRAM and fourth largest NAND manufacturer in the world. It's arguably the most straightforward play on the memory-chip market for investors, since rivals such as Samsung, Toshiba, and Western Digital generally have more diversified businesses.Micron is currently developing next-gen memory technologies such as 3D NAND and 3DXPoint with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and it's scaling up by buying smaller memory-chip makers such as Inotera Memories. Micron has a pretty high enterprise value of $40 billion, but it's frequently cited as a takeover target for Intel or China's state-backed Tsinghua Group. Tsinghua already tried to buy Micron once in 2015, but the deal was blocked by U.S. regulators on national-security concerns.Rising memory prices are expected to boost Micron's revenue by 58% to $19.6 billion this year. Its earnings are expected to surge from $0.06 per share in 2016 to $4.28. That growth is expected to continue, with 9% sales and 20% earnings growth in 2018. Shares of Micron already surged 160% over the past 12 months, and its P/E of 50 looks high, but it's easily justified by its earnings growth.Samsung ElectronicsSamsung is the world's largest manufacturer of DRAM and NAND chips. However, it's also a heavily diversified company that sells home appliances, consumer electronics, mobile devices, display panels, and other electronic components.Samsung's memory-chip revenues rose 10% to 37.9 trillion won ($33.3 billion) in fiscal 2016, accounting for 74% of its total semiconductor revenues and 19% of the company's top line. That made the semiconductor unit Samsung's fastest-growing business and offset Note 7-related declines at its mobile business. The higher margin of the semiconductor business also enabled it to bring in 47% of its operating profits -- which offset lower margins at its mobile and consumer electronics businesses.Unlike other leading memory-chip makers, Samsung has its own foundry, which enables it to maintain tighter control over its chips while keeping production costs low. Its production of other components such as displays also gives it bundling power with OEMs -- a strength that Micron and other smaller rivals lack.Wall Street expects Samsung's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 11% and 46% this year, as the new Galaxy S8, higher memory-chip sales, and stabilizing display demand help it move past its Note 7 debacle and ongoing corruption probe. Samsung still trades at just 11 times earnings, despite rallying nearly 50% over the past 12 months.Western DigitalAfter acquiring SanDisk last year, Western Digital became the world's third largest manufacturer of NAND memory after Samsung and Toshiba. Before that, it purchased Hitachi's hard-drive unit, HGST -- which now handles most of WD's NAND assets -- as well as other flash-memory players such as Virident, STEC, VeloBit, Amplidata, and Skyera.IMAGE SOURCE: SANDISK.All those moves diversified WD's business away from traditional hard disk drives, which were being displaced by flash memory-based solid-state drives. SSDs are more expensive, but they're faster, they're more power efficient, and they last longer because they didn't have any spinning platters.WD's aggressive expansion into the NAND market paid off. Its revenue, boosted by the SanDisk deal, is expected to rise 44% this year to $18.7 billion and grow another 2% in 2018. Its earnings are expected to jump 59% this year and 15% next year as its bigger scale reduce production costs. WD has rallied more than 80% over the past 12 months, but the stock trades at just 9 times forward earnings -- indicating that it still has room to run.But mind the long-term risksSome analysts have called the current spike in memory prices the start of an ""ultra-super cycle"" for the industry. But that doesn't signal an all-clear for Micron, Samsung, and Western Digital just yet.Last December, Micron warned that state-backed Chinese companies could flood the market with cheap memory chips in the near future, in the country's bid to build a domestic semiconductor industry. If that happens, memory prices would plummet -- which would help device makers and consumers but crush memory-chip makers. Investors should carefully weigh those risks before loading up on memory-chip stocks. 10 stocks we like better than Micron TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Intel Corporation's Optane Cache for PCs Sounds Coolâ€¦ If It Works,"Jan 12, 2017 at 8:08PM","A few days ago, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) formally unveiled its seventh-generation Core processor family for desktop computers, known as Kaby Lake. With the launch came new chips from Intel as well as new motherboards using the company's new Z200-series motherboard chipsets (the top of the line ones targeted at high-end personal computers are known as Z270).The main new feature that came with the Z270 chipset is support for the company's new Optane memory technology. Optane is the marketing name for the company's upcoming 3D XPoint memory technology, a new type of memory that's supposed to be much faster than the NAND flash used to build today's solid state storage drives.3D XPOINT MEMORY CHIPS, WHICH INTEL MARKETS AS OPTANE. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL. Intel's marketing pitch for Optane is simple: a small Optane-based solid state drive can be installed into a system alongside a traditional hard disk drive to deliver ""[solid state drive]-like speed and [hard disk drive] capacity.""IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL. This all sounds like a cool idea, and in theory, could boost Intel's PC dollar content share while also helping the hard disk drive makers. Let's look at how it could do so, if the technology works as advertised (a big ""if"").The advertised value propositionThe value proposition, particularly for desktop personal computer users, goes something like this. Hard disk drives, which are produced primarily by Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), are generally very inexpensive on a per-gigabyte basis. To put this into perspective, it costs about $260 to purchase a 1-terabyte solid state drive for a notebook or desktop computer (one can spend much more for faster/better quality drives, though). A 4-terabyte hard disk drive (that's four times the storage capacity as the solid-state drive mentioned above), runs only about $163 as of a recent check.This means that the cost per gigabyte (or, more generally, cost per unit of storage capacity) of hard disk drives is still substantially lower than those of solid state drives, even as the latter's cost has come down considerably over the years.For users who require lots of storage space for, say, high-resolution videos, video games (a single modern triple-A game can take up over 100 gigabytes of space on a computer disk drive), or other large programs, building systems with all flash storage can be prohibitively expensive.At the same time, solid state drives are much faster than hard disk drives, so users may want to keep performance-sensitive applications on a solid-state drive, while relegating the remaining files and programs to higher-capacity but slower hard disk drives.The value proposition that Intel and its partners are advertising goes something like this: A small, but very fast Optane-based solid state storage drive (Intel says Optane is substantially faster than traditional NAND flash) acting as a ""cache"" to a large hard disk drive can allow a system to enjoy similar storage performance to one that's equipped with NAND-flash based storage drives for a much lower overall cost. Potential winners and losersIf the technology works as claimed and sees significant adoption, then there could be winners and losers.Among the potential winners, I see Intel, as it would be able to gain content share in personal computers by selling Optane-based solid state drives (Intel does not supply hard disk drives today, and while it does build consumer NAND-flash solid state drives, its share in the consumer market isn't high).The hard disk drive makers, too, could benefit. If Optane combined with hard disk drives really delivers the performance of all-flash desktop computers for a much lower price, then this could erode the value proposition of all-flash storage setups in some cases, potentially slowing the shift from hard disk drives to solid state drives in desktop personal computers.The losers would be vendors of solid state drives, as Optane Cache + hard disk drive could reduce demand for traditional flash-based solid state drives.A big caveatThere have been lots of schemes like what Intel is proposing with its Optane caches done in the past, so this isn't exactly new. Hard disk drive makers have (and in some cases still do) offer hard disk drives with small NAND flash caches built in to try to deliver performance that's close to that of pure solid state drives.In 2011, Intel's Z68 desktop platform included a technology called Smart Response Technology (SRT) that allowed users to pair small flash-based storage drives with large hard disk drives to try to achieve solid state drive-like speed on the cheap. Per AnandTech's testing, SRT didn't deliver ""the same performance as a large dedicated [solid state drive]"" but it could allow users to ""turn any hard drive into a much higher performing storage device.""What could potentially make the Optane-based version of this concept more interesting than previous efforts is that instead of pairing a small NAND-flash based solid state drive with a large hard disk drive, Intel is pairing Optane technology (which Intel says is much faster than NAND flash-based drives) with hard disk drives to try to get NAND-flash solid state drive-like performance.It'll be interesting to see how this technology fares in the real world and, perhaps more importantly, if system builders and consumers ultimately adopt it.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Top Semiconductor Stocks to Buy in 2017,"Apr 1, 2017 at 5:35AM","Many semiconductor stocks surged in 2016, thanks to rising demand for chips across multiple industries. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which tracks many of the top names in the sector, rallied almost 50% over the past 12 months.But despite that robust performance, some semiconductor stocks could rise even further this year. Let's take a look at three chip plays that still have room to run: Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.XilinxXilinx is the largest maker of FPGA (field programmable gate array) chips in the world. These chips can be reprogrammed after being installed, making them well suited for a wide variety of machines -- including servers, connected cars, smart appliances, and airplanes. FPGAs are usually paired with traditional CPUs to handle industry-specific tasks. That's why Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) acquired Xilinx's only meaningful rival, Altera, in late 2015.That acquisition made Xilinx -- which launched 16nm chips a year before Intel caught up with 14nm ones -- a rumored takeover target for larger chipmakers like Qualcomm. The Altera acquisition also convinced Intel's chipmaking rivals, like Qualcomm and IBM, to pair their CPUs with Xilinx's FPGAs to match Intel's new programmable capabilities.Wall Street expects Xilinx's revenue and earnings to respectively grow 6% and 11% this year. It pays a forward dividend yield of 2.3%, and it's raised that payout annually for six straight years. Xilinx's P/E of 25 is a bit higher than its industry average of 22, but its growing network of partnerships and attractiveness as a takeover target shouldn't be ignored.Micron TechnologyMicron is often more volatile than other semiconductor stocks because demand for its DRAM and NAND memory chips is cyclical. Demand for those chips was sluggish throughout most of 2016, due to a slowdown in PC sales, the commoditization of the mobile device market, and a glut of memory chips crushing market prices.IMAGE SOURCE: MICRON.However, those trends reversed in late 2016, as many device makers reported shortages of memory chips and rising prices. That's why Micron posted double-digit sales growth over the past two quarters, which ended six straight quarters of annual declines. Analysts expect Micron's revenue to rise 57% this year and for its non-GAAP earnings to surge from $0.06 to $2.42.Micron rallied more than 170% over the past 12 months, but it trades at just six times forward earnings -- indicating that the market remains pretty bearish on its chances (I'd argue that it's overly bearish). However, investors should beware of two major headwinds. First, competition from larger players like Samsung and Western Digital's SanDisk could still put pressure on Micron's margins. Second, Micron warned that Chinese chipmakers could flood the memory market with cheap chips in the near future, which could push Micron into a downward cycle again.Advanced Micro DevicesAMD's upside potential might seem limited after rising nearly 400% over the past 12 months. Yet investors shouldn't ignore the chipmaker's compelling comeback story. After years of being squeezed in x86 CPUs by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and high-end GPUs by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD carved out a growing niche in EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) chipsets for gaming consoles and other devices.IMAGE SOURCE: AMD.That move enabled AMD to post three straight quarters of positive year-over-year sales growth -- which broke a two-year streak of top-line declines. Analysts expect AMD's revenue to rise 11% this year and for it to achieve non-GAAP profitability again following multiple years of net losses.As for AMD's valuation, its EV/sales ratio of 3.1 remains comparable to Intel's ratio of three and much lower than NVIDIA's ratio of 8.6.Besides gaming consoles, AMD plans to turn up the heat on NVIDIA with more low-end VR-ready GPUs and its next-gen Vega GPUs. It also plans to strike back at Intel with its new Ryzen chips, which offer comparable performance as Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake chips at lower price points. Those efforts could lift AMD to new highs, but the stock could also plunge if demand for these chips falls short of expectations.The key takeawaysXilinx, Micron, and AMD could all climb higher this year, but each of these companies face clear risks -- Xilinx faces upcoming FPGA battles with Intel, Micron faces challenges from bigger chipmakers, and AMD must land some meaningful blows against Intel and NVIDIA to maintain is momentum. Therefore, investors should carefully weigh these pros and cons before buying any of these semiconductor stocks.10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro DevicesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Silicon Motion's Pain Is Micron Technology's Gain,"Feb 1, 2017 at 1:40PM","Shares of Silicon Motion Technology (NASDAQ:SIMO) recently dipped after the SSD controller and specialty RF IC maker's robust fourth quarter growth was overshadowed by soft guidance for the first quarter. The company's fourth quarter revenue rose 47% annually to $144.2 million, beating estimates by $2.5 million. Earnings per ADS surged 73% to $0.95 per share, topping expectations by $0.06.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.But for the first quarter, Silicon Motion expects 7% to 14% annual sales growth, which missed the consensus estimate for 20% growth. CEO Wallace Kou attributes that slowdown to tightening supplies of NAND chips, which store data in the company's Shannon and Ferri SSDs. Kou noted that sales of its SSD controllers wouldn't be affected, but the company's broad 2017 sales forecast for flat to 10% growth indicates that its top line growth could be lumpy this year.However, Silicon Motion's soft first quarter guidance is great news for Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), one of the largest NAND suppliers in the world. Let's take a look at why Silicon Motion's pain could generate big gains for Micron this year.What does Micron Technology do?Micron is the fourth largest maker of NAND chips and the third largest maker of mobile DRAM chips in the world. Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) is the top player in both markets. Up until last quarter, Micron's revenues had declined annually for six straight quarters, due to sluggish PC shipments, the commoditization of the smartphone market, and a global glut of NAND and DRAM chips driving down prices. That waning cyclical demand caused Micron stock to plummet from the mid-$30s in late 2014 to less than $10 last May.But there are clear signs that supplies are tightening up and prices are rising. Last August, HP CEO Dion Weisler warned about shortages of memory chips across the industry. In December, Trendforce's DRAMeXchange noted that rising smartphone shipments, higher demand for SSDs, and the increase in the average memory density of eMMCs and eMCPs were all causing a global shortage of chips. The firm estimated that the NAND shortage would cause prices of SSDs and eMMCs to rise ""by over 10%"" sequentially in the first quarter of 2017 -- which is now reflected in Silicon Motion's first quarter guidance.Investors are already bullish on MicronSilicon Motion's weak guidance shouldn't have surprised investors who were watching the memory chip market. While the confirmation of tightening supplies is a positive development for Micron, investors are likely wondering if that optimism has already been baked in given the stock's 120% rally over the past 12 months.Analysts currently expect Micron's revenue to rise 42% this year, compared to a 23% decline last year. Its non-GAAP earnings are expected to soar from $0.06 last year to $2.42 on stronger sales and pricing power. Based on these estimates, Micron trades at just 9 times forward earnings.But mind the headwinds...However, there are also some major headwinds on the horizon. Samsung, Toshiba, and Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) SanDisk could hurt Micron in the NAND market with their superior scale. Toshiba owns a NAND joint venture with WD, but it could soon sell its stake to WD to offset steep losses at its nuclear power division -- making WD a dangerous foe for Samsung and Micron. Samsung and SK Hynix could apply similar pressure on Micron in the mobile DRAM market. Lastly, Micron has warned that Chinese chipmakers could flood the market with cheap memory chips in the near future.To widen its moat against these rivals, Micron has developed next-gen memory technologies like 3D NAND and 3DXpoint with its longtime partner Intel. It's also acquired smaller memory chipmakers like Inotera Memories to grow its market share.The key takeawayThe memory chip market is a notoriously fickle and cyclical one, so investors shouldn't simply assume that tightening demand and rising prices will lift Micron stock to fresh highs. But if Micron can stay ahead of the tech curve and keep growing inorganically, I believe that its shares could keep rising this year. "
Why Seagate Technology Plc Stock Is Soaring Today,"Jan 25, 2017 at 1:23PM","What happenedShares of Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) jumped as much as 24% higher on Wednesday following the release of surprisingly strong second-quarter earnings.So whatAnalysts were expecting earnings of roughly $1.08 per share on revenue near $2.8 billion. Instead, the hard drive maker delivered adjusted earnings of $1.38 per share on $2.9 billion in top-line sales. Unit sales volumes declined as usual, but Seagate saw the product mix leaning heavily into the more profitable enterprise segment. Moreover, earnings guidance for calendar year 2017 was lifted from $2.50 to $4.50 per share.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Now whatSeagate is firing on all cylinders at the moment, and management expects the good times to roll at least into 2018. That's why the stock is trading at fresh 52-week highs today.On the other hand, the company still lacks a clear strategy to either enter or counter the rising tide of solid-state storage devices. If left unchecked, this trend could ride declining memory chip prices all the way into the bulk storage market, where Seagate holds its greatest sway these days. Archrival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), who is reporting results after the closing bell tonight, addressed this issue by acquiring solid-state storage specialist SanDisk last year. If Seagate was hoping for a quick pick-me-up by acquiring a small solid-state specialist, it's probably too late. There are no obvious pure-play SSD options left.Western Digital's report should provide more clarity on the state of the storage market.

"Better Buy: Micron Technology, Inc. vs. Cypress Semiconductor","May 4, 2017 at 6:40PM","Chipmakers Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY) both fared well over the past 12 months, with the former's 160% rally and the latter's 60% gain outpacing the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index's 50% growth.But after those big gains, does either stock have more room to run this year? Let's take a closer look at their business models, growth trajectories, challenges, and valuations to find out.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.What do Micron and Cypress do?Micron is the third largest mobile DRAM maker and fourth largest NAND manufacturer in the world. However, the company is often considered the best ""pure play"" on the memory-chip market, since bigger rivals such as Samsung and Western Digital have more diversified businesses.To keep pace with the technological advances of those bigger competitors, Micron is developing next-gen memory technologies such as 3D NAND and 3DXPoint with Intel. It's also been beefing up by acquiring smaller memory-chip makers.Cypress produces programmable semiconductors for the automotive, industrial, home-automation, medical-device, and consumer-electronics markets. It relies heavily on acquisitions to expand its portfolio -- that's why it merged with embedded-chip maker Spansion in 2015, and then acquired Broadcom's (NASDAQ:AVGO) Internet of Things (IoT) business in 2016.Cypress also benefited from the shift across the mobile market toward USB-C connectors, since the company is a leading producer of USB-C power delivery chips. Some analysts believe that Apple may switch to the USB-C standard for the iPhone 8, but those rumors are unconfirmed.How fast are Micron and Cypress growing?Micron posted double-digit annual sales growth over the past two quarters, which broke a six-quarter streak of consecutive declines. That reversal was attributed to tightening memory-chip supplies across the market, which caused prices -- which had slumped for about two years -- to rise again.That's why Wall Street expects Micron's revenue to rise 58% to $19.6 billion this year, compared with a 23% decline in 2016. Its earnings are expected to surge from $0.06 in 2016 to $4.28 per share. That growth is expected to continue, with 8% sales growth and 20% earnings growth in 2018.Cypress, which serves a less cyclical market than Micron, posted positive year-over-year sales growth for 10 straight quarters. Much of that growth can be attributed to its acquisitions, but its core business has also been bolstered by its robust growth in microcontroller and connectivity division revenue, as well as strong demand in China and Japan.Analysts expect Cypress' revenue to rise 13% to $2.2 billion this year, compared with 19% growth last year. Its non-GAAP earnings, which more than doubled last year, are expected to rise another 43% this year. That momentum is expected to continue, albeit at a slightly slower pace, with 6% sales growth and 46% non-GAAP earnings growth next year. Cypress is unprofitable on a GAAP basis because of its aforementioned acquisitions.The headwinds and tailwindsMicron is riding high on rising memory prices, but it faces two main challenges. First, bigger memory-chip makers such as Samsung have superior scale and R&D capabilities -- which could force Micron to spend more heavily to keep pace. Second, Micron previously warned that Chinese chipmakers could flood the market with cheaper memory chips in the near future -- which would cause global prices to plunge.Cypress has benefited from the growth of the connected-car and industrial sectors. Those two markets accounted for 55% of the company's revenue in 2016, compared with just 30% in 2011. Buying Broadcom's IoT business also boosted its content share per connected car by 26% and helps the company address the connectivity needs of the growing IoT market.The main threat for Cypress is that other bigger chipmakers, such as Texas Instruments, are also expanding into the same markets. That competition could force Cypress to spend more heavily on R&D and acquisitions to remain competitive. Unlike Micron, which doesn't pay a dividend, Cypress pays a hefty forward dividend yield of 3.1%.The valuations and the verdictMicron trades at 48 times earnings, which matches the industry average. Cypress trades at 29 times non-GAAP earnings, which is slightly higher than its industry average of 28. Both companies have comparable P/S ratios -- Micron trades at 2 times sales, while Cypress trades at 2.4 times sales.It's a close call in the end, but I think Cypress is a slightly better pick than Micron at current prices. Its business is less cyclical, its competitive threats seem lighter, its valuation seems more reasonable, and it pays a decent dividend. Micron is still a good growth stock, but it might be too volatile for many investors. 10 stocks we like better than Micron TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Micron Technology, Inc. Just Found Its Next CEO","Apr 29, 2017 at 12:00PM","In early February, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) CEO Mark Durcan announced his intention to retire. 12 weeks later, the memory chip maker has found its next leader.Former SanDisk CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, who traded that title for a board seat at Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) when the hard drive veteran acquired his company, is coming back to a top-shelf corner office. He'll officially start the job on May 8, with Durcan stepping down into an advisory role for the following three months.INCOMING MICRON CEO, SANJAY MEHROTRA. IMAGE SOURCE: SANDISK.How does Mehrotra compare to his predecessor?With the benefit of hindsight, Mehrotra's appointment must have firmed up long ago. He left Western Digital's board on February 9, one week after Micron started looking for a new CEO.""The time is right for me to evaluate the next challenge in my career,"" Mehrotra said in February.Durcan's rise to the CEO office was more chaotic. After serving as Micron's chief technical officer for many years, he took the COO title in 2007. As COOs often are groomed to take over the CEO job in due time, it's quite possible that may have been preparation for that final promotion. But Micron's hand was forced when Durcan's predecessor, company founder Steve Appleton, crashed his private plane and perished in 2012.Like Durcan, Mehrotra comes in with decades of experience, all nicely connected to the job of running Micron. Durcan took the insider route, rising through the company's ranks over three decades. Mehrotra's tack is very different, but SanDisk was both a direct competitor and occasional Micron customer for most of its existence.And if Durcan's degrees in chemical engineering prepared him for his career at Micron, Mehrotra's electrical engineering diplomas from Berkeley cut even closer to the heart of this company's operations. As a Micron shareholder, I'm thrilled to see a tradition of technical excellence sticking right at the core of its executive leadership.What's next?Micron investors embraced Mehrotra's appointment right away, lifting share prices more than 2% on Thursday. The stock has more than doubled over the last 52 weeks, as memory chip prices firmed up and stayed high for several quarters. From his SanDisk days, Mehrotra learned all there is to know about the pricing effects of supply and demand in the memory market.I honestly can't come up with a better CEO candidate for Micron. Today's stock surge is more than just a sigh of relief over the CEO uncertainty situation -- it's a vote of confidence in the new name.10 stocks we like better than Micron TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What to Expect From Marvell Technology Groupâ€™s Q4 and Fiscal 2017 Earnings,"Mar 1, 2017 at 11:38AM","IMAGE SOURCE: MARVELL TECHNOLOGY GROUP.Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ:MRVL) stock is up over 21% in the last six months, thanks to strong bottom line beats in the past two quarters. The company will look to maintain this momentum when it releases its fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results after the bell on March 2.Marvell has been restructuring its business to tap the potential of the Internet of Things and the cloud. It has dialed back its mobile presence and is now busy shutting down some additional non-core operations. These moves should have a positive impact on upcoming earnings -- here's what investors can expect on Thursday.How the numbers might lookWall Street expects Marvell revenue to drop 8% from the year-ago period to $565 million, in line with company guidance. As it turns out, analysts were originally looking for higher revenue of $594 million, but seasonal weakness in the storage business forced the company to bring the numbers down.Now, Marvell's storage business brings in half of its revenue, with Seagate and Western Digital accounting for about 30% of the top line. Last quarter, Western Digital shipped 6% fewer hard-disk drives (HDDs) year-over-year, while Seagate saw muted growth of just 2.5%.By comparison, inventory replenishments and higher demand drove Marvell's sequential storage revenue growth by 19% in the third quarter. This was powered by an increase in both Seagate and Western Digital's HDD shipments -- up 6% and 18%, respectively. As a result, muted HDD shipments during the December quarter will weigh on the company's revenue.But the weak revenue is not going to drag down earnings. Wall Street estimates that Marvell will clock earnings of $0.19 per share during the period, up from $0.11 per share last year, a sign that its restructuring efforts are succeeding.Marvell had decided to exit its mobile business back in Sept. 2015, so it could shift its focus toward opportunities in the Internet of Things, automotive, and networking markets. The company estimated that exiting the business would generate $170 million to $220 million in annualized operating cost reductions, completing the transition by the end of fiscal 2016. Therefore, the upcoming results will capture the complete effect of the mobile restructuring effort and should show strong earnings gains.As it turns out, Marvell has beaten earnings estimates by huge margins in three of the last four quarters as it moved away from the mobile business (its one miss was due to restructuring-related expenses):Fiscal QuarterActual EPSExpected EPSEarnings SurpriseQ4 2016$0.11$0.0922%Q1 2017$0.01$0.07(86%)Q2 2017$0.18$0.1164%Q3 2017$0.20$0.1267%DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCEWhat about the guidance?Undoubtedly, Marvell's storage business will have the biggest say in determining its guidance. The good news for investors is that both Seagate and Western Digital are expected to see a bump in their businesses.Seagate management expects revenue to climb 4.5% from last year to $2.7 billion in the ongoing quarter. Western Digital, meanwhile, will benefit from a pick-up in notebook shipments in both February and March, according to BMO Capital.The improving business scenario at two of its biggest customers will be a tailwind for Marvell. As it turns out, consensus forecasts pin fiscal 2018 first quarter revenue at $544 million. Though this is flat year-over-year, it marks a big improvement over the fourth quarter's projected decline.What's more, Marvell could log strong earnings growth in the new fiscal year as well. Last November, the company had announced that it will slash 900 jobs worldwide in a bid to consolidate its research and development work. More importantly, the R&D reduction won't have a major impact on revenue. The company points out that the affected R&D programs accounted for just 7% of revenue, but the move could reduce annual operating expenses by approximately $190 million, almost equal to the savings realized from shutting down the mobile business.The restructuring charges will amount to $90 million to $110 million this year. Marvell expects to complete the entire exercise within the first three quarters of fiscal 2018, so it should end up boosting earnings once again in fiscal 2018. Analysts seem to agree with this outlook as they project earnings to grow to $0.90 per share in the new fiscal year from $0.58 in the previous one.Marvell Technology investors, therefore, can be optimistic, and a strong earnings report should confirm that sentiment.10 stocks we like better than Marvell Technology GroupWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

HP Inc. Stock Upgraded: What You Need to Know,"Apr 13, 2017 at 8:00AM","Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...It's been a good couple of months for investors in personal computer parts suppliers. So far, we've seen shares of Micron, Seagate, and Western Digital -- all makers of computer solid state and hard disk drives -- upgraded with buy ratings. And the reasons Wall Street gives are encouraging: Demand is high and supplies are tightening for solid state memory. And that implies (and other data support the thesis) that demand for personal computers is finally stabilizing.Conclusion: The PC industry is coming back to life -- and according to Citigroup, that's good news for HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ).Here are three things you need to know about that.ARE PC SALES MAKING A COMEBACK? CITI -- AND HP INVESTORS -- HOPE SO. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.1. Upgrading HPYesterday, in an upgrade heard round the world, Citigroup announced it is raising its recommendation on HP stock from neutral to buy. As reported on TheFly.com yesterday, Citi sees ""better than expected PC data points"" and believes that HP's printer ink business is also beginning to stabilize.This could lead analysts to revise their earnings targets for HP stock higher, which would naturally result in a higher stock price as well. Citi estimates HP could hit $20 within a year -- about an 11% improvement from the current stock price. Tack on a respectable 3.1% dividend yield, and that makes for a potential 14% profit for new buyers of HP stock.2. More profits, more market shareAnd that's not all. Digging deeper into Citi's analysis of HP stock, StreetInsider.com says that not only is the PC market improving, but HP is capturing a bigger share of that market. Combining improved profit margins with more sales, Citi argues that HP could earn as much as $1.64 per share this year ($0.05 more than previously postulated). This could be followed by earnings of $1.75 in 2018, and perhaps $1.79 in 2019, if all goes well.Thus, HP's current stock price of $18 and change values the company at roughly 10 times 2019 earnings -- and to Citigroup, that's good enough to merit a buy rating. On the other hand, given that even Citi is only predicting about 4% to 5% annualized sales growth for HP, investors may wonder if HP stock is really worth paying 10 times earnings two years out -- earnings that may or may not happen. (For the record, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, most analysts think HP will only be earning $1.60 in 2019.)3. Trouble in paradiseAnd for that matter, is business really as good as Citigroup says? Not all experts think so. For example, earlier this week, tech-watcher Gartner published a report that shows worldwide PC shipments declining 2.4% year over year in Q1. Gartner noted, furthermore, that this was the first time PC makers shipped fewer than 63 million units in a full quarter -- since 2007!Fact is, Gartner reports that the only segment of the PC market that is growing today is purchases of PCs by businesses -- and even this growth is only ""modest."" Consumer purchases of personal computers continue to decline, as individuals make do with older PCs rather than upgrading to fancier versions. At the same time, some consumers, says Gartner, have abandoned PCs altogether, and do their computing today on tablets and smartphones instead.What it means for investorsGartner's conclusion doesn't necessarily contradict Citigroup's upgrade of HP stock, but it does refine it a bit -- and this could be important for investors to bear in mind. Says Gartner, with consumer sales growth nonexistent, ""maintaining a strong position in the business market"" is what will be ""critical"" for PC makers. Emphasizing the point, Gartner believes PC industry investing may become less a matter of finding ""winners,"" and more one of just finding ""survivors.""Who will those survivors be? Gartner argues that only the top three vendors of PCs have much of a chance of coming out of this downturn alive. That means Lenovo in China, privately held Dell, and -- the only one of the three that's actually easy to invest in -- HP. Unless PC sales suddenly and magically improve, everyone else, warns Gartner, could be forced out of the PC market ""in the next five years.""So what's the upshot for investors? Gartner believes HP will be one of only a small handful of survivors remaining in the PC market five years from now. That may be enough to merit a buy rating, if you believe Citi's prediction of 4% to 5% growth -- and if that's fast enough growth for you.For me, it's not, and that's why I'll be passing on this particular buy recommendation.10 stocks we like better than HPWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The 5 Top-Producing Gold Mines in the World,"Apr 28, 2017 at 6:01AM","IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.For thousands of years -- since ancient Egypt -- people have been digging gold out of the ground, and it likely will continue to be highly valued for many years to come.Around the world, people have found places to sink their shovels and satisfy their appetites for the yellow stuff. But what are the largest mines producing gold today? The answers may surprise you.THE CORTEZ MINE IN NEVADA. IMAGE SOURCE: BARRICK GOLD.5. Cortez Located in Nevada, the Cortez mine produced 1.059 million ounces of gold in 2016 -- about 6% more than its gold production from 2015. One of Barrick Gold's (NYSE:ABX) core mines, Cortez has proven-and-probable gold reserves of 10.2 million ounces as of December 31, 2016. Presumably, Cortez will stay among the largest producing gold mines for the foreseeable future -- management estimates gold production between 1.25 million and 1.29 million ounces in 2017.Besides a rise in production, Barrick reported several other successes at the mine in 2016. For one, the company reduced all-in sustaining costs (AISC) by 14% year over year, to $518 per ounce. This, in part, contributed to an increase in profitability compared to 2015.According to Barrick, the mine generated 18% more income and 33% more in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Additionally, the company has numerous projects in development focused on mine expansion, ensuring gold production will continue for many years to come.One of the more interesting aspects of Cortez is that it's the focus of a collaboration between Barrick and Cisco Systems . Working to digitize the operation, Barrick and Cisco will employ predictive data and analytics, among other things, to further reduce costs, illustrating how the mining industry stands to benefit from the advancement in digital technologies.THE GRASBERG MINE LOCATED IN INDONESIA. IMAGE SOURCE: FREEPORT MCMORAN.4. GrasbergJointly owned by Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) and the government of Indonesia, the Grasberg minerals district is comprised of three operating mines, which, together, produced 1.061 million ounces of gold in 2016. One of the largest gold deposits in the world, Grasberg has recoverable proven-and-probable gold reserves of 25.8 million ounces. Accounting for 98% of Freeport-McMoRan gold production in 2016, Grasberg generated $1.03 billion in operating income for fiscal 2016 -- about 32% of the total operating income that the company reported from mining operations.It's questionable -- at best -- whether the mine will appear on the list of the largest gold-producing mines in 2017. The company halted operations at the mine in February, due to a disagreement with the Indonesian government regarding concentrate exports and other issues. According to the company's press release, ""For each month of delay in obtaining approval to export, [the company's] share of production is projected to be reduced by approximately 70 million pounds of copper and 70 thousand ounces of gold.""Prior to the suspension of operations, the company had been engaged in numerous mine-expansion activities, which the company had forecast to total $1 billion in annual capital expenditures from 2017 through 2021.THE GOLDSTRIKE MINE LOCATED IN NEVADA. IMAGE SOURCE: BARRICK GOLD.3. GoldstrikeFor the second time, Barrick Gold appears on the list of the top gold-producing mines. This time, it's because of its ownership of the Goldstrike mine -- another of Barrick's core mines. Like Cortez, Goldstrike is located in the Carlin Trend, which Barrick recognizes as ""the most prolific gold mining district in the Western Hemisphere.""In 2016, Goldstrike produced 1.096 million ounces of gold -- a 4% year-over-year increase -- due, in part, to higher autoclave production. The coming year is not expected to be as productive, though. Management forecasts gold production between 910,000 to 950,000 ounces. However, that's not to say that the future is losing its luster: Goldstrike has 8.08 million ounces in proven and probable gold reserves. Although the company reported a 9% year-over-year increase in AISC, this didn't adversely affect profitability -- Goldstrike reported year-over-year increases of 8% in income and 25% increase in EBITDA. In the years to come, the profitability should improve further as the company unifies operations at Goldstrike with Cortez. On the company's fourth-quarter conference call, management suggested the unification of operations would ideally ""secure at least $100 an ounce of [Barrick's] combined all-in sustaining cost there on a consistent and sustainable basis, primarily due to better planning and capital allocation and enhanced business improvement execution, including the implementation of digital systems.""According to Barrick, there's plenty of gold left to strike at Goldstrike. In the company's 40-F filling, the company reported ""the expected remaining mine life at Goldstrike extends to 2023 for underground mining, to 2027 for open pit mining and to 2032 for processing operations.""THE PROCESS PLANT SITE AT PUEBLO VIEJO WHERE GOLD, SILVER AND COPPER WILL BE PROCESSED. IMAGE SOURCE: BARRICK GOLD.2. Pueblo ViejoLocated in the Dominican Republic, Pueblo Viejo is a joint venture between Barrick Gold, which retains a 60% interest, and Goldcorp (NYSE:GG), which retains the remaining 40% interest. Pueblo Viejo, an open pit mine, accounted for 1.167 million ounces of gold in 2016.Between Barrick's share and Goldcorp's share, Pueblo Viejo has proven-and-probable gold reserves of approximately 13.48 million ounces. In addition to Barrick and Goldcorp, Royal Gold also has an interest in Pueblo Viejo. In September 2015, Barrick signed a gold and silver streaming transaction with Royal Gold linked to Barrick's 60% interest in the mine.Another of Barrick's core mines, Pueblo Viejo, remains a vital part of its portfolio. The mine holds a prominent position in Goldcorp's portfolio, as well. The company recognizes Pueblo Viejo as playing a key role in its goal of growing gold reserves by 20% over the next five years.THE DORMITION CATHEDRAL IN TASHKENT, UZBEKISTAN. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.1. MuruntauLike Barry Bonds' home-run record, Muruntau, the world's top gold-producing mine in 2016, comes with an asterisk. The Muruntau mine is owned by the Uzbekistani government, which is not very forthcoming when it comes to information relating to its mine. Nonetheless, according to mining.com, Muruntau produced approximately 2.15 million ounces of gold in 2014 and 2015. Presuming it produced a comparable amount, the mine retains the title of the top gold-producing mine in the world. In fact, its gold production would have to be nearly cut in half for it to fall behind Pueblo Viejo.Muruntau is the world's largest open-pit mine, by area, and the world's fifth deepest. Again, due to the absence of free-flowing information, it's difficult to be certain, but some estimates place Muruntau's gold reserves as high as 170 million ounces.10 stocks we like better than Freeport-McMoRan IncWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Biggest Opportunities for Nike Inc.,"Feb 15, 2017 at 2:00PM","Nike (NYSE:NKE) had a rough 2016. Its stock fell 18% throughout the year, as Wall Street worried about its future growth prospects amid a changing consumer market and stiff competition from Under Armour (NYSE:UAA)(NYSE:UA) and a resurgent Adidas (NASDAQOTH:ADDYY). Things have started to turn around for Nike in 2017, already one of the best-performing large-cap stocks of the year, and it could get much better from here. The company has many growth opportunities ahead of it, but these three look like some of the most interesting now.IMAGE SOURCE: NIKE INC.Continued international growthNike already gets more than half of its sales from outside the country, but it could still grow further internationally. Nike's sales in China jumped 17% year over year in the quarter when adjusted for currency fluctuations, and the company believes that's just getting started. ""The Greater China marketplace continues to be fueled by higher sports participation, with 38,000 runners taking part in the Shanghai marathon, while nearly four times that many consumers tried to sign up,"" said Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards in the most recent earnings call. Western Europe, which is Nike's biggest international segment, has been another outstanding region lately. That might seem odd, given the region's own relatively slow growth, but sales in Western Europe grew 12% year over year, the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth there. Of course, Adidas is a powerhouse in Europe, particularly in soccer. Nike is facing that situation head-on, and as Edwards said during the call, ""With the start of our new relationship with Chelsea Football Club next season, our brand is Europe is only getting stronger."" Digital investmentsNike famously killed its wearable segment and strategy in 2014, but it hasn't stopped investing in digital growth. Nike's focus now is on increasing its digital sales strategy to drive sales through Nike.com. Online sales have multiple benefits, including the ability to meet more customers who might not be in a Nike store or third-party retailer, and Nike also gets to keep all of that valuable information about the customer. In addition, it has the benefit of higher gross margin by allowing Nike to create customized gear and other higher-priced items, as well as keep the full sale rather than letting a percentage go to a third-party retailer. Nike.com sales nearly doubled year over year in the most recent quarter. Nike announced that in fiscal 2016, Nike.com went live in 20 additional countries, doubling from a year ago, which should help that international expansion as more of those localized online stores go live in 2017. The company has also made advancements in connecting its digital strategy to its new concept physical locations. The first of that concept -- the massive new Soho New York location -- integrates mobile check-in and shopping features, as well as touchscreens on the walls to allow consumers to order and ship gear home if they prefer. NIKE+ MOBILE APP. IMAGE SOURCE: NIKE INC.Nike also launched a Nike+ smartphone app last summer. It has a social media-like feed, customized content around fitness and Nike-sponsored athletes, a feature for booking appointments at Nike stores and events, and, most importantly, it has a mobile shopping section that gives users tailored recommendations and alerts for new items that are dropping. This is just one more way the company is looking to meet its customers where they are and grow its online sales strategy further.   Manufacturing revolutionNike management has started to hype up what it refers to in the most recent earnings call as ""Man Rev,"" which is short for ""manufacturing revolution."" From the earnings call and elsewhere in the company's releases, we know that this is a focus on innovative materials, assembly procedures, and advancements with interesting technology such as 3D printing that the company believes will overhaul the ways its products are made in the years to come. There are a few reasons this could be a huge opportunity for the company and its future earnings. Part of the reason Nike had such a rough 2016 was that its gross margin continued to fall throughout the year because of higher-priced input goods and inventory challenges that led to reduced prices to get product cleared out. Innovation in terms of the materials used, and also the speed with which new products can get from concept to market -- an initiative the company is calling Express Lane -- could help on both fronts.  Many companies are looking at manufacturing and supply chain and how investments in those areas could drive new growth in the years ahead. Under Armour launched a manufacturing innovation center in Baltimore in 2016 called Lighthouse, which features 3D printers, body scanners, and other technology. The company recently launched the first true product of that center, a line of women's wear called UA Arris Project. Nike hasn't given a lot of insight into the specifics of its Man Rev, but investors can probably expect to learn more in the earnings calls to come. Nike's drop in 2016 was certainly a shock, but it could also have provided a great opportunity. For long-term bulls who believe all these initiatives and other big growth opportunities can move the stock back to where it was in late 2015 and higher, Nike continues to look like a great long-term play.10 stocks we like better than NikeWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"What Jewelry Brands Cartier, Tiffany, and Pandora Are Doing in China","Apr 19, 2017 at 4:24PM","China is becoming more important for Western jewelry brands. With over a billion people and a growing middle class, China is the world's largest jewelry market, at an estimated $103 billion, representing one third of global jewelry sales, and is growing quickly. The Chinese market is estimated to grow 7% through 2020, compared with only 3% for North America and 1% for Europe.Three Western brands -- Tiffany, (NYSE:TIF); Cartier, which is part of Richemont (NASDAQOTH:CFRHF); and Pandora A/S (NASDAQOTH:PANDY) , are all looking east for growth, and going about it in different ways. Let's dig in. IMAGE SOURCE: CARTIER.CartierCartier is part of Richemont's ""jewelry houses"" segment, which also includes Van Cleef & Arpels and Giampiero Bodino. Jewelry houses are Richemont's largest segment, at 55% of sales. Moreover, its non-watch jewelry segment was the highest-growth category for the company.  .In its 2016 annual report, Richemont's management highlighted China as a key growth market, up 26% year over year, which offset weakness in Hong Kong and Macau. Chinese and Hong Kong sales made up 22% of Richemont's revenue last year. .Cartier is making a significant move by putting a virtual storefront on China's WeChat. While it might seem odd for a luxury brand to put a storefront on a messaging app, L2 research recently called WeChat, owned by Chinese internet giant Tencent (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY), ""the most important platform for luxury brands"" in China today, as reported by the Financial Times. While the service is a mere 5 years old, WeChat boasts 850 million monthly active users. Many of the local jewelry players, such as Chow Tai Fook, already have storefronts on the site. Tiffany & Co.Tiffany is currently struggling with worldwide sales, though it still points to China as an engine of growth. While its Asia-Pacific region reported a slight decline in 2016, this was due mainly to declines in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and Australia. CEO Michael Kowalski said on the recent Q4 conference call, ""We certainly see ... Mainland China opportunity as continuing to be very, very significant. Again, the brand is still in its early -- relatively early stages of development in that market."" Tiffany opened three stores in China in 2016, but closed two others, taking its total to 31. China represents roughly 13% of total Tiffany sales.While Tiffany uses WeChat for marketing, it has not embraced a WeChat storefront yet, as Cartier has. This may be due to a desire to preserve the exclusive appeal of Tiffany's store experience. Chinese fashion blogger Hazel Meng was quoted by the Financial Times as saying this is a mistake. She pointed to simple, silver Tiffany bracelets as an example that could succeed on a digital store as many young Chinese are looking toward Western brands with ""a little heritage"" and buying online is preferred. Brands that are reluctant to embrace e-commerce and meet customers where they want to shop could be putting themselves at risk. Tiffany investors should monitor the company's China digital strategy going forward. Pandora One brand that does things differently is Pandora A/S, which makes those trendy, silver charm bracelets. Pandora entered China in 2011 and already has over 100 stores there. Last fall, Pandora opened its e-commerce site in China, as well as its own storefront on Tmall, a WeChat rival. While Pandora aims its marketing at middle-age women in the U.S., it has gone after the 25-35-year-old demographic in China by partnering with celebrities such as actress Ivy Chen.""The launch of PANDORA jewellery on Tmall.com is another important step in establishing the PANDORA brand amongst Chinese consumers. Tmall is a clear leader in China's internet retail space, and is the right business partner for PANDORA to get the broadest approach to the Chinese consumer,"" Kenneth Madsen, president, Pandora Asia Pacific, was quoted as saying in an October 2016 press release. Chinese sales increased 175% in 2016, with same-store sales in the fourth quarter of 44%.Despite China representing one-third of the global jewelry market, it is still only 4%-5% of Pandora sales, which means there seems to be a long way to go for Pandora in China.How are they doing?Which of these brands are doing China right? For me, the clear winner is Pandora, due to its incredible growth, though this could be because it appeals to a different mass-market segment.Second place is Cartier, showing the second-best Chinese growth of the three, and boldly moving forward with its WeChat storefront.Tiffany is last, but not out. Should the company choose to be less guarded about its brand and embrace e-commerce to a greater extent, its prospects in China may catch up with the others.10 stocks we like better than Tiffany & Co.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Dividend Stock Winners,"Apr 14, 2017 at 7:55AM","Buying and holding solid dividend stocks is one of the most effective ways for investors to predictably generate wealth and beat the market over the long term. But it's not always easy to separate the best dividend stocks from the those that are destined to underperform the rest.To help you get started, we asked three top Motley Fool contributors to pick one dividend stock winner they believe investors would be wise to purchase. Read on to learn why they chose Nike (NYSE:NKE), Enviva Partners LP (NYSE:EVA), and Altria Group (NYSE:MO).IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.A perfect pause for long-term investorsSteve Symington (Nike): Nike stock may have plunged 7% after its latest quarterly report a few weeks ago, but I still think the athletic apparel and footwear giant is a compelling portfolio candidate for patient, long-term investors.For perspective, Nike's revenue last quarter climbed a modest 5% year over year, to $8.432 billion, while net income per share climbed nearly 24%, to $0.68. Those results were mixed relative to Wall Street's expectations, which called for earnings of just $0.53 per share on higher revenue of $8.47 billion. Nike's shortfall on the top line was primarily driven by a well-documented slowdown and highly promotional environment in North America.But Nike also delivered double-digit growth in Western Europe, Greater China, and its emerging markets segment. And Nike CEO Mark Parker views the slowdown as a chance to solidify his company's industry leadership.""While we are mindful of these near-term dynamics, we remain focused on the long term,"" Parker explained. ""The current backdrop represents a tremendous opportunity for Nike, because the brands that win are going to be the ones that have been out front with digital and leading with service.""In the meantime, investors willing to buy and hold can benefit from Nike's ambitious capital-returns initiatives. The company not only pays a healthy dividend that yields 1.3% annually, but also has around $8.4 billion remaining under its four-year, $12 billion repurchase program that was initially approved in late 2015.An uber-high dividend yield that doesn't seem too good to be trueBrian Stoffel (Enviva Partners LP): One of the most intriguing dividend stocks that I'm currently following is Enviva Partners LP. The company processes wood pellets -- which seems like a pretty innocuous business -- until you realize that they have become one of the leading inputs for energy companies in Northern European countries that are trying to wean themselves off of coal.Enviva -- with operations primarily in the American Southeast -- was a first mover in the industry. This helped it to acquire production plants and buy deep-water docks on the East Coast that have continually helped cut costs and move the profit-margin needle in shareholders' favor.Management believes that it can pay out $2.35 in dividends in 2017, giving it a current yield of 8.3%. That dividend is protected on a number of fronts: The company has long-term offtake contracts with power companies that help guarantee revenue. The average weighted length of those contracts is just under a decade.While management hopes to have a coverage ratio of 1.15 on its dividend -- equivalent to a free-cash-flow payout ratio of 87% -- last year's dividend featured a coverage ratio of 1.28. In other words, only 78% of the company's distributable cash flow was used to pay its outsized dividend.That type of operating leverage and safety via long-term contracts helps explain why the stock has been a real winner since October 2015, returning over 160% to shareholders.This stock is lighting upDan Caplinger (Altria Group): It's hard to find a dividend stock that has outperformed Altria Group over the long run. For more than a half-century, the tobacco giant has found ways to deliver above-average dividends, while also giving investors impressive total-return performance. The stock remains one of the best in terms of share-price appreciation over the decades, and recently, Altria has continued to post new highs.Much of Altria's success has come from defying investor skepticism about its sustainability. For years, many believed that Altria would fall prey to destructive litigation that would make the entire cigarette business a thing of the past. Yet time and time again, Altria fought back plaintiffs and avoided the crushing blow that many had expected. Meanwhile, depressed share prices led to outsized dividend yields that rewarded those who stayed the course.Now, many of Altria's legal threats are behind it, yet the company still faces opposition from high taxes, adverse consumer groups, and restrictive regulation. Yet with strong pricing power from its Marlboro brand, Altria has been able to keep revenue and profits growing despite falling volume. With a yield that still puts the overall market to shame, Altria remains a valuable dividend stock that also has the potential to see further growth in the future.10 stocks we like better than Altria GroupWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Stocks That Could Put Amazon.com's Returns to Shame,"May 24, 2017 at 9:30AM","Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) gradual evolution from a small online bookseller to a titan of the digital retail space has produced staggering returns on capital, especially for the brave few who were smart to enough to grab shares early in the company's metamorphosis. However, these types of rocket-fueled growth stocks are exceedingly difficult to spot, even during the middle of their radical transformation into giants of their respective industries.Given the herculean task of unearthing growth stocks capable of matching -- or perhaps exceeding -- Amazon's jaw-dropping ascension, we turned to three of our contributors for their thoughts. They suggested that Organovo Holdings (NASDAQ:ONVO), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Snap (NYSE:SNAP)might all turn out to be Amazon's equal or even its superior down the road. Read on to find out why. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.This speculative tissue engineering company could one day revolutionize drug discovery and developmentGeorge Budwell (Organovo Holdings): If you're hunting for stocks that can outperform Amazon's ginormous return on capital, look for companies developing potentially game-changing technologies. Organovo Holdings, a 3-D bioprinting company, may be one of those companies. Organovo hopes its 3-D bioprinted tissues can become an essential part of the drug discovery and development process. The selling point is that tens of billions of dollars are wasted each year on experimental drugs that fail to perform as expected once human trials commence. Around 90% of cancer drugs fail to reach the market, and Alzheimer's disease drug candidates have a humbling failure rate of 99%.  Organovo's technology, in theory, could streamline the drug discovery and development processes by allowing clinicians to assess the efficacy and safety of experimental compounds on human tissues in the lab. The problem -- and it's a big one -- is that Organovo's business model is predicated on a tectonic shift in how drugs are developed in the United States and other Western nations. And that's not going to be easy, despite the well-known inefficiencies in the current system that directly contributes to the sky-high prices of new drugs. If Organovo can persuade pharma companies and regulators alike to shift toward bioprinted human tissues early in the discovery process, this small-cap company has the potential to generate astronomical returns on capital. Organovo, after all, is staring down a commercial opportunity that might be as high as $50 billion per year. The downside is that this biotech is quickly running out of cash, and there's no clear indication that its bold business model will ultimately pan out. Just scratching the surfaceTim Brugger (Facebook): Finding a stock with the potential to outpace Amazon is a tall order, in part because fundamental analysis gets thrown out the window. But at some point, valuation and rapidly increasing profitability will become factors, and when they do, Facebook is a name that practically can't miss.After reporting yet another stellar quarter, Facebook is enjoying a 28% share-price jump this year, comparable to Amazon's year-to-date rise. At nearly $412 billion in market capitalization, Facebook's size puts it in the same ballpark as Amazon. However, Facebook is continuing to grow like an upstart.Amazon's sales increased 23% last quarter -- nothing to sneeze at. But Facebook's revenue, keeping in mind that the two industry stalwarts are nearly the same size, more than doubled that of Amazon's, soaring 49% to $8 billion.The best part of Facebook's growth is that it's just scratching the surface. Instagram is already a social-media force in its own right, let alone a revenue-generating machine, along with both WhatsApp and Messenger, which each boast over 1 billion monthly average users. Facebook's skyrocketing growth is poised to continue for years to come.Again, fundamentals aren't necessarily relevant in the case of Amazon, but its forward price-to-earnings ratio is 122, while Facebook has every bit as many growth opportunities, if not more, and is trading at just 29 times future earnings. Toss in a 76% jump in per-share earnings to $1.04 last quarter, and Facebook could eventually put Amazon to shame.To travel fast, one must travel lightRich Smith (Snap): Anniversaries are for celebrating, and with Amazon.com turning 20 this week, there's good reason for investors to cheer the stock's 4,900-fold return on investment over the past two decades. As The Wall Street Journal  put it, ""a $10,000 investment in Amazon.com [at its IPO] 20 years ago would be worth $4.9 million today.""That return worked out to about 36% annually, every year, for 20 years straight. And the fact that Amazon stock isn't even slowing down -- growing 38% in price over the past year alone -- is simply astounding. What would it take for another stock to put Amazon's returns to shame, then?For that, I think you'd need a company with an even lighter business model than Amazon boasts -- a business not weighed down by Amazon's need to store and ship physical goods, and to build warehouses to hold them, robots to load them, and airplanes to carry them. A business composed primarily of composed of ones and zeros. In short, an entirely online business like Snap.Last year, Amazon spent $6.7 billion  on capital expenditures. Snap got by on just $66.4 million -- less than 1% of Amazon's capital spending. With such light capital requirements, analysts expect Snap to grow its profit at the rate of 70% annually over the next five years, versus less than 40% for Amazon.Granted, much of this growth lies far in the future. Snap isn't even profitable yet, while Amazon already is -- and wildly so. Still, if Snap achieves net profitability by 2019, as analysts predict, and nearly quintuples its profits by 2020, as they also predict, then a goal of 70% average annual growth may not be as far-fetched as it sounds, even after Snap turns the corner toward real profits.While I can't say for certain that Snap will achieve those profits, or that it will put Amazon's returns to shame, if there's anyone that can do it, I think it will have to be a business like Snap.

Should You Sell Western Digital After its Toshiba Loss?,"Oct 20, 2017 at 8:30AM","Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) lengthy attempt to acquire Toshiba's (NASDAQOTH:TOSBF) memory unit failed last month, with Toshiba deciding to sell the unit to a consortium led by SK Hynix and Bain Capital.Western Digital previously inherited a NAND flash memory joint venture with Toshiba through its $15.8 billion acquisition of SanDisk. But shortly after the SanDisk takeover, Toshiba decided to sell its entire memory business to offset losses at its US nuclear division.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.WD opposed the sale, stating that it violated the contractual agreements of the Sandisk joint venture. Toshiba, which stated that WD lacked the capital for a full buyout, sued WD for interfering with the deal. WD eventually assembled a consortium of companies to make a bid for the unit. However, its final bid of $17.4 billion still fell short of the $18 billion that SK Hynix and Bain's consortium offered.That loss sparked several downgrades of WD from analysts, who noted that NAND prices were gradually peaking and WD's own NAND supply faced an uncertain future. So is it finally time to sell Western Digital after its near-60% run over the past 12 months? Or does this data storage stock still have room to run?Why Western Digital needed Toshiba's memory businessPrior to the SanDisk purchase, most of Western Digital's revenue came from sales of traditional platter-based HDDs (hard disk drives). However, HDDs have been gradually replaced by SSDs (solid-state drives), which use NAND flash memory chips instead of platters. NAND-based drives are smaller, faster, consume less power, and are less prone to damage because they don't have any moving parts.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) is the largest NAND chip maker in the world, with 35.6% market share during the second quarter. Toshiba and Western Digital, each of which has a 17.5% share, are tied at second place. Micron controls 12.9% of the market, SK Hynix controls 9.9%, and Intel controls 6.6%.If WD had completely acquired Toshiba's memory business, it could have challenged Samsung for first place. But under the terms of WD's consortium bid, it would have only maintained an 8% stake without any voting rights. That would only have slightly boosted its market share, but it would still have become the second largest NAND maker in the world.But now SK Hynix will step up and claim a large portion of that business, which could help it overtake Micron and challenge WD's SanDisk with scaled-up operations. Meanwhile, Gartner predicts that NAND prices -- which are already posting slower year-over-year gains -- will eventually crash in 2019 due to the cyclical nature of the market.But Western Digital and Toshiba could still work togetherBack in July, a California court ruled that Toshiba needed to give SanDisk a two-week notice before closing any transfer of its joint venture interests. Shortly after it lost the Toshiba bid, Western Digital also filed for arbitration against Toshiba through the ICC International Court of Arbitration, claiming that Toshiba shouldn't invest in a new flash memory production line unless SanDisk is allowed to participate.Toshiba is apparently willing to give WD a chance. It recently announced that it was discussing a joint investment in a new chip production line with WD, which could mend some fences between the two companies. During a news conference, Yasuo Naruke, the head of Toshiba's flash memory unit, stated that it was best to maintain ""amicable ties"" with SanDisk as the two companies both compete against Samsung.So should you sell Western Digital?Analysts expect WD's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 6% and 35% this year, with robust sales of SanDisk's NAND products offsetting softer sales of its namesake HDDs. However, WD is now upgrading its traditional HDDs with new features, like MAMR (microwave-assisted magnetic recording) tech which lets HDDs cram in more bits at the same price. Those high-density drives could prove popular in data centers which can't afford to upgrade all their HDDs to pricier SSDs.WD trades at just seven times next year's earnings, while its closest rival Seagate trades at 10 times forward earnings. WD also pays a forward dividend yield of 2.3%.That low valuation and decent dividend should limit WD's downside potential -- even after its spectacular run over the past year -- while new technologies like MAMR and a mended relationship with Toshiba could clear up concerns about its HDD and SSD businesses. Therefore, I think investors shouldn't sell WD, since it could still have more room to run.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Western Digital Q1: Higher Profits and a Seemingly Endless Legal Fight,"Nov 1, 2017 at 10:31AM","Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) released results for its inaugural quarter of fiscal 2018 on Oct. 26, and they were encouraging, even if the top- and bottom-line beats weren't overpowering. The computer storage specialist also provided an update about its ongoing legal dispute with business partner Toshiba (NASDAQOTH:TOSBF).It seems that the market expected better, though. The company's shares fell slightly in after-hours trading following the unveiling of the results, though as of market close Oct. 31, shares were back to about where they were before earnings were reported. Let's look at how Western Digital did in the quarter.IMAGE SOURCE: WESTERN DIGITAL.The numbersFor Q1, WD posted revenue of $5.18 billion, which was 10% higher than in the same period last year. Net income was $681 million, a vast improvement over the year-ago quarter's $366 million loss. When adjusted for one-time items, the Q1 2018 bottom-line profit was $1.1 billion, or $3.56 per share. The Q1 2017 result for same was $341 million ($1.18).Those latest numbers were high enough to beat the average analyst estimates. On average, analysts were expecting $5.10 billion on the top line and adjusted earnings of $3.30 per share.WD is still benefiting from its acquisition of flash-memory maker SanDisk, which closed in May 2016. CEO Steve Milligan said that such products have had quite a positive effect on the company's cash position. ""We generated strong operating cash flow, reflecting continued healthy demand in many of our end markets, most notably in our flash-based businesses,"" he said during the conference call with analysts.That was the good news. There were two less inspiring items, though I wouldn't quite call them ""bad news."" First, Western Digital proffered revenue guidance that came in below analyst estimates. The company believes it will book $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion for the current, second quarter, which even at the top end would be below the average analyst forecast of $5.33 billion. On the other hand, the company's projected EPS of $3.60 to $3.70 handily beats the average prognostication of $3.51. Both metrics would represent notable growth from Q1 2017's results.Uninspiring item No. 2 was WD's update of the soap opera -- whoops, legal battle -- around the sale of Toshiba's memory-chip business. Western Digital has joint ventures with Toshiba and had worked to buy the business that Toshiba is selling. It objects to Toshiba's planned sale of the business to another consortium. My colleague Leo Sun does a fine job of digesting the saga.Milligan said in the conference call that ""the stakeholders will either engage in constructive dialogue in the near future, or this matter will be resolved through the objective arbitration process."" In other words, this disagreement is probably going to drag on for a good while. No flash in the panWD is in the right business at the right time. Demand for flash memory is strong, thanks to factors such as the increasing sophistication of smartphones, and the legacy hard-drive segment is hanging on better than it should given that it's an aging technology. Meanwhile, the company's weaker-than-expected guidance for Q3 isn't weak enough to abandon ship; it still represents healthy year-over-year growth, after all.What bothers me more, as a shareholder, is the situation with Toshiba. Although WD claims that it's willing to ""engage in constructive dialogue,"" its actions suggest otherwise.In offering participation in its upcoming Fab 6 chip-production line, Toshiba is at least trying to reach out to its American partner, but WD seems to be refusing even to consider this overture. Rather, it seems determined to wage a potentially costly fight that could drag on for years to the detriment of both it and Toshiba.But I'm hanging on to my shares. The world needs more storage, particularly of the flash variety, and WD is nicely positioned to sell it. The Q1 results didn't blow anyone away, but they gave this investor plenty of indication that both the company's fundamentals and its potential for future growth are strong."
Western Digital's Battle for Toshiba's Memory Finally Ends,"Sep 23, 2017 at 2:00PM","Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) lengthy battle over Toshiba's (NASDAQOTH:TOSBF) memory unit seemingly ended on Sep. 20, with Toshiba's board voting to sell the business to a consortium led by SK Hynix and Bain Capital for about $18 billion. Western Digital stated that it was ""disappointed"" in Toshiba's decision, and insisted that it violated contractual agreements with its subsidiary SanDisk.Previously on Western Digital vs. Toshiba...At the heart of this conflict is a NAND joint venture between Toshiba and SanDisk that Western Digital acquired for $15.8 billion last year. Shortly afterwards, Toshiba decided to sell its entire memory chip business to offset massive losses as its US nuclear division. WD opposed the sale, stating that it violated JV agreements between SanDisk and Toshiba. Toshiba then sued WD for allegedly interfering with the bidding process.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Western Digital couldn't purchase the entire memory unit on its own after the SanDisk deal, so it assembled a consortium to make an offer. That group included private equity firm KKR and the state-backed Network Corp. of Japan and Development Bank of Japan. The consortium's final bid was reportedly $17.4 billion, with WD offering $1.3 billion of that total in convertible bonds.However, two other rival consortiums emerged -- one led by SK Hynix and Bain, and another led by Foxconn. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which previously warned WD against interfering with the bid process, joined SK Hynix and Bain, which seemingly turned the tide against WD and Foxconn. The deal hasn't been finalized yet, but WD shares fell nearly 4% after the announcement.Why Western Digital investors were disappointedBefore acquiring SanDisk, Western Digital was primarily known as the world's largest manufacturer of traditional platter-based HDDs (hard disk drives). That market was gradually being cannibalized by pricier NAND-based SSDs (solid-state drives), which were faster, consumed less power, and were less prone to damage than HDDs.But after buying SanDisk, Western Digital became the third largest manufacturer of NAND chips in the world after Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) and Toshiba. Its streak of negative revenue growth finally ended, and analysts now expect its revenue and earnings to respectively rise 6% and 36% this year.2017 YTD NAND MARKET SHARES. DATA SOURCE: CHINAFLASHMARKET. CHART BY AUTHOR.If its consortium had won the Toshiba bid, Western Digital could potentially have become the second largest NAND maker in the world. That scale would have allowed it to compete more effectively against Samsung in terms of capacity and pricing. It would also have been a sound long-term investment, since the global NAND market could grow from $40 billion this year to $65 billion by 2020, according to research firm ChinaFlashMarket.But with SK Hynix now gaining a slice of Toshiba's memory business, the South Korean tech giant could scale up and become a bigger threat to slightly larger players like WD and Micron (NASDAQ:MU). This means that WD's NAND margins could get squeezed in the near future.But Western Digital isn't giving up yet...Toshiba's decision to go with SK Hynix and Bain represents a significant blow to Western Digital, but the company isn't giving up yet. The company recently filed for arbitration against Toshiba through the ICC International Court of Arbitration, claiming that Toshiba shouldn't be allowed to invest in a new flash memory production line in Japan unless SanDisk was also allowed to participate.Western Digital can also cite a ruling in a California court in July, which states that Toshiba must give SanDisk a two-week notice before closing any transfer of their joint venture interests to mull its legal options. In other words, Western Digital isn't going down without a fight.But for now, investors shouldn't let those legal battles overshadow the fact that WD is still pretty cheap at seven times next year's earnings, and it pays a decent dividend yield of 2.2% to patient investors.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Western Digital Corp. Beat the Street, but Shares Fell Anyway","Jul 29, 2017 at 10:39AM","Shares of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) took a cold bath on Friday. Following the release of the hard drive maker's fourth-quarter results, the stock fell as much as 8.5% in Friday's trading session.What went wrong? Let's have a look.By the numbersMetricQ4 2017Q4 2016Year-Over-Year GrowthRevenue$3.99 billion$3.50 billion14%Free cash flow$761 million$114 million568%Adjusted net income$881 million$269 million228%Earnings per share (diluted)$2.93$1.02187%DATA SOURCE: WESTERN DIGITAL. ADJUSTED RESULTS INCLUDE PRO FORMA REVENUE FROM SANDISK IN THE YEAR-AGO QUARTER, THOUGH THE ACQUISITION CLOSED NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THAT PERIOD.Western Digital shipped 39.3 million hard drive units in the fourth quarter, a 2% year-over-year decrease. Average unit prices held steady at $63 per drive, and the average storage capacity per shipped drive rose 65% to land at 2.1 terabytes.Breaking the company's sales down by device types, unit sales held relatively steady in the consumer electronics and enterprise markets. Notebook drive shipments fell by 10% but desktop sales increased by 13%.An aggressive cost-cutting program reduced Western Digital's employee headcount by 7.2% compared to the year-ago tally, including a 5% cut and 3,600 positions eliminated in the fourth quarter alone.Looking ahead, management posted the following guidance targets:Revenue should stop near $5.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, an 8% year-over-year jump.Non-GAAP earnings are estimated at roughly $3.30 per diluted share for the same period, up from $1.18 per share in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.Full-year adjusted earnings were projected to exceed $12.00 per share. That would be at least a 30% increase over the 2017 total.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Wait a minute...those are good numbers. What's up with the price drop?Yep, Western Digital met or exceeded Wall Street's targets on all counts, including the forward-looking guidance figures. If you want to nitpick, the next-year earnings target was set approximately 2% below the current Street view, but keep in mind that this was the presented as the bottom end of Western Digital's projections.The only reasonable explanation for Friday's drop is profit-taking. Heading into the report, Western Digital shares had gained 75% in 52 weeks and 35% in 2017 alone. I can see how short-term traders might be tempted to take a few of their chips off the table after a run like that, no matter how good the reported and projected results might be.I'm perfectly happy holding on to the Western Digital shares in my retirement portfolio. The hard drive market is healthier than it has any right to be, and this company is much better prepared for a sea change to solid-state storage than archrival Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) ever was. The SanDisk buyout is already making a difference there, and that operation will only grow more important over the next few years.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Shares of Western Digital Corporation Slid Nearly 12% Last Month,"Dec 12, 2017 at 5:16PM","What happenedShares of Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) tumbled 11.7%in November, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, after Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty downgraded the company's stock on the expectation that NAND flash memory prices will fall. So whatHuberty wrote in an investor note that she believes NAND memory prices will fall by 7% to 15% each quarter, starting in the calendar first-quarter 2018, which is clearly unwelcome news for Western Digital's NAND business. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.It's worth remembering, though, that flash memory, like many other chips and semiconductors, is a cyclical business, and NAND prices have been going up for a while. Sooner or later those prices had to start sliding back down, and when that happens the share prices of companies making those products typically suffers.Additionally, the calendar first quarter is typically slow for chip companies, so the news came at a particularly bad time. Now whatWestern Digital's COO, Michael Cordano, referenced the possibility of sliding NAND prices on the company's fiscal first-quarter 2018 earnings call back in October. At the time he said they were already causing the company's average selling prices (ASPs) to be flat, noting ""I think we talked about last quarter that ASPs had flattened. That was our expectation coming into this quarter, and that's really our expectation as we sit today. So we don't see continued movement in a substantial way up, but it's being sustained at this -- at the current level.""In short, NAND prices were already causing the company's ASPs to be flat. The problem is that if the prices do indeed start falling as much as Huberty expects, then that flatness could translate into a real slide. Investors will have to keep a close eye on the next few quarters to see if that does indeed play out, and know that it's likely just a small part of larger cyclical chip price dip.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Why Square, Western Digital, and Weatherford International Slumped Today","Nov 27, 2017 at 4:30PM","Monday was the first regular day that investors in the stock market have seen in a while, with post-holiday trading reflecting a solid Thanksgiving weekend from the retail sector balanced by weakness in other areas. Major benchmarks were mixed and little changed from where they ended Friday's holiday-shortened session, but investors kept their attention squarely on Washington, where the Senate will take up tax reform in the homestretch of the year. Despite generally upbeat viewpoints on the market as a whole, shares of some companies posted significant losses. Square (NYSE:SQ), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Weatherford International (NYSE:WFT) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.Square gives back its gainsShares of Square dropped 16%, more than wiping out its double-digit percentage gain from last week. The electronic payment pioneer's rise had stemmed from optimism surrounding Square's embracing of bitcoin-based transactions within its platform. Yet after two straight weeks of gains, analysts at BTIG downgraded the stock from neutral to sell, citing concerns about the ability for Square to reach consistent profitability in the near future. Other analysts have seen Square's prospects more favorably, but the strategic bitcoin move does have a chance of backfiring if the cryptocurrency's recent explosive move higher reverses itself.IMAGE SOURCE: SQUARE.Western Digital faces a possible market reversalWestern Digital stock fell 7% after the company got a negative outlook from analysts. Morgan Stanley analysts downgraded the memory and storage specialist's shares along with those of several of Western Digital's peers, arguing that the recent boom in prices of NAND flash memory chips is likely at or near its high for the product cycle. With anticipated price declines coming, Western Digital could suffer a hit to its profits. Those who've been through past down cycles in memory know the damage it can do to stock prices, so it's not surprising to see Western Digital shareholders panic a bit at the prospect of a market top.Weatherford looks less energeticFinally, shares of Weatherford International finished down 7%. The oil and gas exploration and production company's move was largely fueled by a substantial decline in the price of crude, which dropped about $1 per barrel to fall below $58. In addition, Weatherford said that it would sell assets worth as much as $8 billion in order to manage its debt load, a prudent financial move that nevertheless highlighted the vulnerability of its balance sheet. Weatherford's growth hasn't been as strong as its peers' lately, and that's likely to weigh on its relative performance until the company can get things turned around.10 stocks we like better than Weatherford InternationalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Instant Analysis: Toshiba Suing Western Digital for $1.1 Billion,"Jun 30, 2017 at 8:11AM","What happened?Japan's Toshiba (NASDAQOTH:TOSBF) has filed a fresh lawsuit against U.S. storage giant Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). The suit, filed in Tokyo District Court, centers on Toshiba Memory Corporation, a 50-50 joint venture operated by the two companies. Toshiba has been attempting to sell the unit on its own in order to help shore up a damaged balance sheet. It selected a buyer, a consortium of Japan's Innovation Network Corporation, Bain Capital Private Equity, and Development Bank of Japan.Western Digital subsequently filed suit in California to block that deal. It maintains that, according to the terms of its collaboration with the Japanese company, any sale requires its approval. In its action, Toshiba alleges that Western Digital ""has continually interfered with the bid process with TMC."" It is suing for damages of 120 billion yen ($1.1 billion), and has petitioned for an injunction to lift Western Digital's existing legal challenge.Western Digital also alleges that, as per the terms of their collaboration, any disputes between the two companies must be decided by professional arbitration.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Does it matter?This is the latest punch in a fight that's rapidly getting ugly. The dispute arguably dates back to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of Toshiba nuclear power subsidiary Westinghouse Electric in March. Because of this, Toshiba has negative shareholder equity of almost 582 billion yen ($5.2 billion). Hence its eagerness to sell a valuable asset, which could fetch somewhere in the neighborhood of $20 billion.Western Digital seems just as intent on keeping its hands on the business. In fact, just before Toshiba's lawsuit was announced, it submitted a bid of its own, in conjunction with buyout boutique KKR.No matter which company ultimately prevails, though, this nasty dispute doesn't help either one.Toshiba has been a poor investment -- and in my opinion not worth considering just now. As for Western Digital, the company's doing well, and this situation isn't enough of a drag to sell the stock. Still, investors should cross their fingers and hope for some kind of resolution soon.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Why Altria Group, Western Digital, and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Slumped Today","Jul 28, 2017 at 4:30PM","Friday was a mixed day on Wall Street, with major benchmarks posting small moves in either direction to finish out the week. Some market participants pointed to the defeat of the proposed repeal of the Affordable Care Act in the Senate as weighing on sentiment even in the face of economic data showing solid gains in the second quarter of 2017, but earnings season also created substantial volatility among individual stocks. Several well-known companies reported bad news either in their quarterly reports or in other areas of their respective businesses, and Altria Group (NYSE:MO), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Goodyear Tire & Rubber (NASDAQ:GT) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.Altria gets smokedShares of Altria Group fell 9.5% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced a new initiative to regulate cigarettes more heavily. The FDA said that it would like to see tobacco companies take steps to reduce the amount of nicotine that is present in traditional cigarettes, with the goal of taking the level down below the threshold for smokers to become addicted. The regulatory agency said that curbing addiction should lead to millions of lives saved over time. As it has done with past FDA efforts, Altria responded the proposal with carefully crafted comments, characterizing the FDA announcement as ""an important evolution in the [FDA's] approach to regulating tobacco products and a meaningful step forward in developing a comprehensive regulatory policy that acknowledges the continuum of risk."" Shareholders weren't nearly as calm, and stocks across the industry shuddered at the regulatory move.IMAGE SOURCE: ALTRIA GROUP.Western Digital falls despite solid resultsWestern Digital stock declined nearly 8% even though the data storage specialist reported fairly strong results in its fiscal fourth-quarter financial report. The company said that revenue jumped 39% compared to the year-earlier period, and Western Digital reversed a year-ago loss with a $280 million profit, topping the consensus forecast among those following the stock. Yet some shareholders were unimpressed by the storage company's revenue forecast for the current quarter, and others are nervous about an outstanding legal case with Toshiba concerning the two companies' memory-chip joint venture. Until some of those uncertainties get resolved, investors seemed unwilling to give Western Digital the benefit of the doubt.Goodyear gets a flatFinally, shares of Goodyear Tire & Rubber dropped close to 8.5%. The tire maker reported slightly weaker second-quarter financial results than investors had expected, including a 10% drop in tire unit sales volume and a 44% decline in adjusted net income compared to the year-ago quarter. Goodyear pointed to heightened competition in the U.S. and European markets as partial causes for tough conditions, along with volatility in costs of raw materials used to make its products. Even though the company saw favorable trends in automobile-related metrics, weakening consumer replacement demand has posed short-term challenges for Goodyear, even though it remains confident about its longer-term prospects. With new guidance reductions for the full 2017 year, Goodyear investors can only hope that things improve for the tire giant sooner rather than later."
How Risky Is Micron Technology Inc.?,"Jun 28, 2017 at 6:37PM","Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), one of the world's top memory chipmakers, saw its shares surge 140% over the past 12 months. That big rally was sparked by two straight quarters of double-digit annual sales growth, which was fueled by a global shortage of memory chips causing a big jump in market prices.But how much upside potential does Micron really have left? To figure that out, we'll evaluate four different risks facing the company.IMAGE SOURCE: MICRON.1. The competitive risksMicron isn't the biggest player in the memory chip market. It's actually the fourth-largest NAND manufacturer in the world and third-largest maker of DRAM chips. In the NAND market, it trails behind Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), Toshiba, and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) -- in that order. In the DRAM market, it lags behind Samsung and SK Hynix.Being a smaller player in the chipmaking market can be tough, since larger competitors can produce chips at lower prices. That market is also undergoing consolidation. That's why Western Digital acquired SanDisk last year, and why a bidding war for Toshiba's chipmaking business recently broke out.To keep pace with its bigger rivals, Micron is developing next-gen memory technologies like 3D NAND and 3D Xpoint with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and buying manufacturers like Inotera Memories. However, it's still unclear if these moves can adequately counter companies like Samsung, which can bundle their memory chips with other components, over the long term.2. The cyclical risksThe memory chip market is a cyclical one, which can punish investors who buy at the peaks. Looking back, Micron posted six straight quarters of annual revenue declines before rising demand finally broke that streak with two straight quarters of growth.Analysts expect that trend to continue, with 58% revenue growth this year and 9% growth next year. Its non-GAAP earnings per share, which came in at $0.06 in 2016, is expected to surge to $4.31 this year and $5.25 next year.However, that growth could still be derailed by overproduction. Last December, former Micron CEO Mark Durcan warned that state-backed Chinese chipmakers -- like Tsinghua Unigroup, which tried to buy Micron in 2015 -- could flood the market with cheap memory chips. Meanwhile, bigger rivals like Samsung could produce too many chips in their effort to meet market demand -- which would cause prices to drop.3.The cash flow risksA sudden reversal in memory chip prices would devastate Micron, because its free cash flow has remained negative over the past year. That's mainly due to the prior drop in memory prices, higher R&D investments, and its acquisitions of SSD controller maker Tidal Systems in 2015 and Inotera Memories in 2016.DATA SOURCE: YCHARTS.If chip prices unexpectedly drop on market consolidation, lower device sales, or overproduction, Micron's FCF could plummet to multiyear lows.4. The valuation risksMicron initially looks pricey at 55 times earnings, but that multiple remains lower than the industry average P/E of 59 for memory chipmakers. If analysts' forecasts are on the mark, then Micron trades at just 7.5 times forward earnings.Intel and Western Digital, respectively, have forward P/E ratios of 12 and 9. This means that Micron is still surprisingly cheap after its yearlong rally.So how risky is Micron?If you believe that memory prices will continue to rise, Micron can counter its bigger rivals, and that analysts' growth estimates are on target, then the stock looks like a great buy at current prices. Simply put, the short-term risks look quite low.But if memory prices suddenly drop, Micron could give up its gains very quickly. Furthermore, investors need to know that Micron isn't a great buy-and-hold stock, since its cyclical downturns can be very challenging. Therefore, Micron's long-term risks remain quite high.10 stocks we like better than Micron TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Don't Get Greedy With Micron Technology, Inc. Stock","Nov 22, 2017 at 3:31PM","Shares of memory chipmaker Micron (NASDAQ:MU) rallied nearly 120% this year as surging demand for memory chips lifted market prices to multi-year highs. But even after that rally, Micron looks surprisingly cheap at six times next year's earnings, and analysts expect its revenue and earnings to respectively rise 23% and 56% this year.Those numbers make Micron look like a screaming buy, but investors shouldn't get greedy with this stock just yet. Here are four key issues to consider before buying Micron's stock at these historic highs.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.1. Memory prices are near a cyclical peakMicron controls 22% of the global DRAM market, according to TrendForce. That makes it the third largest player after Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) and SK Hynix, which respectively control 46% and 32% of the market. Micron also controls 13% of the NAND market, putting it in fourth place behind Samsung, Toshiba, and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC).Tighter supplies and surging demand boosted prices for both DRAM and NAND chips over the past year. However, those prices are peaking, and research firm Gartner expects prices to plummet in 2019. That would be great news for OEMs and consumers since cheaper components equal cheaper devices and higher margins, but it would torpedo Micron's core business. That's why analysts expect Micron's revenue and earnings to respectively dip 0.2% and 11.5% next year.2. Market consolidation strengthens the competitionThe memory chip market is currently undergoing some major consolidation. Western Digital, which previously purchased several smaller NAND makers, closed its acquisition of SanDisk last year.Toshiba, meanwhile, which was struggling to cover losses at its US nuclear power unit, agreed to sell its memory chipmaking unit to a consortium of companies led by Bain Capital and SK Hynix in October. Those big mergers could make it tougher for Micron to keep pace in terms of scale and production costs. On the bright side, Micron still has the backing of its longtime partner Intel, which could help it keep pace with its bigger rivals with newer 3D NAND and 3D Xpoint technologies.3. One (or more) companies will ramp up productionMemory chip prices are currently at multi-year highs because the big players aren't ramping up production yet. Once one of these companies does, the dominoes will fall as supply is rebalanced with demand.Micron has stated that it won't boost its DRAM capacity for the foreseeable future, and plans to concentrate on shrinking its die size to remain ahead of the tech curve. However, Samsung's recent opening of the world's biggest chipmaking plant indicates that it plans to ramp up its production. SK Hynix also recently stated that it will start boosting its DRAM capacity. As these supplies rise and drive down prices, ""pure plays"" like Micron will be hurt much more than diversified tech giants like Samsung.4. The concerns about ChinaLast year, Micron's then-CEO Mark Durcan warned that China could flood the market with cheaper memory chips as it invests more heavily in its domestic semiconductor industry. China's state-backed Tsinghua Unigroup notably tried to buy Micron two years ago, but the deal was abandoned due to US regulatory concerns.But that hasn't stopped China from trying to gain access to Micron's tech. Earlier this year, there were two separate cases of Micron's trade secrets being leaked from Taiwan to Chinese chipmakers by disgruntled employees. These cases indicate that China is dead serious about releasing its homegrown memory chips, and that Durcan's dire predictions could come true.Why you shouldn't get greedyThe right time to buy Micron was in mid-2016, just as the previous boom-and-bust cycle in memory prices reached its trough. But with memory chip prices now approaching a cyclical peak, it's reckless to expect Micron to replicate its gains from the past year. Therefore, Micron might be a good short-term play for the next few months, but I wouldn't consider it a safe long-term investment. "
3 Top Tech Dividend Stocks to Buy Now,"Dec 29, 2017 at 10:41AM","The tech sector didn't used to be a great place to look if you were on the hunt for high yield. That's changed as some companies have matured and shifted into periods of slower growth, and investors now have a range of tech dividend stocks to choose from.In addition to offering investors dependable returned income, some of these companies also have underappreciated business prospects and beaten-down valuations -- setting up dynamics that could pave the way for substantial capital appreciation on top of regular income generation. Here's why IBM (NYSE:IBM), AT&T (NYSE:T), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) are top income-generating stocks in the tech sector. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.IBMWith a 3.9% yield and a 22-year history of annual payout increases, IBM has one of the best returned-income profiles in the tech sector. The stock also looks pretty cheap trading at roughly 11 times forward earnings estimates and 13 times trailing free cash flow. Those are attractive characteristics, to be sure, but they don't exist in a vacuum.With a 22-quarter streak of consecutive year-over-year sales declines and trailing revenues at a 15-year low, there are valid reasons why the market has been cool on Big Blue. Shares have lost roughly 8% of their value in 2017 while the S&P 500 index has gained nearly 20%. Even so, the stock looks like a good play for investors who are willing to take on the risk profile that comes with its shift to new businesses.There are some compelling indicators that its turnaround effort has the company poised for a rebound. Last quarter saw its combined cloud, security, data analytics, and mobile businesses grow revenues 11% and comprise 45% of total sales. Meanwhile, its legacy hardware and software services businesses declined roughly 8%. The company's cloud services have tallied up $15.8 billion in sales over the trailing-12-month period, and a favorable growth outlook for the overall cloud infrastructure and platform markets gives IBM a promising avenue to return to sales growth over the long term. It's also staked investments in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and quantum computing -- opportunities that are difficult to model at present but ones that could have tremendous payoffs. IBM's business outlook isn't as concrete as other top dividend stocks you might find in other sectors, but it offers investors a rare combination of value, growth potential, and a great yield.AT&T2017 was supposed to be the year that AT&T put most of the finishing touches on its merger with Time Warner. It didn't play out that way, and shares have shed roughly 9% of their value this year amid that disappointment and declining subscriptions for the company's postpaid wireless service and core DirecTV satellite television packages. While the telecom giant's stock has significantly underperformed the broader market this year, soggy performance presents long-term investors with an opportunity to buy a good company at an inexpensive price.Shares trade at just 13 times forward earnings estimates and come with a dividend that helps make a strong case for ownership. AT&T packs a roughly 5% yield and recently announced its 34th consecutive annual payout increase -- raising its payout roughly 2%. Admittedly, payout growth has been slow in recent years, but it already offers a great yield and shareholders can count on regular increases going forward. The company's business prospects appear to be underappreciated as well.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.AT&T is on track to be a leader in 5G network technology. While previous generations of wireless networks have delivered faster connections for mobile devices, 5G will also serve as the key fabric for connecting a new range of devices including cars, wearables, and smart-city technologies. Expanding its 5G network technology will be capital intensive, but it should also widen the company's competitive edge in the wireless space and help it branch into new, high-growth platform and service categories. If the company's acquisition of Time Warner gets the go-ahead following a pending legal challenge from the Department of Justice, AT&T will also become a global leader in entertainment content and have new service bundling and advertising opportunities that could spur sustained earnings momentum. I think there's a good chance that the merger will eventually go through -- paving the way for a new growth phase for AT&T -- but the stock has the potential to be a worthwhile long-term investment even if the deal were to be blocked.Seagate TechnologyWhile Seagate Technology is still the world's leading producer of hard drives, shifts in the industry have hamstrung performance in recent years and depressed the company's share price. Cloud storage is presenting alternative ways to house data for computers and mobile devices, and the company's chief rival Western Digital has been the biggest beneficiary of rising demand for solid state drives. Under these pressures, Seagate's stock has shed nearly 40% of its value over the last three yearsThe consumer market might not drive growth in the same ways going forward, but Seagate is looking at increased infrastructure spending from cloud service providers and large enterprises that seems likely to power performance over the long term. The world is still in the midst of a digital data explosion, with new devices and the proliferation of high-definition video streams ensuring that there's more information to be stored and transmitted with each passing minute. Putting this growth trend in context, research firm IDC estimates that the amount of data generated annually will have increased tenfold from 2016 to 2025 as connected devices, automation, and machine-to-machine communications become increasingly central in every day life. That's going to create a lot of new demand at the data-center level, and Seagate is in position to benefit.The company's shares have rallied since its first-quarter report delivered better-than-expected results in October, but the stock still looks to present a bargain for long-term investors. Seagate trades at roughly 11 times trailing free cash flow and 11 times forward earnings estimates while offering a 6.1% yield. If it even comes close to hitting the average analyst estimate for annual earnings growth of nearly 19% over the next five years, the stock will prove to be an absolute steal at today's prices."
3 Stocks That Are Absurdly Cheap Right Now,"Dec 15, 2017 at 6:22AM","With the stock market at record levels, finding cheap stocks has taken on new layers of difficulty. It has also become increasingly important.To help our readers identify investments that offer protection against a potential downturn, as well as avenues to substantial capital appreciation, we put together a panel of Motley Fool investors and asked each member propose a stock they think presents long-term opportunity at a relative bargain price today, and to shed some light on why. Their picks: IBM (NYSE:IBM), General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX).IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.A cheap dividend play for intrepid investorsChris Neiger (IBM): I have to get this out of the way first: IBM is not for everyone. The company's top line has fallen for 22 consecutive quarters and in the third quarter of 2017, its earnings fell 4% year over year. It's no wonder then, that IBM shares are trading at just 13 times the company's trailing 12-month earnings, and 11 times estimated forward earnings -- both ratios far below the tech industry's average. IBM is in the middle of a major transition right now as it pivots toward a focus on new growth areas like cloud computing and artificial intelligence. For example, the cloud now accounts for 20% of the company's top line; over the past 12 months, IBM has brought in $15.8 billion from its cloud sales. The company says that just over half of that cloud revenue come from ""as-a-service"" sales, which means those deals will be bringing in recurring revenue, in contrast to one-off hardware or software sales.The tech giant is also looking to its Watson artificial intelligence (AI) and other cognitive computing services for growth. IBM's cognitive computing sales hit $4.4 billion in Q3 -- 23% of total sales. The company believes it can keep growing this segment; it expects the entire cognitive computing market to be worth $2 trillion by 2025. IBM is clearly making some strides on the cloud and cognitive computing fronts, but this beaten-up company still has a long way to go before it convinces most investors that its stock is a safe bet. One thing that may tempt some investors to jump in on this turnaround play is IBM's 3.9% dividend. I'm content to wait on the sidelines for now, but the company is certainly one that investors should keep an eye on.Overlooked opportunityDaniel Miller (General Motors): Even after General Motors'  stock's 21% rise over the past six months, it still trades at a paltry 6.9 forward price-to-earnings ratio, per Morningstar.com earnings estimates -- and that's absurdly cheap territory.Too many investors are focused on the short term: That forward P/E  reflects peaking auto sales in the U.S. market, GM's profit engine. But investors should look at the opportunity ahead in an industry destined to  evolve into something completely new over the next two to three decades. GM's driving toward a vision of zero crashes, zero congestion and zero emissions. It's opportunities include new revenue streams from the connected car (where its OnStar service gives it an entry point); shared mobility projects that include its Maven brand; and the development of driverless vehicle technology and electric vehicles.While those opportunities will take time to develop and bear fruit, GM has also proven it can improve its business here and now, and reward its shareholders. In fact, from 2012 through 2017, the automaker has returned $25 billion through dividends and repurchases. That's reduced shares outstanding by 25%, and generated a payout that currently yields 3.6%.The auto industry is on track to change more in the next two decades than it did over the previous ten, and GM is more prepared for that type of evolution than ever before. That should be music to the ears of investors willing to ride the cyclical auto industry and focus on the long term.Store this one away for the long termKeith Noonan (Seagate Technology): Even after rallying 20% since its releasing its first-quarter results on Oct. 23, Seagate Technology's stock still looks like a bargain. It trades at roughly 11 times trailing free cash flow, 10.5 times forward earnings estimates, and just just 1.2 times forward sales. While there are good reasons that the hard disk drive maker trades at low multiples relative to the broader market, there's enough upside to justify owning the company for the long haul. Let's talk first about why the stock can be had for cheap. Seagate's sales have dipped roughly 25% over the last three years as solid-state drives (a product category led by competitor Western Digital) have gained traction and increasing adoption for cloud storage, casting uncertainty over the fate of the hard disk drive business. While the rise of cloud storage means less consumer demand for hard disk drives, the data boom stemming from the rapid increase in the number of connected devices and the size of files transmitted means that data centers will have increased storage needs. In fact, research firm IDC estimates that annual global data generation will grow tenfold from 2016 to 2025 -- a trend that looks very favorable for Seagate shareholders.The stock also offers investors a generous dividend that bolsters the case for long-term ownership. Shares currently yield roughly 6%, and the company's six-year streak of annual payout increases suggests that Seagate will continue to bolster its returned-income profile. With the current dividend consuming just 65% of trailing free cash flow, the company appears to be in good shape to continue boosting its payout.Seagate's big dividend, low earnings multiples, and underappreciated business prospects point to value that's much greater than the market is giving the company credit for. 10 stocks we like better than IBMWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why Seagate Technology plc Stock Fell 11.1% in June,"Jul 7, 2017 at 1:24PM","What happenedShares of Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) fell 11.1% in June, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.So whatThe bulk of Seagate's June pain came when rival hard drive maker Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) issued preliminary fourth-quarter results with wider gross margins and higher bottom-line profits than previously expected. Western Digital explained its surprising profitability with strong demand for helium-filled 10-terabyte drives and flash-based storage devices -- two areas where Seagate is not a serious competitor. Seagate shares immediately plunged 7% on the news while Western Digital traded fairly flat that day.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Now whatBoth Seagate and Western Digital have been crushing the market in recent quarters. Seagate shares have soared 62% higher over the last 52 weeks, while Western Digital delivered an 84% return over the same period. End-market demand for digital storage is more than healthy, even in the old-school hard drive sector that caters to low-cost storage devices with large capacities.Meanwhile, Western Digital shares can be bought for just 7.2 times forward earnings estimates today, and Seagate's forward P/E ratio stands at a very affordable 8.3. These soaring storage stocks appear to have more room to run."
Should You Buy Seagate After its First Quarter Surprise?,"Oct 27, 2017 at 5:08PM","Seagate Technology's (NASDAQ:STX) stock rallied by about 13% after the hard drive maker posted better-than-expected first quarter earnings on Oct. 23. But even after that pop, Seagate's stock remains down about 25% over the past six months.Seagate's headline numbers were unremarkable, but they still beat analyst expectations. Its revenue fell 6% annually to $2.63 billion, topping estimates by $110 million. Non-GAAP earnings slipped 3% to $0.96 per share, but also beat expectations by $0.11.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.But if we dig deeper into Seagate's quarter, we'll understand why buyers came back to this unloved stock. Let's examine the bullish catalysts to see if the stock is a worthy buy at current prices.Understanding Seagate's predicamentSeagate is the second largest maker of platter-based HDDs (hard disk drives) in the world after Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). This market is a tough one for two reasons -- it's heavily commoditized, and HDDs are gradually being displaced by SSDs (solid state drives).SSDs store data on NAND flash memory chips instead of platters, so they're smaller, faster, less prone to damage, and consume less power. This makes them ideal for high-end laptops, PCs, and data centers. SSDs are pricier on a per gigabyte basis, but many industry analysts believe that they'll achieve price parity with HDDs within the next few years.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.To escape that inevitable downturn, Western Digital acquired flash memory and SSD maker SanDisk for nearly $19 billion last year. That was a smart move, since surging NAND prices lifted SanDisk's revenue and offset WD's softer sales of traditional HDDs.Seagate acquired some NAND chips through its acquisition of Samsung's  HDD unit and partnerships with Micron and SK Hynix. It was also part of the consortium, led by Bain Capital and SK Hynix, which recently agreed to buy Toshiba's memory chipmaking business for $18 billion.However, none of those deals helped it keep pace with market leaders Samsung and Western Digital, which together control over half of the entire SSD market. Seagate's partners, Micron, SK Hynix, and Toshiba, each control single-digit shares of that market.Focusing on the growing need for high-capacity HDDsWithout a meaningful foothold in the SSD market, Seagate focused on boosting the capacity of its existing HDDs for enterprise customers. The main idea is that while enterprise HDDs will never beat SSDs in terms of performance, demand for high-capacity HDDs should keep rising as a surge in data from streaming media, apps, and other cloud services causes data center operators to prioritize capacity over raw speed.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.That's precisely what we saw during the first quarter, as Seagate's HDD shipments rose 5% annually and its average capacity per hard drive rose 12% to 1.9 terabytes per drive. However, its average selling price still fell three dollars to $64, and its non-GAAP gross margin dipped from 29.5% to 29% -- but those declines came in lighter than expected.Analysts expect Seagate's revenue and earnings to respectively slip 4% and 3% this year, so its turnaround won't take shape anytime soon. But its numbers are stabilizing, and the company isn't sitting idly by as HDDs become obsolete. Instead, it's expanding its portfolio with its aforementioned NAND partnerships, which could eventually help it gain a bigger slice of the SSD market.Seagate could also fare better than Western Digital if NAND prices, which are approaching a cyclical high, crash. That's because Seagate purchases NAND chips from partners instead of directly selling them like SanDisk, so lower NAND prices would boost its margins instead of crushing them.What about the valuations and dividends?Seagate looks fairly cheap at 11 times next year's earnings. But Western Digital has a lower forward P/E of 7 thanks to the accretive boost from its SanDisk acquisition.As for the dividend, Seagate's forward yield of 6.4% is much higher than WD's 2.3% yield. Seagate spent just 73% of its earnings and 38% of its free cash flow on that payout over the past 12 months, so its high yield shouldn't be considered a red flag.So is it time to buy Seagate?Seagate's first quarter numbers reveal that its core business is stabilizing, and that the bearish thesis of SSDs completely wiping out HDDs might be overblown. Looking ahead, Seagate could tread water with higher capacity HDDs as it gradually expands into SSDs or hybrid storage solutions.Until that happens, its low valuation and high dividend should also set a floor under the stock. I'm not completely confident that Seagate is returning to growth yet, but these factors indicate that it probably wouldn't hurt to nibble on the stock at current prices.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 ETFs to Keep Your Retirement Savings on Track,"Aug 3, 2017 at 11:00AM","At the Motley Fool, we believe investing in stocks is the most effective way to predictably generate wealth over the long term, which lets the power of compounding returns do its work. But not everyone has the time or inclination to research individual stocks. So thankfully, one promising alternative is to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF), a marketable security that tracks a particular index and trades on a major stock exchange. To that end, we asked three top Motley Fool investors to offer an ETF investors could use to help keep their retirement savings on track, and they chose the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:VOO), the Vanguard REIT ETF (NYSEMKT:VNQ), and the Vanguard Mid-Cap Value ETF (NYSEMKT:VOE)PUT YOUR CASH TO WORK IN A HIGH-QUALITY ETF. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGESIf you can't beat 'em...Steve Symington (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF): It's already exceedingly difficult to beat the S&P 500 Index, which is arguably the most widely followed barometer for the broader-market's performance, and has averaged historical annual returns of roughly 10%. In fact, according to a research report from Standard & Poor's on actively managed funds earlier this year, 92.15% of all large-cap, 95.4% of mid-cap, and 93.21% of small-cap managers have lagged their respective benchmarks over the 15-year period ended December 2016.So why not buy a low-cost ETF like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF? Just like it sounds, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF invests in stocks in the S&P 500, with the goal of closely tracking the index's returns -- an attractive proposition when so many others trail behind. What's more, in keeping with most Vanguard products, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF boasts an ultra-low expense ratio of 0.04% compared to the higher industry-average ETF expense ratio of 0.28%. Not paying those extra fees will add up as your gains compound over the years, and should result in a hefty extra chunk of cash in your retirement savings.For investors who would rather not buy individual stocks, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is a great option to keep your retirement savings on track.A great complement to stocks and bondsMatt DiLallo (Vanguard REIT ETF): Investing in real estate is a great way to invest for and during retirement. Not only does the sector help diversify some of the risks of investing in stocks and bonds, but investors can collect a steadily rising income stream, with additional upside potential as real estate values appreciate. While there are plenty of ways to invest in real estate, one of the easiest is to buy an exchanged-traded fund focused on the sector, with the top option, in my opinion, being the Vanguard REIT ETF.One of the things I like about the Vanguard REIT ETF is that it offers broad exposure across several types of commercial properties because it invests in more than 150 REITs that own healthcare, office, residential, industrial, and hotel and resort properties. This diversified exposure enables investors to benefit from the upside of investing in real estate while minimizing the downside that comes from choosing the wrong REIT. Further, investors can reduce their risk while still collecting a healthy income stream, given that the Vanguard REIT ETF currently yields nearly 4.4%.That said, what makes the Vanguard REIT ETF stand apart from the crowd is its lower expenses. In fact, its current expense ratio of 0.12% is 90% lower than competing funds with similar holdings. Those fees can really add up. For example, a hypothetical $10,000 investment that earns a 9% annual return over 10 years would generate $2,777 in fees if invested in a competing fund. However, that same investment would only produce $283 in fees at Vanguard, which means more money stays in your portfolio, helping you stay on track with your retirement savings plan. That's why I think the Vanguard REIT ETF is the right option for retirement-focused investors.Mid-sized value for a microscopic feeCory Renauer (Vanguard Mid-Cap Value ETF): Investors looking for an inexpensive way to keep their retirement savings on track will want to take a closer look at this option from the low-cost fund leader. This ETF exposes investors to a well-diversified portfolio of mid-sized U.S. stocks that look relatively undervalued when measured on a handful of metrics, and does it all with a shockingly low 0.07% expense ratio.For such a low fee, you might expect a simple strategy, but Vanguard's Mid-Cap Value ETF is a bit more sophisticated than you might expect. The ETF tracks the U.S. Mid-Cap Value Index created by the Center for Research in Security Prices, which takes a very interesting approach to providing investors with exposure to mid-cap stocks that look undervalued.In a nutshell, the fund selects stocks smaller than those representing 70% of the U.S. stock market by market capitalization, but still larger than those representing the smallest 15% of the market. With a basket of suitably sized stocks in place, it applies value scores derived from price-to-earnings ratios and other common metrics. Stocks that pass through the size filter with the highest value scores make the cut, but their weight in the portfolio is based on market-cap size, not their value scores.At the end of June, the diverse portfolio was made up of 202 stocks, with Newell Brands and Western Digital taking up the most space with a weighting of 1.4% each. The majority of stocks in the fund sported market caps of $13 billion or less and were trading at about 18.8 times trailing earnings. With the average stock in the S&P 500 trading at 23.94 times trailing earnings, this mid-cap value ETF certainly lives up to its name."
Should You Buy Semiconductor Stocks in 2018?,"Dec 30, 2017 at 7:01PM","Investors in semiconductor stocks have been handed one big reason to be thankful for this year: double-digit returns. As measured by the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (NYSEMKT:XSD), the sector has risen over 25% in 2017.DATA BY YCHARTS.However, in recent weeks the sector has taken a step back while the broader market has continued to churn its way higher. If not for a 10% correction, semiconductor stocks would have notched even better returns on the year. Rather than worry, though, 2018 looks like it could be another good year to invest in the industry.Why a pullback now?After a big run-up in share prices, the recent drop could be attributed to end-of-year profit taking by traders and investment managers. Such activity is common, especially after a strong showing for stocks like 2017 will end up being.But some of the pullback could also be blamed on several analyst notes that are calling for a more muted 2018. Morgan Stanley in particular called out high-flying memory chip makers, saying that over-supply could cause prices to drop in the new year. Several names that focus on memory devices, like Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), were downgraded. The semiconductor sector as a whole started to trend down after the comments.Tailwinds for growthAnalyst coverage may have some spooked, but not all chips are the same. The industry as a whole is diversified, with various manufacturers tending to specialize in particular areas. Memory chips are but one piece of the whole pie, as other businesses focus on microprocessors, connectivity, sensors, equipment, etc.That means that if memory chip growth does slow, it doesn't mean the whole industry will. In fact, the Internet of Things move toward internet connection for machines is expected to keep growing, underpinning prospects for specialized makers of connectivity chips and sensors. The expectation is that will be a tailwind in 2018 for companies like Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) and Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY), both of which are benefiting from the movement to connect more things to the internet.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Another reason for optimism is continued merger and acquisition activity. Various semiconductor companies have been busy consolidating to streamline operations and to realize cost savings. That activity could continue to benefit shareholders in the year ahead if profits continue to rise as a result.Valuations on semiconductor stocks also look fairly reasonable, even after this year's blockbuster performance. The average one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio sits at about 15, compared with 19 for the S&P 500. Reasonable prices for future growth potential could help shares rise in the year ahead. A word of cautionAll of that being said, it is important to remember that semiconductors are a cyclical business. As the building blocks of technology, small changes in supply and demand can quickly change prices, which in turn can affect the profitability of the companies that manufacture them. After a big run-up in the sector in 2017, it wouldn't be surprising if 2018 was a quieter year.However, the long-term outlook remains positive. The world continues to evolve into one where technology and reliance on the internet plays an increasingly important part in our lives. That megatrend bodes well for aforementioned chipmakers Skyworks Solutions and Cypress Semiconductor. Skyworks' wireless connection chips enable a broad range of devices from smartphones to airplanes to get hooked up to the internet. Cypress' portfolio consists of microcontrollers, connectivity chips, memory, and software and has made considerable headway in the connected automobile industry. Even though their product lines are specialized, companies like Skyworks and Cypress can also go through cyclical fits and starts. As a general rule of thumb, when I've chosen a company I want to own long term, I use stock downturns due to supply and demand issues to buy more shares.That's why I am not too worried about the recent pullback in the semiconductor industry. With plenty of growth runway left in the world of technology, 2018 looks like a good year to add semiconductor stocks to portfolios."
Is Seagate Stock a Sell? 1 Analyst Thinks So,"Jul 13, 2017 at 2:24PM","Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) investors have endured a rough ride this past year. Up an impressive 33% over the past 12 months, shares spiked in January as signs of a resurgent market for PC hard drives began to appear -- then jumped even higher on analyst upgrades in April. The enthusiasm quickly waned, however, and today, Seagate stock is actually trading barely above where it began this year.And one analyst thinks things will get worse before they get better.BARCLAYS MAKES A CASE AGAINST HARD DISK DRIVE MANUFACTURER, SEAGATE -- BUT IT'S HARD TO DISLIKE A STOCK THIS CHEAP. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Barclays downgradesThis morning, British megabank Barclays Capital announced it is pulling its ""equalweight"" rating on Seagate shares, and downgrading Seagate stock to ""underweight."" As StreetInsider.com (requires subscription) explains in a write-up on the re-rating this morning, Barclays believes ""upside for the stock is limited."" The analyst has three main reasons for thinking this way, and two of them involved Seagate rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC).Western Digital could winWestern Digital, as you may have heard, is involved in a high-stakes, $1.1 billion lawsuit with its flash memory partner Toshiba. Toshiba is trying to sell its part of a joint venture between the two companies, but Western Digital is trying to block the sale.Toshiba says Western Digital is engaging in unfair competition with it, and has stolen ""trade secrets."" Litigation is ongoing, but Western Digital has told the court that Toshiba's claims are ""frivolous and without merit."" The litigation hasn't had much effect on Western Digital's stock price (which has surged) so far this year. Barclays' worry with respect to Seagate is that if things go well for Western Digital, that company's shares could outperform Seagate's by an even wider margin, ""de-coupl[ing]"" them from Seagate's valuation, and leaving Seagate shares in the dust.Logically, if that happens, the smart move would be for investors to dump Seagate shares and buy Western Digital instead -- which is just what Barclays seems to be advising.The ""12 TB transition""At the same time, Barclays worries that companies are beginning to transition to buying larger and larger hard drives, specifically 12 terabytes and up. Seagate is preparing to sell 12-, 14-, and even 16-TB hard drives -- but no sooner than next year. Meanwhile, Western Digital has already announced its own hard drives of these sizes. If Western Digital beats Seagate to market with its products, Barclays thinks Seagate could ""miss the 12TB transition, ceding high-margin market share to WD,"" reports StreetInsider.The trouble with Seagate stock, specificallyNor are all of Seagate's problems Western Digital-related. One of the reasons that Seagate stock is up so much over the past year (over 29%), despite its recent relapse, is that its profit margins have been surging as the company cut operating costs. Data from S&P Global Market Intelligence show that Seagate's operating profit margins surged from just 1.8% in Q1 of last year, to 7.6%, then 10.8%, then 13.9% over the ensuing quarters.Last quarter, however, Seagate's operating profit margin slipped back to 11.7%, and this has Barclays worried that ""most of the excess costs at Seagate have been purged from the system."" If profit margin growth stalls, that would remove a big reason for thinking the stock still has upside -- and could give investors even more reason to prefer Western Digital stock over Seagate.The upshot for investorsIs Barclays Capital right about all of the above worries? They certainly sound like valid concerns to me.That said, priced at 16 times earnings and with a projected 19% annual earnings growth rate, it's hard to see Seagate shares as expensive today. The more so when you consider that S&P Global data show Seagate generating $1.5 billion in annual free cash flow -- an amount twice what the company reports as GAAP net income, and a sum that gives Seagate stock a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of just 8.With a cheap share valuation and a 6.3% dividend yield to cushion any further worries about its business, I see a lot of risk already baked into Seagate's share price. Barclays may say it's time to sell it, but at these prices, I still think Seagate stock is a buy.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

5 Top Mid-Cap ETFs for 2017,"Jun 27, 2017 at 5:22PM","Mid-cap stocks are generally considered to be those with market capitalizations between $2 billion and $10 billion. Mid-cap stocks can offer better long-term growth potential than large-cap stocks, without quite as much volatility as small-cap stocks. Mid-cap ETFs that track stock indexes are a good way to invest in companies of this size without having to research and choose individual stock investments.Price wars among providers of passively managed index funds have resulted in some of the lowest ETF expense ratios in history. If you don't have the time, knowledge, or desire to pick your own stocks, index funds can be the smartest way to get stock exposure in your portfolio. In fact, Warren Buffett has said that low-cost index funds are the best investment most Americans can make.With that in mind, here are five index funds that track mid-cap stock indexes, all of which have below-average expense ratios.NameRecent Share PriceDividend YieldExpense RatioSchwab U.S. Mid-Cap ETF (NYSEMKT:SCHM)$48.241.30%0.05%Vanguard Mid-Cap Value Index Fund ETF (NYSEMKT:VOE)$103.511.93%0.07%Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth Index Fund ETF (NYSEMKT:VOT)$117.990.75%0.07%SPDR S&P 1000 ETF (NYSEMKT: SMD)$93.131.79%0.10%Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 Index Fund ETF (NYSEMKT:IVOO)$117.920.43%0.15%DATA SOURCE: TD AMERITRADE.

Schwab U.S. Mid-Cap ETFWith an expense ratio of just 0.05%, the Schwab U.S. Mid-Cap ETF has the lowest expense ratio of any mid-cap ETF as of this writing. The fund tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index, which is a broad index of stocks that fall within the mid-cap range. None of the fund's 517 current holdings represents more than 0.8% of assets, and top holdings include DXC Technology, KLA-Tencor, and Mettler-Toledo International.2. Vanguard Mid-Cap Value Index Fund ETFValue stocks are companies that trade at relatively low valuations compared to their fundamentals (earnings, dividends, etc.). Generally, these are more mature companies than growth stocks, and most pay a dividend. To give you an idea of what types of companies I'm talking about, the Vanguard Mid-Cap Value Index Fund (NYSEMKT:VOE) holds stocks such as Western Digital, Newell Brands, and M&T Bank, just to name a few of its top holdings. Finally, this ETF is highly diversified (although not as much as the Schwab fund discussed earlier), with no more than 1.4% of its assets invested in any single stock.3. Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth Index Fund ETFGrowth stocks are generally defined as companies with above-average growth rates. Since these companies typically need to use their profits to fuel growth, they tend to pay little or no dividend, which you can see by the Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth Index Fund ETF's relatively low 0.75% dividend yield. To give you an idea of the types of stocks that are classified as mid-cap growth companies, Electronic Arts, Equinix, and Fiserv are the top three holdings in the fund's portfolio.4. SPDR S&P 1000 ETFAs the name implies, the SPDR S&P 1000 ETF tracks the S&P 1000 index, which invests in mid-cap, as well as small-cap companies. Align Technology, Ansys, and Everest Re Group are the fund's top three holdings as of this writing, but there isn't much of a difference among the top 10 positions. In fact, this is the most diversified ETF on the list, with no more than 0.46% of assets invested in any single company, making this a great choice for investors who want to invest in a broad assortment of stocks, without much top-heavy asset concentration.5. Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 Index Fund ETFFrom largest companies to smallest, the major S&P indexes are the S&P 500, the S&P Mid-Cap 400, and the S&P Small-Cap 600. The previously discussed ETF invested in the S&P 1000, which includes both the small- and mid-cap indexes, while the Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 Index Fund ETF only invests in the mid-cap index. Because of this, the fund's top holdings are exactly the same as the S&P 1000 fund's -- the only difference is that they're each weighted higher because the smallest 600 stocks are now excluded. In a nutshell, this is a good choice if you want growth and value stocks and only want to invest in mid-cap companies.10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 ETFWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

My 3 Biggest Stock Holdings,"Sep 29, 2017 at 7:09PM","As an investor, I'm fairly conventional. I tend to put my money in established companies that have proven they can make a buck, and, I feel, have clear potential to make plenty more.In spite of their differences, the three stocks at the top of my portfolio broadly fit that description. All have done well on a fundamental and a stock price basis since I acquired them. I also still think they have gas in the tank. Here's a brief look at the trio.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.FacebookIs there anyone in the world who isn't on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) these days?Yes, the privacy concerns are valid, and the company apparently did business with The Wrong People in the run-up to our presidential election. But users have learned to accept and cope with the former, and don't seem to be deserting because of the latter. Facebook is far and away the go-to social media platform of our age, and it's not hyperbole to say it's the most impactful and influential site since the dawn of the Web.It's also a heck of a money maker. The company never seems to stop growing, and its margins are as lofty as CEO Mark Zuckerberg's ambitions.However, I do believe that historically hot growth will cool. I see signs of it already in the company's recent(ish) pushes -- most of my contacts rarely use the aggressively marketed live video feature, and I've yet to see anyone post an ad in the marketplace section of the site.Yet, I'm not worried. Facebook is the online connective tissue of our time, and as such is an unavoidable stop for advertisers hoping to hock their wares. The company's business model is obviously effective and sustainable, unlike a great many internet operators with whiz-bang ideas over the years. This has been a great stock to own, and I look forward to holding it in my portfolio.Western DigitalI inherited shares of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC)last year when it closed the cash-and-stock acquisition of top flash memory maker SanDisk.I didn't expect the company to perform all that well. Even with SanDisk, its core product was the soon-to-be-obsolete traditional hard drive.But numerous analyses have shown, and Western Digital's performance in the segment strongly indicates, that businesses, in particular, are reluctant to ditch those drives for solid-state models. If anything, they augment them with flash rather than replace them.At the same time, shipments of flash memory -- the only way to go in smartphones and tablets -- are growing notably. So with SanDisk, Western Digital has a grip on the future of storage, while keeping a hand firmly in the present.SanDisk is really helping the company's fundamentals. In the fiscal year 2017, Western Digital's revenue zoomed almost 50% higher to $19.1 billion, while adjusted net profit nearly doubled to $2.7 billion ($9.19 per share).In spite of its heartbreaking loss in the fight for the half of an Asian manufacturing joint venture it operated with Toshiba, analysts are still projecting robust profitability growth in the near future -- fiscal year 2018 per-share net profit is expected to grow by 36%, landing at $12.50.We're living in a world that's increasingly dependent on flash storage, while the technology's hard drive predecessor is holding on better than expected. Both developments hint at continued growth for Western Digital.TD AmeritradeThe stock of online brokerage TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) was hit hard earlier this year after rival Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) lowered its standard share trading fee from $6.95 to $4.95. This led to price cuts throughout the brokerage sector. TD Ameritrade refused to race all the way to that $4.95 bottom but did slice its fee from $9.99 to $6.95.Naturally, this has dinged its commission and transaction fee revenue -- the traditional bread-and-butter for brokerages. The line item dropped by 3.5% on a year-over-year basis in Q3. Meanwhile, TD Ameritrade more than made up for this with good, old-fashioned hustle, notching a fresh record for net new client assets.Speaking of records, the quarter's net revenue hit an all-time high, rising 11% to $931 million. And the company did a fine job taking in insured deposit account fees while boosting net interest revenue (both up 22%) and collecting more fees for investment products (up 17%).In short, TD Ameritrade is successfully strengthening its other revenue streams to reduce dependency on commission and transaction fees. In this latest quarter, these made up 58% of overall revenue, well down from Q3 2016's 73%.The company is bulking up with the just-closed acquisition of peer Scottrade. Looming Fed interest rate hikes should also boost its fundamentals. I'd characterize TD Ameritrade as a best in class stock in the (admittedly small) brokerage segment, and a keeper given its potential."
These 3 Tech Dividend Stocks Are Ridiculously Cheap,"Jul 12, 2017 at 8:48PM","Many investors buy tech stocks for growth. But with the market hovering near all-time highs, it might be smart to own some slower-growth ""mature"" tech stocks which pay dividends and trade at lower valuations. Here are three stocks which fit that bill -- Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), and Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN).QualcommQualcomm, the biggest mobile chipmaker in the world, pays a forward yield of 4.1%. It's raised that dividend every year since it started paying it in 2003. That trend should continue for the foreseeable future, since the compeny only spent 70% of its earnings and 56% of its free cash flow on dividends over the past 12 months.SOURCE: GETTY.Qualcomm is also fundamentally cheap at 19 times earnings, which is lower than the industry average P/E of 24 for semiconductor makers. But analysts expect its revenue and earnings to respectively fall 3% and 4% this year, as its chipmaking unit cedes market share to cheaper rivals and first-party chips from device makers, and its higher-margin licensing business continues to face pressure from regulators, rivals, and customers, which all claim that its licensing practices are anti-competitive.Those challenges seem daunting, but Qualcomm is aggressively expanding into adjacent markets like wearables, drones, cars, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices to offset the challenges to its mobile business. It also plans to acquire NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), which would make it the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world and expand its serviceable addressable markets by about 40% in 2020. If that deal closes, Qualcomm will evolve into a better diversified chipmaker with more sustainable growth.SeagateHard drive maker Seagate pays a forward yield of 6.6%. Seagate hasn't raised that payout since 2015, but it only spent 77% of its earnings and 38% of its free cash flow on those payments over the past 12 months, indicating that it has plenty of room to continue making payments, and maybe even make hikes in the future.Seagate stopped raising its dividend due to cash flow concerns, but its free cash flow growth rebounded over the past year on stronger sales of its enterprise storage products. Unlike its bigger rival Western Digital, Seagate doesn't have a major presence in the higher-growth SSD (solid-state drive) market or flash memory. However, Seagate compensates for that weakness with partnerships with memory makers Micron and SK Hynix.Analysts expect Seagate's revenue to dip 2% this year, but for its earnings -- which are boosted by better cost controls and share buybacks -- to nearly double. This makes Seagate a fairly cheap play at 16 times earnings, which is much lower than the industry average P/E of 70 for data storage providers.GarminGPS maker Garmin pays a forward yield of 4%. It spent 73% of its earnings and 82% of its free cash flow on that dividend over the past 12 months, but it hasn't raised that payout since 2015. However, Garmin remains a cheap stock at 14 times earnings, which is less than half the industry average P/E of 30 for scientific and technical instrument makers.SOURCE: GARMIN.Wall Street expects Garmin's revenue to stay flat this year, and for its earnings to decline 5%. Those declines are attributed to its transition away from its shrinking automotive GPS business (which are being displaced by smartphones and in-dash units) toward higher sales of GPS devices for marine, aviation, and outdoor uses. It also owns a growing wearables business, which made it the fifth largest wearables maker in the world during the first quarter of 2017 according to research firm IDC.Analysts expect that transition to produce better growth next year as revenue and earnings respectively rise 1% and 2%. Those aren't jaw-dropping growth figures, but they should make Garmin a fairly reliable income play for the foreseeable future. The key takeawaysQualcomm, Seagate, and Garmin definitely aren't rocket ship stocks, and they have obvious weaknesses. Qualcomm still needs to weather the regulatory headwinds and close the NXP deal, Seagate must address waning sales of traditional HDDs (hard disk drives), and Garmin must continue growing its higher-growth businesses to offset its automotive declines. Nonetheless, all three companies should interest investors looking for cheap stocks with high yields."
"Why Western Digital, Westport Fuel Systems, and Ferroglobe Slumped Today","Mar 23, 2018 at 4:56PM","Wall Street suffered another crushing blow on Friday, with the Dow closing down 425 points and finishing a week in which the benchmark average lost more than 1,400 points. Most investors focused their attention on the trade front, making dire conclusions about the potential for escalating tensions between the U.S. and major trading partners across the globe. Yet others simply pointed to the fact that the market failed to return to record highs after its early February correction, and major benchmarks stand on the precipice of falling below their worst levels from last month. Not helping matters was bad news from several individual companies whose shares fell more precipitously than stocks did overall. Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Westport Fuel Systems (NASDAQ:WPRT), and Ferroglobe (NASDAQ:GSM) were among the worst performers on the day. Here's why they did so poorly.Western Digital falls in sympathyShares of Western Digital dropped more than 8%, reacting as one of its key rivals in the memory-chip space fell sharply despite a relatively positive earnings report for its fiscal second quarter. Micron Technology reported a nearly 60% jump in sales, with adjusted net income more than tripling from year-ago levels. Yet analysts were concerned that the entire memory-chip market could be hitting a peak, especially with some major players choosing to boost production and potentially exacerbate the next downward phase of the endlessly cyclical industry. Even with today's drop, Western Digital shares have still doubled in less than two years, and many see more potential for gains.IMAGE SOURCE: WESTERN DIGITAL.Westport hits the brakesWestport Fuel Systems stock fell 11.5% after the company announced a loss in the fourth quarter. The maker of natural gas-powered engine systems emphasized the business gains that it had made in 2017, which included major strategic decisions to refocus on core businesses and a massive debt restructuring to improve its balance sheet strength. The launch of Westport's HPDI 2.0 system for the heavy-duty truck market was important, but the company still identified a number of strategic necessities for the coming year that will require strong execution. Until Westport gets further along in its turnaround efforts, shareholders will likely see continued pressure on the stock.Ferroglobe loses the battleFinally, shares of Ferroglobe plunged nearly 24%. The maker of silicon raw materials for use in solar modules and other components had filed a petition alleging trade violations by silicon producers in three countries, including Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan. Yet although the Commerce Department found that there were transactions at less than fair market value, the International Trade Commission didn't find evidence of material injury to the market. Shareholders seemed surprised at the decision not to impose anti-dumping duties, although some bullish investors think that the silicon market is still fundamentally strong enough to support Ferroglobe's underlying business.10 stocks we like better than Western DigitalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Is Seagate Technology a Buy at Its 52-Week High?,"Apr 2, 2018 at 10:08PM","Seagate Technology's (NASDAQ:STX) recent recovery has been rewarded handsomely by investors. Shares of the storage specialist have soared remarkably over the past few months and as of this writing sit at 52-week high, thanks largely to impressive cost control measures and the increasing demand for its storage products and solutions.But concerns have been raised about the sustainability of Seagate's terrific run as rival Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) aggressive move into the solid-state drive (SSD) business after the SanDisk acquisition has given it an upper hand.STX DATA BY YCHARTSWhat's more, Western Digital has set itself up for long-term growth thanks to the growing demand for flash-based storage, while Seagate continues to bet on the legacy hard-disk drive (HDD) market. So, will Seagate's strategy of sticking to the HDD business pay off in the long run and help the stock soar higher? Let's take a look.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Seagate's HDDs are gaining tractionSeagate's focus on the HDD market, as opposed to the fast-growing SSD market, has weighed on its top line in recent quarters, but things are gradually improving. For instance, revenue in the December-ended quarter revenue was flat year over year, and its top line should remain in good shape thanks to the positive end-market dynamics.PC shipments, for example, are finally getting better. Gartner estimates that PC sales will rise by 2 million units in 2018, and gain more traction in 2019 with sales expected to rise by 3 million units. The market was at 270 million units in 2016.Meanwhile, enterprise cloud storage is expected to grow at almost 24% a year through 2022, driven by the growing demand for hybrid cloud storage and other applications such as enterprise mobile management. HDDs are expected to play a crucial role in satisfying this demand thanks to their cost advantage over solid-state drives.A 512GB HDD, for example, retails online in a range of $44 to $65, while an SSD with identical capacity goes for anywhere between $140 to $170, according to data storage provider Backblaze. Demand for Seagate's HDD products has taken off in recent quarters as data centers need a cost-effective solution to store such large amounts of data. The company shipped 87.5 exabytes of HDD capacity last quarter, up 28% from the prior-year period.Looking ahead, Seagate should be able to maintain its hold on the enterprise storage market thanks to its focus on coming out with larger HDDs, which should also boost margins.Seagate's earnings power will improveSeagate's focus on optimizing its operational efficiency has led to massive cost reductions in recent quarters as it has scaled down its manufacturing footprint. Last year, the company had announced that it was shutting down one of its largest HDD manufacturing plants in China as the market is moving toward higher-capacity drives.In fact, Seagate's average capacity per drive increased to 2.2 TB last quarter as compared to 1.7 TB in the year-ago period. As a result, the number of HDD units the company shipped fell slightly year over year last quarter -- so Seagate now needs to make fewer hard drives because it is packing more memory into each unit, leading to a leaner manufacturing footprint.This is why the company's operating expenses fell 15% year over year last quarter. What's more, Seagate expects its operating expenses to drop another 2% to 3% sequentially in the current quarter. More importantly, the company should be able to limit its expenses in the long run as it is working on the introduction of higher-capacity drives.Seagate recently started pilot shipments of hard drives based on Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) technology and expects to start shipping HDDs with 20 TB-plus capacities by next year. By comparison, Seagate's 10 TB and 12 TB products are currently its best-selling offerings.So, the company is looking to aggressively push up the storage density of its drives, and it aims to roll out HDDs with capacities of 40 TB or higher by 2023. Seagate believes that this increase in the storage density of an HDD will allow data center operators to reduce the total cost of operation significantly.Moreover, the company should be able to consolidate its manufacturing footprint further by making bigger HDDs, which should lead to lower operating expenses and bigger profits. Analysts expect Seagate's earnings to increase at 8.4% a year for the next five years. By comparison, the company's bottom line has shrunk by almost 9% a year for the past five years.Attractively valuedSeagate's valuation indicates that there's still room for more upside. The stock's trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.6 is much lower than rival Western Digital's P/E of almost 80. What's more, Seagate stock gets cheaper on a forward P/E basis with a multiple of just 12.Also, Seagate's dividend yield of 4.2% gives investors yet another solid reason to invest in the stock despite its terrific run in recent months. All in all, the company is making smart moves to tap the growing storage demand, trades at an attractive valuation, and carries a hefty dividend yield, so there's no reason why investors shouldn't think of adding Seagate shares to their portfolio."
Seagate Technology Had a Good Quarter,"Jan 26, 2018 at 7:47AM","Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) has been in fine form of late, appreciating over 30% in the past six months thanks to a better-than-expected quarterly report in October 2017. The data storage specialist trumped earnings expectations by a wide margin because of stringent cost controls, thereby boosting investor confidence.The company is set to report second-quarter results on Jan. 29. Investors have already gotten a look at some of the numbers and will be tuning in to get the full picture next week. IMAGE SOURCE: SEAGATE.Preliminary results indicate continue improvementSeagate announced selected preliminary second-quarter results on Jan. 8 and the stock climbed in response. The company noted that it will be reporting $2.9 billion in second-quarter revenue, as well as a non-GAAP gross margin of 30%. This compares favorably to Seagate's original expectation of $2.73 billion in revenue, indicating that demand for its storage products and solutions is improving.In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Seagate's revenue was down almost 6% year over year. Now in the second quarter, the company's revenue will remain flat compared to the prior-year period. This improvement in Seagate's top line is a result of an increase in demand for the company's hard-disk drives (HDDs).Seagate shipped a record 88 exabytes of storage capacity during the second quarter, up 29% over the prior-year quarter, and the average capacity per HDD rose from 1.7 terabytes last year to 2.2 terabytes (TB) this time. Meanwhile, the number of HDD units shipped by Seagate remained constant at 40 million. This increase in the average capacity per drive has helped Seagate reduce its operating expenses substantially.This is because HDDs with a higher storage capacity have a lower per-gigabyte cost, so they carry stronger margins. As a result, Seagate's operating expenses will decline almost 15% from the prior-year period, and this should help the company's bottom line.Seagate looks set to deliver another round of appealing quarterly results, and a strong guidance could be the icing on the cake.Why Seagate's turnaround will continueThere's a growing market for HDD as their cost advantage over solid-state drives makes them ideal to address high-capacity storage requirements in data centers. The cloud storage market is expected to clock a compound annual growth rate of 25.8% through 2021, according to Markets and Markets.This gives Seagate's total capacity shipments the room to run higher and boost its revenue. And the company's strategy of moving toward higher-capacity drives should help it lower costs and enhance margins. For instance, the company sees a market for 16TB hard drives over the next 12 to 18 months.By comparison, the top-selling enterprise storage product in Seagate's lineup has a capacity of 10TB. As it stands, sales of its 10TB HDDs shot up threefold in the September-ended quarter as compared to the previous quarter. Meanwhile, Seagate had earlier reported that its 12TB storage product has also started gaining traction, and this could have been one of the key drivers behind the jump in capacity shipments in the quarter.The good news is that Seagate will continue pushing the envelope on HDD capacity. The company is reportedly working on a 20TB HDD that it plans to bring to the market in 2019. But before that, it is expected to launch a 16TB HDD this year to take the throne of the highest-capacity HDD provider from rival Western Digital.Seagate will report its results before the market opens Jan. 29 and management will hold a conference call with analysts at 9 a.m. Eastern time. Investors can access the event at the company's investor relations website."
What to Expect From Marvell Technologyâ€™s Q4 Earnings,"Mar 6, 2018 at 11:01PM","Marvell Technology Group's (NASDAQ:MRVL) fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 report on March 8 is going to be closely watched by investors, who have been betting on a Marvell turnaround for over two years now.MRVL DATA BY YCHARTS. TTM = TRAILING 12 MONTHS.Here's what to look for.IMAGE SOURCE: MARVELL TECHNOLOGY GROUP. Growth will get back on trackMarvell is expected to have earned $0.31 per share on revenue of $611 million during the fourth quarter, which compares favorably to the previous year's earnings of $0.22 per share and revenue of $571.4 million. The consensus estimates are in line with the midpoint of the company's own guidance.If Marvell hits the midpoint of its top-line guidance, its revenue will increase close to 7% year over year. By comparison, the company's top line dropped 5% year over year during the same period last year. A turnaround in Marvell's fortunes will be driven by improving traction in the storage and networking businesses, which have impressive catalysts.For instance, the growing demand for solid-state drives (SSDs) is crucial in driving the storage business. The company's storage-related revenue increased 10% during the first nine months of the fiscal year thanks to a huge ramp-up in SSD demand. Marvell management estimates that SSDs could contribute as much as 30% of its storage sales this year -- good from a long-term perspective given the substantial growth available here.Meanwhile, Marvell's recently launched automotive connectivity products are positively impacting its business. During the third quarter, the company's connectivity revenue had increased an impressive 19% year over year. Automotive could have played a key role in this jump as the company was already in negotiations with potential customers to deploy its connectivity products.So, Marvell looks all set to release a strong quarterly report and a sunny outlook.Looking at the long runI have already mentioned that automotive and SSDs are the two key catalysts boosting Marvell's top line, and both these areas should gain more traction in the coming quarters. For instance, the chipmaker is engaged with leading Tier 1 automotive component suppliers to build next-generation high-speed networks to enable secure connectivity in self-driving cars.Though the initial revenue ramp-up from the automotive segment is going to be modest, according to management, it should prove to be a big growth driver in the long run. Market researcher TechNavio estimates that the global automotive Ethernet market will expand at an annual pace of 42% for the next four years. Marvell is going after this opportunity with a secure automotive gigabit Ethernet switch that it claims to be an industry first.Meanwhile, the impending acquisition of Cavium, expected to close soon, will increase Marvell's addressable market by $8 billion by giving it access to the data-center switching space. So the growth of the chipmaker's networking and connectivity business segments, which together account for 41% of total revenue, looks secure for the long run.The storage business will be driven by the growing proliferation of SSDs. Marvell makes storage controllers that are used in solid-state drives, and it supplies these chips to both Western Digital and Seagate. The SSD market is expected to grow 14.7% annually over the next five years, driven by its growing adoption in cloud computing and data centers. Marvell looks well placed to tap this growth thanks to its relationship with Western Digital and Seagate.The bottom line is that Marvell Technology is going after fast-growing areas to drive growth. Analysts believe that the catalysts discussed above could boost its earnings at an annual rate of over 22% for the next five years, and a strong set of results this week should confirm that it is capable of achieving the same.10 stocks we like better than Marvell Technology GroupWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Top 3 Ripple Stocks,"Jan 22, 2018 at 9:36AM","Feel free to stand in awe of the cryptocurrency market, because we've never seen anything like it before. In a span of 12 1/2 months, the aggregate value of all digital currencies combined has jumped from $17.7 billion to about $702 billion, as of midday Jan. 15, 2018. This works out to a nearly 3,900% increase in value for cryptocurrencies in just over a year, and it probably represents the single-greatest 12 1/2-month stretch for an asset class in history.As you've probably guessed, bitcoin gets a lot of the credit for this rally in virtual coins. It was, after all, the very first tradeable digital currency, and it's currently the virtual coin that merchants around the world are most likely to accept. Bitcoin also helped bring blockchain technology into the mainstream -- blockchain being the digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger responsible for logging all transactions without the need for a financial intermediary, like a bank.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Ripple emerges from bitcoin's shadowBut for as good as bitcoin has been, the cryptocurrencies in its rearview mirror have been even better. Ripple, which briefly made a run to almost $150 billion in market cap earlier this month, is one such virtual currency that's dazzled crypto-enthusiasts.As with many cryptocurrencies, the buzz surrounding Ripple relates to its blockchain. More specifically, Ripple is angling its blockchain at large financial institutions in an effort to correct many perceived flaws with today's banking system. These flaws include extended wait times for the settling of transactions (especially cross-border transactions), high transaction fees since a third party is involved, and even security.Ripple's blockchain corrects each and every one of these issues. In particular, its network is capable of completing transactions in around three to four seconds, and these transactions cost just fractions of a cent. Perhaps the most attractive aspect of Ripple's blockchain is that cross-border payments, which may have up to a three- to five-day hold with today's banking system, can settle almost instantly.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The top Ripple stocks you should knowNevertheless, buying into Ripple and its XRP coin means having to trade on decentralized exchanges, which isn't exactly everyone's cup of tea. Thankfully, a handful of stocks are deploying Ripple's technology within their networks in smaller-scale real-world tests. If you want a piece of the Ripple pie through more traditional markets, these are top Ripple stocks you need to know about.1 and 2. American Express and Banco SantanderThe reason financial-services giant American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Spain's Banco Santander (NYSE:SAN) are listed together is that they're part of a partnership that's currently testing Ripple's blockchain in instantly settling cross-border transactions.The deal, announced in November, will allow U.S. based American Express users to send non-card payments over the AmEx FX International Payment network to U.K. Santander accounts and will process these transactions within Ripple's blockchain. Ripple touts the ability to settle these payments instantly, which would be light-years ahead of the three- to five-day wait time usually seen when banks verify a cross-border payment. If all goes well, Ripple would hope that AmEx and Banco Santander expand their usage of Ripple's blockchain to other parts of the world. Of course, investors should keep in mind that for both American Express and Banco Santander, this blockchain test represents a minuscule amount of its everyday business. American Express is entrenched as a credit service provider for affluent consumers and businesses, while Banco Santander makes its home in Spain and other European countries. It'll be great for Ripple if this partnership bears fruit, but if it doesn't, it'll have little bearing for AmEx or Banco Santander.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.3. MoneyGram InternationalOn the other hand, money-transfer service MoneyGram International (NASDAQ:MGI) appears to be more intricately tied at the hip to Ripple than any other stock.On Jan. 11, Ripple and MoneyGram International announced that they'd entered into a partnership to expedite payment flows by utilizing Ripple's XRP coin. Aside from this on-demand liquidity solution, which Ripple refers to as xRapid, the two will explore MoneyGram's integration into Ripple's ecosystem through xVia, according to MoneyGram's press release. The expectation of this partnership is that it'll result in significantly quicker transfer settlement times, and in the process also dramatically lower cross-border transaction costs. Perhaps the only thing unclear here is if this'll mean lower transaction costs for the consumer, or if MoneyGram International is simply going to boost its margins. My guess is it'll be a bit of both, which would allow MoneyGram's lower transaction costs to undercut its primary competitor, Western Union.The beauty of this deal is that it really allows Ripple to showcase its coin. Imagine someone in the U.S. sending currency in dollars to someone else in Mexico. With this deal, the U.S. dollars will convert almost instantly into XRP coins, and then those coins will be converted into Mexican pesos, once again almost instantly.If there's a Ripple stock worth eyeing the closest, I'd suggest it's MoneyGram International.Bitcoin is overhyped: 10 better buys for you nowWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 High-Yield Tech Stocks,"Feb 6, 2018 at 4:08PM","As many people search for the best high-yield dividend stocks, the fast-changing tech sector is often the last place they look. But make no mistake; some of the market's most promising dividend stocks hail from the world of technology.So we asked three top Motley Fool investors to each pick a high-yield tech stock that they believe investors would be wise to consider today. Read on to learn why they chose Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX).IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGESA juicy yield from a telecom giantSteve Symington (Verizon Communications): Things were looking up for Verizon shareholders after the company's latest quarterly results exceeded expectations two weeks ago. But the telecommunications leader has all but given up those gains as the broader market pulled back hard over the past few days.However -- keeping in mind Verizon has increased its dividend for 11 straight years -- patient investors can take solace knowing that its dividend yields around 4.72% annually as of this writing. And its underlying wireless business remains strong, with the company adding an impressive 1.2 million retail postpaid wireless subscribers last quarter. Verizon also achieved healthy postpaid phone churn of 0.77%, demonstrating exceptional customer loyalty and marking its 11th straight period of keeping the metric under 0.9%.What's more, that loyalty should be cemented with Verizon's planned commercial launch of its next-generation 5G network in 2018. Though to be fair, investors should watch closely to ensure the Trump administration doesn't follow through with potentially disastrous plans to nationalize the wireless industry.Meanwhile, Verizon is expected to benefit greatly from recent U.S. tax reform initiatives, with management estimating the changes will result in a net increase to cash flow from operations in the range of $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion this year. Add to that the potential for incremental growth from Verizon's Oath media subsidiary -- which generated revenue of $2.2 billion last quarter from dozens of leading media brands including the likes of Yahoo, AOL, TechCrunch, HuffPost, and Engadget, to name only a few -- and Verizon could be a fantastic bet for yield-hungry shareholders looking for a place to put their money to work.A return to growthTim Green (Cisco Systems): Shares of enterprise networking hardware vendor Cisco Systems shot up nearly 27% last year, outpacing the broader market. After two years of slumping quarterly revenue, the company forecast a return to growth in its fiscal second quarter, results for which will be announced on Feb. 14. Cisco's ongoing shift to subscriptions and recurring revenue, while painful in the short term as revenue is pushed out into the future, is finally starting to pay off.This rise in the stock price has pushed down Cisco's dividend yield, but the stock still offers a yield far higher than the S&P 500. Based on Cisco's latest quarterly dividend payment, shares of the tech company sport a yield of about 2.8%. And Cisco will likely announce a dividend increase in the next month or so, if history is any indication.Cisco's dividend currently eats up a little less than $6 billion annually, less than half the company's annual free cash flow. Cisco will likely provide an update when it reports its results in February about how the tax bill will affect the company's results. A lower corporate tax rate coupled with the repatriation of foreign cash could lead Cisco to accelerate its dividend growth.Cisco stock trades for less than 16 times its fiscal 2017 free cash flow. That ratio drops further if you back out the net cash on Cisco's balance sheet. If you want a high-yield tech stock trading for a reasonable price, look no further than Cisco.Imperfect, inexpensive, with incredible dividendsAnders Bylund (Seagate Technology): The hard-drive manufacturer certainly qualifies as a high-yielder, thanks to a beefy 4.9% dividend yield at current share prices. That torrential cash spigot becomes even more impressive when you consider that Seagate's stock gained 40% in January and 54% over the last six months -- if you bought shares in early August, you'd be looking at an effective yield of 7.5% right now.The company is not an out-and-out Dividend Aristocrat, but rather an opportunistic booster of dividend check amounts. The quarterly payout has been stuck at $0.63 per share since the fall of 2015, freezing Seagate's dividend and freeing management to put its surplus cash to other use. That being said, the annual payout has increased by 250% over the last seven years.STX DIVIDEND DATA BY YCHARTSNone of this matters if the company is going down the drain, of course. I have been a skeptic because Seagate is lagging behind nemesis Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) in terms of addressing the rise of solid-state storage devices -- high-speed tools built around memory chips rather than spinning magnetic discs. The company is winning me over in two ways:Traditional hard drives seem to have a long-term ticket to ride the enterprise sector. Seagate's sales to large corporations with enormous data storage needs are booming, thanks to the lower cost of large disc-based drives. That trend might even have legs after all.Seagate recently signed a long-term supply deal with memory chip maker Toshiba (NASDAQOTH:TOSBF), showing that management is considering new ideas.So you're taking on some risk with this investment, but Seagate's generous dividends just might be worth it.10 stocks we like better than Cisco SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2 Cheap Dividend Stocks You Shouldnâ€™t Miss,"Jan 29, 2018 at 6:06PM","The technology sector's average dividend yield is just 1.2% because companies in this sector try to stay ahead of the curve by reinvesting earnings into their business, with top-line growth and market share gains as their top priorities. In fact, industrial goods and healthcare are the only two sectors that rank below tech when it comes to yields. But there are certain names in the tech sector that could be an income investor's dream.In this article, I look at two such tech stocks -- Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) -- that carry nice dividend yields. What's more, both companies are cheaply valued, so investors don't have to pay outrageously to take advantage of their fat yields.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Cisco SystemsCisco has been paying a dividend since 2011, and has raised it every year.CSCO DIVIDEND DATA BY YCHARTSThe stock currently sports a forward annual dividend yield of 2.8%, significantly higher than the technology sector's average. More important, its payout ratio of 52.5% isn't too aggressive, either, so it shouldn't have much difficulty in sustaining its dividend.But investors need to know that Cisco is in the midst of a transformation. The company has realized that it needs to change its business model from selling devices such as routers and switches to software-centric offerings, so it has become more flexible and has started software sales independent of the underlying hardware.This transformation hasn't been without pain for Cisco. In the last reported quarter, its net income grew 3% year over year to $2.4 billion even though revenue dropped 2%. But the outlook for the second quarter calls for year-over-year revenue growth between 1% and 3%, indicating that things are gradually getting better.The good news is that Cisco's switch toward software is gaining traction. It got 32% of its revenue from recurring sources in the last-reported quarter, an increase of 3 percentage points from the year-ago period. A higher proportion of recurring revenue bodes well for Cisco, because its spending on customer acquisition and servicing will ideally drop. This is probably why the company's earnings increased despite a shaky top-line performance last quarter.More important, the contribution of recurring revenue sources to Cisco's top line will keep increasing given the growth in its deferred revenue. Last quarter, the company's deferred revenue related to software and subscription sales increased 37%, outpacing the 10% jump in overall deferred revenue.Analysts expect Cisco's bottom line to grow at almost 9% a year over the next five years, which is substantially higher than the 4.8% growth it has clocked over the last five. So Cisco looks well positioned to keep raising its dividend in the long run as the shift in its business model will accelerate bottom-line growth, making the stock an enticing pick considering its valuation.Cisco trades at 21.5 times last year's earnings, significantly below the 34.9 industry average. The stock's forward earnings multiple of 16.8 makes it even more attractive, since it points toward a stronger earnings performance going forward.In all, Cisco's business is moving in the right direction, making it a top pick for investors looking for a cheap dividend-paying stock.Seagate TechnologyStorage specialist Seagate Technology sports a really fat dividend yield of 4.9%. It has been paying a dividend for 15 years now, though its last dividend hike came almost three years ago. Still, investors shouldn't be complaining, because the size of the company's dividend is quite substantial.Its payout ratio of 58.3% looks very aggressive when compared to rival Western Digital, which has a 16.4% payout ratio. But Seagate seems quite capable of maintaining its impressive payout, or even increasing it down the line because of its focus on earnings growth.STX NET INCOME (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTSSeagate's net income rose 8.3% year over year during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, with its gross margin coming in at 28%. The company's gross margin during the second quarter will rise to 30%, while its operating expenses will drop in the ballpark of 3% to 5% sequentially. So Seagate looks set for stronger earnings growth once again, a trend that it should be able to maintain for a long time.Seagate is benefiting from the broader industry trend of an increase in the average storage capacity of drives, which is helping it push down costs. The company shipped 88 exabytes of hard-disk drive (HDD) capacity during the recently concluded second quarter, a jump of 29% from the prior-year period.But at the same time, HDD unit shipments were almost flat year over year at 40 million units, pushing the average capacity per HDD to 2.2 terabytes from 1.7 terabytes in the year-ago period. So Seagate is packing more memory into each hard drive to meet the rising enterprise demand, improving its cost profile.This is because the cost per gigabyte of a drive declines as the size of the HDD increases, raising Seagate's profitability in the process. Data storage demand is expected to rise fourfold by 2025, so the average capacity of an HDD should keep rising. In fact, the possibility of a 100 terabyte HDD by 2025 cannot be ruled out as storage density increases.Seagate, therefore, looks primed for strong earnings growth, with analysts estimating a 15% compound annual earnings growth for the next five years as compared to an annual earnings erosion of 13% during the last half-decade.Finally, Seagate is cheaply valued. It trades at 11.9 times forward earnings, compared to the 25.5 industry average, making it an ideal pick for investors looking for a combination of earnings growth and a fat dividend at an attractive price."
Why Seagate Technology PLC Stock Rose 32% in January,"Feb 5, 2018 at 12:00PM","What happenedShares of Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) gained 31.9% in January, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Strong business results did the heavy lifting for this hard-drive maker, but Seagate also got a boost from a large cryptocurrency investment.So whatSeagate shares rose 7% on Jan. 8 alone, driven by unofficial reports that the company was an early investor in Ripple. That company backs the eponymous Ripple cryptocurrency, or XRP, which has grown into one of the largest crypto-coins on the market today. The value of the tokens has skyrocketed 113 times higher over the last 12 months, so if Seagate's early investment included any ownership of XRP coins, that would have potentially added billions of dollars to Seagate's enterprise value. Its investment in Ripple also positions Seagate as an early adopter and supporter of blockchain technologies, though it's unclear exactly how that foresight might help a maker of data-storage hardware.The company pre-announced its second-quarter results that day, adding fuel to the fire with surprisingly strong top-line sales and wider profit margins. Three weeks later, the final report added color commentary and fuller financial details, but the basic story was still the same: Seagate is selling a lot of enterprise-grade hard drives these days.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Now whatI happen to prefer Seagate's archrival, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), for the simple reason that it seems better positioned for long-term success in a world that's moving deeper into solid-state storage devices. But Seagate has found a comfortable niche where its focus on reliable and affordable bulk storage might keep it relevant for a few more years. And the company is attempting to address the SSD issue by partnering up with major memory-chip supplier Toshiba (NASDAQOTH:TOSBF).Between surprisingly solid hard-drive sales and that forward-thinking Ripple investment, Seagate sure seems to be on a roll right now. I'm not convinced that the market momentum will carry this stock much higher, but many investors were optimistic in January.10 stocks we like better than Seagate TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

5 Cryptocurrencies That Have Brand-Name Partners,"Jan 29, 2018 at 9:36AM","Since the beginning of 2017, cryptocurrencies have been what dreams are made of for those with the wherewithal to invest in them. Though exceptionally risky and largely unproven, the combined value of all digital currencies soared by more than 3,300% last year to $613 billion, and just weeks ago, they touched as high as $835 billion. In just one year, investors were treated to what amounts to a lifetime of gains.The rise of cryptocurrencies has a lot to do with the emergence of blockchain technology. Blockchain is the digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger responsible for logging all transactions without the need for a financial intermediary. It's designed to fix a number of perceived issues with the current banking system, including excessive transaction fees and long wait times for payments to settle. With blockchain, transactions have the opportunity to settle almost instantly (even with cross-border payments), and there's no bank (i.e., third-party) involvement, meaning there's the real chance of lower transaction fees.To a lesser extent, investors are also excited about the potential for using virtual currencies in place of traditional paper currencies to buy goods and services.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.These digital currencies are turning heads among big businessesBut the long-term value of cryptocurrencies will likely be determined by their ability to land partnerships and deals with brand-name businesses. The easiest way for digital currencies to distance themselves from what are now nearly 1,500 investable cryptocurrencies is by doing well through brand-name partnerships. The following five cryptocurrencies have done just that.1. BitcoinNo surprise here. Bitcoin, the world's oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, has more than a handful of brand-name partners willing to accept its tokens as a form of payment.It all began in 2014 with online home-goods retailer Overstock.com, which is itself an ambassador of digital currency acceptance among retailers. Bitcoin also added Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH), PayPal, and Intuit as payment partners that year. Microsoft allows users to purchase content in the Windows and Xbox stores using bitcoin, while DISH announced its intention to accept the most popular digital token as a form of payment for its content services. Since adding these partners, bitcoin has continued to expand its merchant network. Unlike the other cryptocurrencies on this list, bitcoin is less concerned with marketing its blockchain technology to enterprises, and has focused its efforts on signing up merchants and replacing traditional paper currencies. Nevertheless, it's responsible for putting blockchain technology in the limelight, and its blockchain is the basis of evolution for many of the proprietary blockchains we see being developed today.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.2. EthereumIf there were a trophy to hand out for most brand-name involvement, Ethereum would almost certainly have to win. Despite its Ether token having little use at the moment beyond paying for transaction fees on its network, Ethereum has a small army of big businesses currently testing a version of its blockchain.Formed in February 2017, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance includes approximately 200 organizations from a variety of industries that are testing a version of Ethereum's blockchain in demos and small-scale projects. These brand-name testers include JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, Intel, Mastercard, Credit Suisse, and BP (NYSE:BP), to name just a few. In particular, BP is testing the capabilities of Ethereum's blockchain to expedite energy futures trading settlements. Ethereum was also the first major cryptocurrency to signal to the world that blockchain has applications beyond just currency. Tech and retail applications of Ethereum's customizable blockchain can aid in supply chain management and network oversight.The secret sauce to Ethereum's success are its smart contracts. These are customizable protocols that help to verify, facilitate, or enforce the negotiation of a contract. Since paper contracts are viewed as legally flimsy and inefficient, legally binding digital records via blockchain that are backed by smart contract protocols are quite appealing to big businesses.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.3. RippleOne virtual currency that emerged from bitcoin's shadow in a big way last year was Ripple. It was among the top-performing cryptocurrencies in 2017, with its XRP coin gaining more than 35,500%. Since mid-November, Ripple, which has marketed its blockchain technology to global financial service companies, has announced two partnerships with brand-name businesses.In mid-November, Ripple announced that American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Banco Santander (NYSE:SAN) would be using its blockchain in a real-world cross-border payment test. American Express users who send noncard payments over AmEx's FX International Payment network to U.K. Santander accounts will have those transactions processed through Ripple's blockchain. Rather than these payments taking up to five days to clear, Ripple is figuring on virtually instant settlements.Then, earlier this month, Ripple announced a partnership with money transfer service MoneyGram International (NASDAQ:MGI) that's designed to expedite the time it takes to move money around the globe. MoneyGram should be able to convert the currency of the origin country to XRP coins, then convert those coins into the currency of the destination country, all within a matter of seconds. Plus, Ripple's transactions cost just a fraction of a penny, which could be a major selling point over the high transaction fees of rival Western Union.With an exceptionally quick transaction speed relative to bitcoin and Ethereum, you could rightly say that Ripple is making waves. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.4. StellarThough it stayed under the radar for much of 2017, Stellar exploded onto the scene in a big way in October when it announced blockchain partnerships with both computing giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) and KlickEx, a Polynesian currency exchange service.Unlike Ripple and its focus on big banks, Stellar seems perfectly comfortable going after multinational businesses. Its current partnership with IBM entails having a dozen big banks in the South Pacific region deploy Stellar's blockchain technology in order to quickly settle and validate payments from customers. IBM generates tens of billions of dollars from overseas clients, but these payments can often take days to clear since they're cross-border transactions. Stellar's blockchain is designed to proof these payments in a matter of seconds, perhaps improving order efficiency and cash flow for Big Blue. Though not publicly traded, global financial management services firm Deloitte also has a working partnership with Stellar. Back in July 2016, Stellar announced a partnership with Deloitte to develop custom-built mobile applications, as well as a digital banking platform for businesses, which included invoice tracking and reference numbers. And, as usual, Stellar promised transaction resolution in around five seconds. If it can scale and maintain these quick processing times, Stellar may soon give the big boys (bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple) a run for their money.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.5. QtumBut if you want to really dip below the radar, yet still find a cryptocurrency capable of landing big-name partners, Qtum is the digital currency to dig into. What makes Qtum's blockchain so attractive is that it combines bitcoin's popular core infrastructure with Ethereum's Virtual Machine and smart protocols. It basically takes the most popular features of both cryptocurrencies, adds in mobile applications, and ensures that the network will remain backward compatible with existing bitcoin gateways and Ethereum contracts despite future upgrades.This month, the Qtum Foundation announced that it had partnered with two major Chinese companies. First, Qtum is working with 360 Finance, a subsidiary of the now-private Qihoo 360. If the name sounds familiar, it's because Qihoo 360 is the company behind the 360 Search engine in China, which has about 10% market share (third-highest in China). The Qtum Foundation, along with the 360 Blockchain Research Center and BTN Foundation, will work to develop next-generation smart contract solutions.The second partnership, which was announced a mere day after the first, is with Baofeng Bokocloud. Though that's not a name folks in the U.S. might be familiar with, Baofeng's media player is one of the most popular video and streaming services in China, with over 200 million users. The two will work to achieve the world's first blockchain consensus network service, with Baofeng using Qtum's blockchain to strength its copyright protections and to handle payments made by users to the company.Qtum has suggested that these are two of five major partnerships it'll announce in 2018.

3 Stocks You Can Safely Own Until 2030,"Mar 12, 2018 at 7:47PM","What's better than a fantastic investment for today? One that will keep rewarding you over the long run, of course. Compounding returns over many years, or even decades, is the magic wand that turns today's modest investments into tomorrow's millionaires.So we asked a few of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool to share their best ideas for stocks that will keep on giving for many years to come. Here's why our panelists would trust Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), American Tower (NYSE:AMT), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) to deliver market-beating returns for at least the next 12 years.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Coffee is a safe betDemitri Kalogeropoulos (Starbucks): People have been sipping coffee for centuries, and I'd say it's a safe bet that Starbucks will still be a leading player in the industry well into the next decade.That's not to say that the beverage titan's business will look the same in 2030 as it does today. Most of Starbucks' future growth will likely come from its international segment, after all. Its China segment is especially attractive, given that its latest class of stores is setting customer traffic and profitability records. Executives see that market growing to many times the size of the U.S. over time, and they couldn't be more bullish on their prospects there. ""No western consumer brand is better positioned than Starbucks in China,"" CEO Kevin Johnson recently said to investors.Sure, the chain is facing major challenges in the U.S. market, where customer traffic has stalled. That slowdown has persisted despite management's best efforts to jump-start afternoon traffic over the last year. Starbucks has made the necessary adjustments to recapture its growth momentum in the past, though, and there's no reason to believe it can't do the same thing here. However, even if sluggishness continues in the U.S., there's little danger of this world-class business losing its prime market position in the years ahead.You just don't get more brand valueAnders Bylund (Walt Disney): If there's one brand I'm sure will have legs for the next decade or two (or three, or...), that would be Disney. With great brand power comes...great long-term investor returns, so Walt Disney is an easy answer to this question -- downright obvious, even.It's simple to find a current example of my brand-power adage: Just take a look in Disney's rearview mirror. Over the last 12 years, Disney investors have pocketed a market-beating 266% return:DIS DATA BY YCHARTS.This surge was powered by Disney's unmatched library of family-friendly characters and stories.The Marvel Cinematic Universe played a big part, building up the Avengers franchise out of some lesser-known superhero names. Now, every Marvel movie is a near-guaranteed smash hit with billion-dollar potential at the box office.Lucasfilm's Star Wars saga is an even safer cash machine, since even spinoff titles such as Rogue One: A Star Wars Story can hit that coveted billion-dollar mark globally. And don't forget about eternal hit factory Pixar.Disney's own burnished brand holds the power to break all animation records, with an unheralded film loosely inspired by H.C. Andersen's The Snow Queen. Disney churns out megahits in its sleep, and I see no signs of the bandwagon slowing down.The same old story will keep on playing in 2019 and beyond, with some additional twists. And the pending buyout of Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA) should offer another adrenaline shot in the Marvel/Lucasfilm/Pixar vein.Next year Disney is pulling away from a successful partnership with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to launch its own digital streaming platform around the world. Getting back to that top-shelf brand, the mouse ears alone should let Disney hit the ground running in the streaming video market.And Disney is a master of exploiting and monetizing its brand. From movie tickets to theme park passes, from hotel resorts to themed cruise lines, from Mickey Mouse footwear to Cinderella dolls, there's no corner of the consumer market that Disney can't or won't dominate. This is the largest and most successful licensing vendor in the world, and that's a sustainable business advantage.In a nutshell, that's why I'm more comfortable recommending Disney for the next decade-and-change than any other stock in today's market and my own portfolio -- including Netflix. The Disney brand provides predictable staying power for the very long haul.Don't let the name fool youTyler Crowe (American Tower): ""American Tower"" is a bit of a misnomer for this real estate investment trust. Despite its name including the word ""American,"" the company's business of owning and leasing space on cellular towers to telecommunications companies is international. Of the 149,000 or so towers in its portfolio, more than 108,000 are outside the U.S. And the company expects that number to grow even more, as it plans to close a deal for another 20,000 towers in India in the first half of this year.American Tower's focus on the international market is a smart one because of the shifting needs of telecom companies. As more mature cellular networks (like those in the U.S.) deploy 4G and 5G capability, more equipment is required per unit of area. As these mature networks become denser, telecom companies turn to less conventional places for their equipment, using distributed antenna systems -- think equipment on light poles and rooftops.While American Tower has some distributed antennas in its portfolio, management has elected to invest in less mature telecom markets, where total cellphone use is high but the use of data by cellphones is still low:SOURCE: AMERICAN TOWER INVESTOR PRESENTATION.In countries where 3G and 4G networks are still developing and broadband use is low but growing, there is immense opportunity to grow the business in the coming years. As telecom companies outside the U.S. see the value in renting space on a tower instead of constructing and owning their own towers, American Tower should have an incredibly stable revenue source and growth platform. That should entice any investor looking over a multidecade time horizon.10 stocks we like better than Walt DisneyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Will China Kill Qualcommâ€™s Takeover of NXP Semiconductors?,"Mar 20, 2018 at 11:01PM","President Trump recently blocked Broadcom's (NASDAQ:AVGO) attempted takeover of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) with an executive order, claiming the deal raised questions about national security and the future of 5G technologies. Broadcom is based in Singapore and Qualcomm is an American company. The move lets Qualcomm catch its breath as Broadcom has to back off, but the long-term consequences could hurt Qualcomm. That's because blocking Broadcom's takeover could impact Qualcomm's planned takeover of Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), which can't proceed unless it's approved by China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). Eight of the nine regulatory bodies whose approval is needed have already given the deal antitrust clearance; only China is left.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Following the protectionist ripplesTrump and the CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) previously blocked several attempted takeovers of U.S. companies by Chinese firms, including Canyon Bridge's bid for Lattice Semiconductor, Alibaba-backed Ant Financial's bid for Moneygram, and the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund's bid for Xcerra.President Trump and the CFIUS are seemingly opposed to most foreign takeovers of domestic companies. Therefore, the idea of a Singapore-based chipmaker acquiring one of the top American chipmakers seemed doomed to fail.While its headquarters are in Singapore, most of Broadcom's operations and investors are in the U.S. The company, which was called Avago Technologies until it bought the original Broadcom and assumed its brand in 2016, was in the process of relocating its headquarters to the U.S. when the Qualcomm deal was blocked.The Chinese government is also protectionist when it comes to foreign companies entering its market and cross-border M&A activities. It fined Qualcomm nearly $1 billion in late 2015 over its controversial licensing fees, and forced it to cut those fees for Chinese OEMs.Regulators have also raided the Chinese offices of foreign companies like Microsoft and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz on vague antitrust charges. Foreign companies that form joint ventures with domestic companies generally receive more favorable treatment from regulators than those that don't.However, many of those partnerships required foreign companies to share their technologies with their Chinese peers. Broadcom was notably partnered with Chinese tech companies HBC, Inspur, and StarTimes. Opponents of Broadcom's bid claimed that the chipmaker could eventually share Qualcomm's wireless technologies with those Chinese firms.How the NXP deal could be affectedMeanwhile, MOFCOM is notorious for making slow decisions. It sat on Western Digital's takeover of Hitachi's hard drive unit for over three years before it finally approved the deal -- with some major restrictions on the integration of the two brands.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.MOFCOM also only approved the deal after Western Digital agreed to let state-backed Tsinghua Holdings take a 15% stake in the company. However, Tsinghua eventually dropped the plan after the investment was flagged for a probe by U.S. regulators under President Obama.With President Trump now adopting a more protectionist stance, MOFCOM could turn up the heat on Qualcomm. MOFCOM likely knows that Qualcomm desperately needs to close its buyout of NXP, the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world, to diversify its business away from mobile chips.Therefore, MOFCOM could pressure Qualcomm to let Tsinghua take a stake in the newly combined company, or push Qualcomm toward additional joint ventures with local chipmakers. But if Qualcomm agrees to those terms, it could trigger a probe from U.S. regulators regarding national security and 5G concerns again -- which would delay the merger again.MOFCOM could also simply sit on the deal. None of these potential outcomes would be favorable to Qualcomm, which could become a pawn in Washington and Beijing's protectionist trade games.10 stocks we like better than NXP SemiconductorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Tencent and Walmart Turn up the Heat on Alibaba,"Apr 2, 2018 at 7:05PM","Walmart (NYSE:WMT) recently dropped Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)-linked Alipay in all its stores across western China after inking an exclusive payments partnership with Tencent's (NASDAQOTH:TCEHY) WeChat Pay. This move could deal a blow to Alibaba, which is trying to counter Tencent's aggressive retail expansion.Alipay and WeChat Pay are the two most popular mobile payment platforms in China. AliPay controls 54% of the market, while WeChat Pay controls 40%, according to research firm Analysys. Many retailers accept both types of payments, but Alibaba and Tencent have been trying to score exclusive deals to gain market share.IMAGE SOURCE: WALMART.Alibaba is the largest e-commerce company in China, but Tencent can leverage the strength of WeChat, the top messaging app in China with almost a billion monthly active users, to gain ground. That's why the Walmart deal is significant -- it indicates that major retailers are willing to choose sides in this escalating war.Why Walmart is siding with TencentWalmart currently operates 443 stores across China, including 406 Walmart Supercenters, 18 Hypermarkets, and 19 Sam's Clubs. Walmart's exclusive deal with Tencent doesn't cover eastern China, so its stores in major urban centers like Beijing and Shanghai will probably still accept both Alipay and WeChat Pay. But Walmart still operates plenty of stores in the west.Walmart's alliance with Tencent isn't surprising if you recall its relationship with Tencent and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), Alibaba's biggest e-commerce rival. Walmart and Tencent are both top investors in JD. Last year, Walmart and JD merged their membership systems so shoppers can receive the same discounts and perks at both retailers. They also launched a new logistics system which lets JD fulfill its orders from Walmart's inventories.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.JD merged its customers' shopping history with Tencent's data on WeChat users, and uses that data to make suggestions for purchases and help vendors promote their products. JD and Tencent also co-invested in Vipshop (NYSE:VIPS), which ranks a distant third in the online marketplace market, and Better Life, a Chinese retail conglomerate which owns convenience stores, supermarkets, and department stores.Meanwhile, Alibaba remains a major threat to Walmart with its sprawling online marketplaces (Taobao and Tmall) and rapid fire investments in brick-and-mortar players like Intime Retail, Sanjiang Shopping Club, Lianhua Supermarket, and Easyhome. Therefore, Walmart relies heavily on its partnerships with JD and Tencent to hold Alibaba at bay.Should Alibaba be worried?Walmart likely dropped Alipay in its stores in western China to gauge its shopper response ahead of a nationwide rollout. Walmart has plenty of reasons to help Tencent and JD instead of Alibaba, so it could be eager to dump Alipay across all of its stores.As the 800-pound gorilla in online retail, Alibaba isn't beloved by brick-and-mortar retailers. That's why Alibaba uses big investments in companies like Lianhua, which owns thousands of brick-and-mortar stores, to expand its Alipay ecosystem.However, retailers like Walmart, which don't want to feed Alibaba, will likely find Tencent and JD to be more accommodating partners. Alibaba definitely hasn't won this battle yet. Between 2014 and 2017, Tmall's share of China's B2C (business-to-consumer) market slipped from 55% to 51%, according to Analysys International Enfodesk. During the same period, JD's share soared from 18% to 33% -- thanks to Tencent's support, alliances with other retailers, and the failures of smaller B2C marketplaces.The bottom lineOn its own, Walmart's deal with Tencent isn't surprising, and it isn't a game-changer. But when we view it in the context of Walmart's alliances with Tencent and JD, as well as Tencent's ongoing battle against Alibaba, it makes perfect sense. If other major retailers follow Walmart's lead, Alibaba might need to shore up its defenses.10 stocks we like better than Walmart Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here's Why Ripple Is Soaring Today -- and Why the Gains Won't Last,"Mar 5, 2018 at 11:39AM","Ripple (XRP-USD) has been soaring over the weekend. As of 8:30 a.m. EST on Monday morning, the popular cryptocurrency had gained 18% over the past 24 hours. The move reversed a negative trend, bringing Ripple's XRP coins back to prices not seen since Feb. 25 -- a virtual eternity in the ultra-volatile world of cryptocurrency prices.This time, Ripple's chart is ticking upward on rumors that the dominant Coinbase platform might add support for this digital currency someday soon. Is there any substance behind this idea, and would it even make much of a difference to Ripple's future prospects?Let's have a look.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The rumorCNBC is gearing up for a cryptocurrency-focused airing of Fast Money on Tuesday night. Among the four crypto-industry panelists listed in promos for this show, you'll find Coinbase president Asiff Hirji right beside Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Will these high-ranking crypto gurus have something to announce from this cable news platform, or will they simply do their panel discussion and then go back home to run their respective -- and unrelated -- businesses?Ripple bulls are hoping for the former option, of course. And why not? As it turns out, Coinbase is in the middle of a hiring spree, adding 500 new customer support agents over the next three months including an influx of 90 agents today. It's unclear how many support agents Coinbase employed before this surge, but adding 100 new names per week would be a significant upgrade for pretty much any company.The official story is that Coinbase needs more human resources in order to handle rising transaction volumes and the increasing number of support tickets that comes along with this growth. The related job listing doesn't require any Ripple-related experience, though it also doesn't mention any other specific cryptocurrencies by name. So who knows, right? Maybe the company is stacking the deck with additional support for a surge of incoming Ripple trades.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The likely outcomeThis is not the first time the rumor mill has circulated some version of this story. Ripple support on the Coinbase platform is a recurring dream for this industry, but nothing has happened so far.I do expect that support to materialize at some point. Ripple is, after all, the third-largest cryptocurrency when counting by market cap today. It is the largest digital coin currently not supported by Coinbase, behind bitcoin and Ethereum. Ripple is larger and more heavily traded then Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, and you can already buy both of these smaller cryptocurrencies through Coinbase.But there's no real evidence that the push is happening this week, as the upcoming Fast Money spot might suggest.For one, Coinbase is running plenty of job postings for software engineers with experience in the four currencies the company already offers. There is not a single posting that even name-drops Ripple in passing. The company simply isn't looking for help in this area, at least not in public.There's also no rush to get Coinbase into the Ripple market. Nothing good comes from rushing into new ideas without a real plan, and that's especially true here because Ripple is fundamentally different from all of the four cryptocurrencies Coinbase offers today.This currency was never intended as an investment vehicle or a store of value, unlike bitcoin and Litecoin. Instead, Ripple was designed as a fast and efficient vehicle for international money transfers. It's all about low friction, limited transaction costs, and high efficiency. The XRP coin is really just an internal accounting tool for the bigger idea behind Ripple, which is the RippleNet money-transfer network.What's next for Ripple?So I'm not at all convinced that Ripple is coming to Coinbase this week -- or next month, and maybe not in 2018 at all. There's even a small chance that Coinbase's business model wouldn't really mesh with Ripple's architecture, making them two huge ships passing in the night and never connecting.Real value for this digital currency comes from traditional banks and money transfer systems adopting XRP and RippleNet as their preferred platform for global transfers. On that note, both Western Union  and Moneygram  are giving Ripple transactions the old college try right now. If either or both would take the next step to embrace Ripple as their official payment system, that would be a market-moving event.But this weekend's boost to Ripple prices was based on dreams and hot air. Expect these gains to fade away over time, getting lost in the daily ups and downs of extreme volatility."
"2 Bitcoin Stocks I'd Never Buy, and 1 I'll Consider","Jan 7, 2018 at 8:17AM","For the most part, I consider bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and most stocks that are tied to them as speculative investments, or even as outright gambling. So it shouldn't be a surprise that as a long-term investor, I would stay away from most bitcoin stocks. However, some perfectly good businesses are starting to embrace bitcoin as a complement to their existing business, and some of these could be smart investments.With that in mind, here are two bitcoin stocks you'll never find in my portfolio, and one that I would consider buying.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.If you want to buy bitcoin, just buy the currency itselfTo be perfectly clear, I'm not suggesting that anyone should own bitcoin as a long-term investment. The cryptocurrency market is the Wild West at this stage, and bitcoin could conceivably be worth $1 million, $0, or anything in between, depending on what happens in the next several years.Having said that, buying bitcoin directly on an exchange is certainly a better idea than buying the Bitcoin Investment Trust (NASDAQOTH:GBTC), which essentially pools investor money and buys bitcoin with it. Think of the business model as a ""bitcoin mutual fund.""The problem is that the fund trades for a hefty premium over the value of the bitcoins it owns. As my colleague Jordan Wathen recently wrote, the fund owns roughly 0.092 bitcoins for every share, so the price should theoretically correspond to 0.092 times the current price of a bitcoin.Well, as of this writing, one bitcoin trades for $16,400, which implies that each share of the fund should be worth about $1,509. However, the Bitcoin Investment Trust trades for $2,344 per share, a 56% premium. Why would you willingly pay $2,344 for something that you could buy for $1,500 with just a little extra effort? This is why I say that people who want to own bitcoin are better off simply creating an account at a bitcoin exchange and buying the digital currency itself.From biotech to bitcoinsOn Oct. 4, 2017 (roughly three months ago), struggling biotech company BiOptix changed its name to Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) and decided to switch its investment focus to bitcoin and blockchain-related investments.So far, the company has indeed made a few blockchain-related investments. It purchased a minority stake in Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Coinsquare and acquired a company called Kairos Global Technology, a cryptocurrency mining company whose assets include about 1,200 pieces of mining hardware. It also bought a 52% stake in Tess, Inc., which is developing a payment service for the telecom industry, based on blockchain technology.However, there have been some red flags. Riot generally doesn't disclose some pretty important information in its press releases. For example, it was announced that Coinsquare had received another investment at more than three times the valuation Riot paid, but no additional terms were disclosed, nor did the company say who this investor was. And just recently, it was announced that Riot's CEO sold more than 30,000 shares, pocketing about $869,000 in the process.Simply put, this is a speculative company whose stock price seems to rise and fall along with bitcoin. The company has made certain blockchain-related investments, but too much is unknown at this point, and it's impossible to gauge the value of the operation with any level of accuracy.A valuable partnership could catapult this financial firm higherHere's the type of ""bitcoin stock"" I could potentially get behind. Siebert Financial (NASDAQ:SIEB), which offers discount brokerage services through its subsidiary Muriel Siebert & Co., recently announced that it plans to offer deeply discounted brokerage services through a partnership with Overstock.com. The service will offer $2.99 stock trades ($1.99 for Club O members) and is expected to launch by the end of the first quarter.Just a couple of days later, Overstock's blockchain subsidiary, tZero, announced that it was acquiring a small stake in Seibert, which indicates the possibility that discounted cryptocurrency trading could be offered through the platform as well.To be clear, I'd wait for a little while to get in, as I'm convinced that some of the recent pop was simply due to having the word ""blockchain"" in a press release. However, Siebert is an example of a real and established business that doesn't need bitcoin to survive. Offering stock trades that undercut pretty much every competitor through Overstock's platform could be a major win for this half-century-old firm.The bottom line on bitcoin stocksIf you couldn't tell, my general thought when it comes to bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, or stocks whose businesses are highly or completely dependent on digital currencies is ""stay away."" Having said that, if an otherwise excellent business is embracing the surging popularity in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as an additional revenue generator, like Siebert is, it could be a good investment. Just make sure the business fundamentals justify the price you pay.Bitcoin is overhyped: 10 better buys for you nowWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3 Reasons Starbucks Thinks Its Growth Days Are Far From Over,"Mar 26, 2018 at 8:51PM","Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the stock market's biggest long-term success stories, with shares up 17,000% since its 1992 initial public offering. In just the last five years, annual revenue has improved to $23 billion from $14 billion as its volume of customers served jumped to 100 million per week from 66 million. Yet after an unusually soft holiday season, the coffee giant is at risk of missing management's growth targets for the second straight fiscal year. Notably, customer traffic has stalled in the core U.S. market, especially during the valuable afternoon and evening hours.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Against that backdrop, executives held their annual shareholders' meeting last week, during which they reaffirmed their commitment to boosting sales by between 3% and 5% at existing locations while improving earnings at a 12% pace, or better. Here are the three biggest reasons the company is so optimistic about its future.ChinaStarbucks' China segment was a bright spot in its latest earnings report. Sales jumped 6% there -- three times the expansion pace in the U.S. division -- thanks to a 6% increase in customer traffic. That success adds weight to management's claim that they've ""cracked the code"" on a market that has been challenging for many other Western brands.China's middle class is projected to double to 600 million between this year and 2022. Meanwhile, per-capita coffee consumption has loads of room to expand beyond its current 0.4 toward the 300 cups that Americans drink each year. Statistics like these give Starbucks confidence to predict opening 1,800 stores in the country over the next three years, to pass 5,000 locations by 2021.Experience upgradesThere are currently over 60 million U.S. customers who frequent Starbucks chains each month but aren't members of the retailer's rewards program. Executives see a big opportunity there to strengthen the digital relationship with those coffee fans, starting with allowing them to participate in mobile ordering and payment.The company classifies its Starbucks Reserve program as another big way it can elevate the coffee shopping experience. These premium locations act as a halo to the core business and over time, reserve roasteries will account for as much as 20% of its store portfolio.Food and cold drinksStarbucks' most immediate challenge is improving its growth pace in the core U.S. business, which expanded at just a 2% rate in the past quarter to drag overall growth below management's goal of between 3% and 5%. Executives said cold drinks like its new nitro platform introduction will play a big role in that turnaround, and that's why the company aims to have nitro taps installed in 4,000 stores by the end of this year.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Food sales should help, too, with an expanded lunch menu projected to contribute to doubling annual food revenue by 2021. Food hit an all-time high of 20% of the business in fiscal 2017 and ticked up to another record 21% in the most recent quarter.Investors won't have to wait long to learn whether these initiatives are working. Nitro taps and expanded food menus are rolling out to U.S. stores now, which should help customer traffic begin rising outside of Starbucks' core breakfast hours.Pushing comps back up to 3% or better would be a necessary step for the company to at least match last year's modest growth pace. From there, it's possible Starbucks can begin targeting gains that are closer to the 5% to 7% growth it managed in fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2016.10 stocks we like better than StarbucksWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why U.S. Companies Tend to Struggle in China,"Jan 31, 2018 at 5:12PM","With 1.37 billion people, China is an incredibly alluring market to U.S. companies. But there are more than a few issues that tend to crop up when they actually try to set up shop there. And it's not just information giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that run into trouble -- it's consumer goods players like IMAX (NYSE:IMAX) too.In this Industry Focus: Tech episode, host Dylan Lewis and Motley Fool contributor Danny Vena talk about a few of the biggest hurdles that non-Chinese companies are facing in the Chinese market today.A full transcript follows the video.Something big just happenedI don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip. Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner and his brother, Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner, just revealed two brand new stock recommendations. Together, they've tripled the stock market's return over the last 13 years.* And while timing isn't everything, the history of Tom and David's stock picks shows that it pays to get in early on their ideas.Click here to be among the first people to hear about David and Tom's newest stock recommendations.*Stock Advisor returns as of April 2, 2018This video was recorded on Jan. 26, 2018.Dylan Lewis: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, Jan. 26. We're talking about some of the interesting story lines in China. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I have Fool.com's Danny Vena on Skype. Danny, how's it going?Danny Vena: It's not too bad, Dylan. How are you?Lewis: I'm doing OK. We're both caffeinated, we're both ready to roll. The tour that was just here at Fool HQ has left, so I'm a little bit less self-conscious about any mistakes I may make as we're taping the show, but it's good. And I plug that tour to say, listeners, if you're ever in the area, shoot us a note. We're always happy to have people come in and check out the show, even though I just said it makes me self-conscious. It keeps us on our A-game. That's what I like to think.Vena: It keeps you on your toes.Lewis: Exactly. Danny, today we're going to be talking about China, specifically looking at two different story lines and what each one shows about the dynamics between U.S. companies, the government, and domestic companies in the country. The inspiration for this show came from a couple of articles that you wrote, so it only really made sense to have you on.Vena: I appreciate the opportunity. It's always fun to talk about these investments.Lewis: Listeners, if you would like any of those pieces, just write in and we'll send them along. I think the case for why companies want to be in China is probably pretty clear at this point, but it's worth throwing a couple of data points out there. So, if there's any naysayers who are like, ""Why are they interested in China?"" give me a couple of stats here, Danny.Vena: China has the largest population of any country on Earth, for starters. They have, at last count, an estimated 1.37 billion consumers there. That's a pretty large percentage of the global population that a lot of these companies want to tap into.Lewis: And that's a population that's increasingly coming online, right?Vena: It is. In fact, China has internet users that number, estimates vary, but somewhere between 700 million and 750 million internet users.Lewis: And then, you also have the rising middle class in China. This is a mega-trend that we've seen over the last decade get a lot of press. Basically, you have a huge opportunity here. The problem is, particularly as an American company, you can't just port over your operations like you would for most countries. I think that's especially true if you're in the business of information, and that's really come to light in the last couple of years with some major companies, namely Google and Facebook, trying to get their way in or eventually having to leave due to issues and disagreements with the Chinese government.Vena: That's true. Google was actually in China for a long time, and left the country voluntarily, they say, back in 2010. They cited several reasons for that. One of which was, they said they were no longer willing to censor the results that Chinese consumers saw on Google's internet site. So, when consumers got on there and they would search for things, there were a lot of things related to the Chinese government, the outside world, that China said, ""We don't want searchers to see that."" Another reason was that, while Google was in the country, they said they experienced a sophisticated hack of their servers. And one of the things that was targeted was the email accounts of some human rights activists. Google essentially said that was the last straw, and they ported over their search results to their Hong Kong operation, and that essentially banned them from the country.Lewis: And rather than leave voluntarily, Facebook was actually banned back in 2009.Vena: That's right. In fact, Facebook was actually in the country as well, and it turned out there were some activists in the country that decided to use Facebook as a coordination tool so they could get folks to and from anti-government protests. The government looked poorly on that, and they shut Facebook out. Instagram was similarly shut out of the country back in 2014.Lewis: So, these two major companies have not had a presence in one of the world's largest economies. Some recent comments from some government officials, I think, were kind of coy in that they talked about how, ""As the Chinese government, we're happy to have these businesses up and running in China. Of course, for them to come back, they'd have to be doing it under the right conditions."" Right?Vena: Right. A government official was speaking at the Internet Governance Forum last month, and said that these companies were welcome to come back to China. We'd welcome them with open arms, as long as they abide by Chinese laws and regulations. Which, of course, can be onerous.Lewis: And what exactly are those laws and regulations?Vena: I have a list of them here. Some of them are pretty interesting. First of all, you know how there's a lot of anonymity on the internet? You can create a fake Facebook account; you don't need to use your real name on Twitter. That's not the case in China. In China, you have to sign up with your real name and provide verification of your identity in order to use social media sites. Similarly, with news programs that are on the internet, they're required to have editorial staff that have been pre-approved by government officials. Any time that there's an internet company in the country, they're required to first have their data servers on the ground in China. And in addition to that, they're required to keep all of the information gathered about Chinese citizens, that has to remain in the country, and they have to specifically ask for permission to transmit any of that information out of China. When we're talking about streaming companies -- and streaming is huge, you may recall that late in 2016, Netflix bowed out of its intentions to enter the Chinese market. And one of the reasons they cited was the government regulatory environment.Lewis: What specifically about that is relevant to them, Danny?Vena: Streaming companies are required to have no more than 30% of their content be from foreign sources. Again, the other same requirements, they have to keep the data in the country, a set of items that I just cited. But that's kind of tough for a company like Netflix, where if they're limited to 30% of their content being from foreign sources. That's not going to give them a lot of entry into that market.Lewis: No, especially for a company that's focusing so much on original content, right?Vena: Absolutely. And a couple of other items. The Chinese government has banned the use of VPNs, which is a virtual private network, something that internet users favored for getting around the Great Firewall, which was the things that the Chinese government used, essentially, to keep out foreign content. And finally, the companies in China that accept money from advertisers are required to verify the identity of those advertisers and their business credentials. So, there's a lot going on in China that we don't have to deal with here in the United States.Lewis: Unpacking a lot of that and getting a sense of what these regulations are driving at, I think you clearly have some efforts there to maintain the government's control over what gets said, and what gets in and out of China. But you look at some of these -- that content one in particular seems like kind of a protectionist measure that's doing something to preserve local businesses. But I think one of the very interesting ones -- we've centered so much of this conversation on how regulations have impacted these U.S. firms. The reality is, these regulations have also had a pretty big impact on the digital ad market in China, specifically when you look at that bullet point about companies being required to verify the identity of advertisers. That came from a place where we were in this Wild West era of digital ad spend in China, and there were a lot of unseemly businesses getting really good placement on some paid posts and paid search results.Vena: That's true. In 2016, Baidu, which is the search giant in China, sometimes called the Google of China, got itself into trouble because a 21-year-old student there died after receiving an experimental treatment that he found on Google search. Since then, Chinese officials have updated their advertising requirements, and they're really strict now on anything having to do with medical treatments, with prescriptions, unlicensed hospitals. There were a lot of fake medical groups on there, people who claimed to be support groups for people who were experiencing certain medical conditions when in fact, they were drug companies or even unlicensed experimental treatment companies who were trying to get users to buy their product.Lewis: Earlier, you said ""Google search"" colloquially. I believe the actual search result was on a Baidu search result, correct? That cancer treatment?Vena: Yes, absolutely. I'm sorry, I misspoke there.Lewis: Which is a testament to Baidu's standing in China, given that that's the association you have there. These regulations went beyond just ""We need to reshape how we're looking at this."" There were also some fines that were levied. Not very big ones, but they were all targeted at the really big internet players in China.Vena: That's true, Dylan. The Chinese government has gradually been trying to seize control of the internet. Now, obviously, for a long time, they have already been able to effectively ban most of the content that comes in from foreign countries. What they were trying to do, like you mentioned earlier, the Wild West mentality that was going on on the internet, it was a free-for-all there. And the government decided to clamp down on that. Their regulations are pretty specific, in kind of a broad way. The say they're disallowing the spread of information of violence and terror, false rumors, fake news, pornography and other information that jeopardizes national security, public safety and social order. So, there are some pretty specific things, but then there's also those broad-based ones that they throw in there, so that if they want to, they can go, ""This falls under here, so we're going to get you on that.""Lewis: And you look at these regulations, and I think the expectation when you think of a government that's kind of known for censorship and walling off itself from the world is, these are all control-oriented, that they are to preserve the status quo. But, looking specifically at the medical element here, with that really unfortunate episode with the cancer treatments and some of the other health forum things that you mentioned, some of these regulations are really good for consumers. These are things that needed to happen in order for the digital ad market to take the next step, and for people to be on the hook for what they're pushing people toward, in terms of treatments and in terms of information. There's a responsibility there that all of these platform businesses have.Vena: Right. Honestly, if you look at some of the clampdowns that have been happening in the United States, and the European Union regarding companies like Facebook, and there have been clampdowns there. There's a lot of talk about fake news, they're trying to ban pornography, they're trying to keep terrorists from using them as communication tools. So, a lot of that is the same. But as you mentioned, there's also some protectionist measures there. China is known for favoring their hometown companies when it comes to regulations.Lewis: And we're going to talk about that on the second half of the show. To wrap this part of the conversation, though, I would be surprised to see Facebook in particular in China anytime soon. Actually, news broke earlier this month that Wang-Li Moser, Facebook's liaison to Beijing, just stepped down. This is someone who had been putting in years of work, in addition to Mark Zuckerberg learning to speak the language and making all of these appearances in the country. They had done quite a bit on the policy side to try to work with the Chinese government and find some middle ground that they could eventually enter the country on everyone's terms. Her stepping down, to me, says that's probably not happening anytime soon.Vena: Facebook is having enough trouble as it is in democracies, countries that allow free and open press, free exchange of ideas, anybody can say virtually anything that they want to on social media sites, and they're still having problems with terrorists using the platform to communicate, stories about fake news, issues that have come up recently having to do with the platform being cited as, people spending too much time there tend to be depressed. And if he's dealing with all of that in the rest of the world, I can't imagine how much trouble he would have in a country like China.Lewis: There's a lot on Mark Zuckerberg's plate right now, safe to say. Danny, you hinted at some of the dynamics between foreign companies and maybe entrenched domestic companies getting a little support from the government. We're going to talk about that in the second half the show. That's another really interesting story line in China right now. Danny, big tech trouble in China is fairly well documented. I think it gets a lot of press. You told me, though, about the battle for the big screen in China. This is a story that I was kind of surprised to hear.Vena: I was kind of surprised when I heard it. But if you step back and think about it for a moment, the propensity for the Chinese government to favor companies that originated in China is well documented, so it shouldn't be too much of a surprise if they should favor a hometown favorite. Now, you may have heard of IMAX. IMAX is one of the largest theater companies in the world. They create the giant premium big-screen format that a lot of folks go to movies and see their blockbusters on. IMAX already does business in China. They control about 68% of IMAX China. They spun off their Chinese screen business several years ago, in 2015. China is the second-largest market in the world in terms of box office, behind only the United States. It's also important to note that China has seen significant ticket sales growth over the last few years. Now, there's a company in China called the China Film Digital Giant Screen Company, which, if you were trying to do a really descriptive definition of what IMAX is, it would come out very similar to that.Lewis: That company description almost sounds like a front. It's so vanilla in its description of what the company does that it practically sounds illegitimate. Not to say that it is. It's a very real giant screen company, and they are in the theater business. But, you know what I mean?Vena: Oh, absolutely. That's why I mentioned it. Now, the government gave them a mandate to become the largest premium format brand in the country, and they believe they can overtake IMAX in ticket sales by 2019.Lewis: And you have to imagine that a company that gets a government mandate from a government that is notoriously involved in the commerce in its country is probably going to be well on its path to achieving that.Vena: That's not a bad assumption. And what they're doing to achieve that is pretty interesting. In fact, the chairman's quote was, ""Our top priority is expansion, not profitability.""Lewis: That's kind of taking a page from Jeff Bezos right there.Vena: That sounds pretty familiar, doesn't it? So, this company, the China Film Digital Giant Screen Company, they allow theater owners to keep a larger percentage of the ticket revenue than IMAX does. IMAX has several different ways that they deal with theater owners. Because putting in an IMAX system is a large cash outlay, big amount of capital up front, they will either let the theater owners pay for the system up front, or they have what they call a joint revenue-sharing arrangement, which is, they say, ""We'll front you the theater, we'll put the projection system into your theater, and you can pay us back over time with a percentage of your ticket sales."" This Chinese company charges just a flat fee for installation that's significantly lower than what the theater owner would pay for an IMAX system. But then, you get what you pay for.Lewis: Danny, you follow IMAX quite a bit. Is this something that has you a little bit worried? You talked about how China is the world's second-largest market for the box-office behind only the United States, and they have a fairly major stake in IMAX China. Is this something that concerns you at all as an investor?Vena: I would be foolish not to be concerned about it. So far, someone making a statement like that, in and of itself, is not enough to make me sell my IMAX shares. I am holding my shares. But, that's something that bears watching, because the Chinese government basically can do what it wants. It's their country. And If they wanted to promote this other company ahead of IMAX, if they wanted to tell their consumers that this is the big bad Western devil, it could cause problems. And the people going to see the movies might think twice about going against something that has tacit government approval.Lewis: Yeah. And operationally, it can be a little bit easier to get favorable financing if you are the hometown team, so to speak.Vena: Right. So, I'm not concerned about it yet, but I'm definitely watching it.Lewis: I think this example is worth highlighting because, we think about these super-big multinationals that we read about all the time. This is an instance of a fairly big company, IMAX, in a market that matters quite a bit to them, but not necessarily one where you think that the Chinese government would be heavily involved. This is a story line that really caught me off guard, and kind of a good reminder that the Chinese government can really decide to support any business that they'd like to.Vena: Right. Just to put this into perspective, it's a pretty sizable chunk of IMAX's box office. If you do a comparison, IMAX's domestic box office in its most recent quarter was $80 million in box office. The Greater China box office was $60 million, which was about 27% of the company's box office totals. Even if the state-backed China Film Digital Giant Screen Company was able to make small inroads there, it could definitely cost IMAX in terms of box office.Lewis: That's probably a good thing to wrap on there. Listeners, just keep a heads out for this if you enjoyed this conversation, I'm planning on having Danny back on at some point in the future to talk about some Chinese companies he's been watching. He follows a lot of the tech companies in that space. And that's companies that are based in China and have the benefit of the Chinese government giving them help every now and then. So, look out for that. Anything else before I let you go, Danny?Vena: No. I rib you a lot about the weather in sunny San Diego, and it is supposed to be 70 today, but I thought I would throw you a bone here. The last few mornings, when I've been out walking the dog at about 05:15, the temperature out there's been about 42 degrees. So, it's not always sunny in San Diego.Lewis: You know, we might hit a high of that today. We'll see. [laughs] But, you know what? Whatever, I'm going snowboarding this weekend, so I have that going on for me.Vena: Cool.Lewis: Listeners, that does it for this episode of Industry Focus.

YouTube Could Be a $15 Billion Business This Year,"Feb 18, 2018 at 7:33PM","Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, owns a small video-streaming site known as YouTube. Alphabet's management loves to talk about YouTube, but it only occasionally provides any real details about the massiveness of the platform.The best information we have right now is that YouTube has 1.5 billion monthly users, who stream an average of over 1 hour of video per day. But the random tidbits Alphabet likes to provide about it never get to the heart of what investors really want to know: How much money is it making?R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian thinks YouTube could generate $15 billion this year, as reported by Business Insider. That would amount to well over 10% of Google's total advertising revenue. The thing is, that number might actually be conservative.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES$15 billion is well within reasonWith 1.5 billion monthly users, $15 billion in revenue would equate to just $10 per year in average revenue each. For reference, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reported an average revenue per user of almost $20 last year. Even Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) generated about $6.40 per user on its platform in 2017, when was it overhauling its advertising business.Television broadcasters in America and Western Europe generate $0.23 (in total revenue) per person-hour of viewing. At a rate of an hour per day, that's about $84 per year. Is an hour of television really that much more valuable to advertisers than an hour of YouTube viewing?YouTube has stronger engagement than either Facebook or Twitter. Facebook last reported its users spend an average of 50 minutes a day across Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. Twitter doesn't say how much time its users spend on its app, but most analysts suspect that's because the figure would be embarrassingly low compared to the competition. TV still dominates our time, but consumers are watching less of it as they spend more time with alternatives including YouTube.Considering Google's ad technology and targeting capabilities, it's entirely possibly that YouTube generates revenue somewhere between Twitter and Facebook on a per-user basis. In the long run, YouTube's monetization levels could even grow to levels comparable with television as it attracts more big advertising budgets from television and grows its subscription service.Will Alphabet ever break out YouTube's financials?Baird thinks it's only a matter of time before Alphabet reveals YouTube's financial results in order to give investors a clearer picture of its operations.YouTube's growth has put downward pressure on Google's average ad pricing for several years now. ""The decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in YouTube engagement ads"" has become a common refrain in every Alphabet earnings release. Last quarter, the average cost-per-click on Google properties declined 16% year over year.Google bowed to pressure from investors two and a half years ago when it announced the restructuring that turned it into Alphabet, splitting out Google's operations off from its moonshots. With the size and impact of YouTube, Baird might be right to think Alphabet will split out YouTube. (He also thinks it will split out its cloud computing operations as well.)Breaking out YouTube's results could be beneficial for Alphabet stockholders, as it would clarify just how valuable the property is. And if it's growing as quickly as analysts believe -- UBS's Eric Sheridan thinks it could generate $27 billion in annual revenue by 2020 -- it's worth quite a bit.10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (C shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

There's No Ripple Support Coming to Coinbase,"Mar 6, 2018 at 1:37PM","Ripple (XRP-USD) coins, tied to the XRP ticker, surged 18% higher on Monday. But the gains were built on rumors, and I didn't think they would last. Today, Ripple's (XRP-USD) mini-bubble popped for all the expected reasons, and the cryptocurrency is trading 11% lower again.What's going onMonday's surge rested on speculation that the popular Coinbase exchange would add Ripple to its hand-picked selection of four supported currencies. This is, after all, the largest and most heavily traded currency that isn't on Coinbase's menu yet, so it would make all kinds of sense to add support. So when cryptocurrency enthusiasts found out that the CEO of Ripple will be on a cryptocurrency panel at CNBC's ""Fast Money"" today, right next to Coinbase's chief operating officer, the stage was set for a massive partnership announcement.Well, that was the theory. In practice, there's no such announcement in the works at all. The two blockchain business leaders will just show up on CNBC to discuss their own businesses in whatever larger context the show's hosts want to pursue, and that's all.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Don't just take my word for it.When Coinbase caught wind of the Ripple (XRP-USD) rumors, the company was quick to tweet out a reminder of its process and policy for adding new asset classes:In a nutshell, Coinbase vehemently denies that it has decided to add any new assets to its small catalog of supported cryptocurrencies. If it does, that decision will be announced via a post on the company's blog ""or other official channels.""I suppose the ""other channels"" blurb gives Coinbase some wiggle room to make announcements from a large, public stage such as this cable TV show, but the company sure is trying to convey the sense of a proper process here. Wriggling through that loophole could cause significant damage to Coinbase's street cred, especially so soon after reminding us all exactly what policy the company would be breaking.What Ripple investors should be watching for insteadThere is no Ripple-on-Coinbase announcement coming tonight. Besides, gaining access to Coinbase might be a big deal for smaller digital coins with less liquidity and lower trading volumes. But Ripple is already a giant of this industry without Coinbase, and is more interested in working out partnerships with traditional financial institutions.Money transfer specialist Western Union springs to mind, as does Spanish megabank Banco Santander. Both of these traditionalists are already testing the waters of Ripple-powered international money transfers. That's the kind of news that really should be moving this major cryptocurrency.Feel free to ignore any rumors of Coinbase support for Ripple (XRP-USD) trades. Even if they were true, it wouldn't make much of a difference to Ripple's (XRP-USD) true worth.Bitcoin is overhyped: 10 better buys for you nowWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here's How Starbucks Plans to Conquer China,"Mar 25, 2018 at 3:02PM","Very few American brands have been able to build significant market share in China. Some U.S. restaurant chains including KFC and Pizza Hut have a major presence, while Apple, Microsoft, and Intel have significant market share, but it's a short list.Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has become a major player in China by opening roughly one store each day. The country has grown into the coffee chain's second-largest and fastest-growing market with CEO Kevin Johnson expressing confidence that China will fundamentally change the company.""Our business in China, has emerged as a growth driver that is rapidly moving us beyond our long-standing dependence on our U.S. business for needle-moving growth,"" he said in the chain's first-quarter earnings call. ""Today, we have two powerful, independent but complementary engines driving Starbucks' global growth with a long-term opportunity clearly visible in China.""STARBUCKS HAS OPENED A ROASTERY IN SHANGHAI. IMAGE SOURCE: STARBUCKS.A growth opportunityStarbucks has largely hit a saturation point in the U.S. when it comes to opening new stores. That does not mean it has stopped growing it its home market -- premium will offer added sales opportunities -- but that's a tougher path than adding stores in a country with a fast-growing middle class.""In 2014, China's GDP totaled $11 trillion and many economists expected to exceed $15 trillion by 2021,"" Johnson explained. ""Rapid GDP growth is fueling a massive increase in China's middle class, expected to reach 600 million consumers by 2021, up 100% from three years ago and almost twice the size of the total U.S. population.""Essentially, the CEO sees the ability to scale its current model for the Chinese market by adding locations. He expects that at some point, the chain will have more locations across China than it does in the U.S.""From an investment thesis, we have best in class unit economics, decades of white space to grow in both physical and digital retail, the most trusted brick and mortar brand in the market, and a world-class management team,"" he said.Premium will play a partIn China, Starbucks can capitalize what it has already accomplished in its home market. That means it can roll out its premium Roastery and Reserve brands as it penetrates the country. The coffee chain has already opened a Roastery location in Shanghai, its second after the one in Seattle, and Johnson considers that one of the company's ""crowning"" achievements.""Customers, in some cases, are lined up for hours to enter the Roastery and be taken on an immersive, multi-sensory coffee, food, and tea journey,"" he said.On its very first day of operation, the Shanghai Roastery became the highest grossing Starbucks store in the world, averaging more than double the number of transactions of our highly successful Seattle Roastery and with an average ticket of $29.The chain expects to serve over 1 million customers a year at the Shanghai Roastery.The best is yet to come""Starbucks has cracked the code on China and no western consumer brand is better positioned than Starbucks in China,"" said Johnson. ""You have to experience our business in China for yourself to fully appreciate it, but we are much more than simply a coffee retailer, as our world-leading financial and operating performance attests.""Those are bold statements, but Starbucks has shown that it understands the culture and can succeed in a market that has befuddled many American companies. At some point, the coffee chain will reach a saturation point in China and need to evolve in order to keep sales growing. However, that day is years away, and Starbucks should produce steady growth in its No. 2, eventually No. 1, market for a long time with its current plan."
Why Take-Two Interactive Stock Lost 11.7% in February,"Mar 8, 2018 at 12:49PM","What happenedTake-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) shares lost 11.7% in February, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The stock hit a new all-time high in January and then sold off following the company's announcement that one of its key upcoming releases would be delayed.So whatTake-Two reported first-quarter results on Feb. 7, delivering sales and earnings that topped the average analyst estimates. However, the solid earnings performance arrived following news that the company's marquee 2018 release was once again being pushed back. Red Dead Redemption 2 was originally slated to launch in the fall of 2017; it was later delayed to a spring 2018 window and is now set to launch Oct. 28.IMAGE SOURCE: TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE. Now whatAs long as the latest delay for Red Dead isn't indicative of quality issues with the game, it isn't particularly worrying from an investor standpoint. The possibility that that game's release was postponed due to serious development issues can't be entirely discounted, but Take-Two has a long history of game delays -- and most of the affected titles have gone on to be hits.Take-Two also has another major, currently unannounced, game set to be released before March 31. It's possible that the Red Dead delay will also push that unannounced game's release back, but other than that, the postponement probably isn't a huge deal. The delay might actually keep players focused and spending on Grand Theft Auto V's online mode -- a huge performance driver in recent years and one the company is focused on sustaining. From a broader vantage, Take-Two looks poised to continue benefiting from the growth of digital game downloads and in-game purchases. The company is also ramping up its development pipeline, aiming to release at least one blockbuster game per year, and working to increase its presence in the mobile space, so it appears to have a promising runway for long-term growth."
