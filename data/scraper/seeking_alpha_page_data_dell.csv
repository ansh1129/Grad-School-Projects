Dell Technologies And VMware: Potential Win-Win Solution,Mar. 2.18,"First off, I am not a tax lawyer. The structures here have a lot of potential tax complexities, so the solutions I propose here might be impacted by tax liabilities that override the benefits. That said, I think the benefits are material and work out well for everyone.A Little Background and StructureFor those who haven't read the reports on this site or others, Dell Technologies Class V shares (NYSE:DVMT) were distributed to EMC shareholders when Dell bought it in 2016. EMC owned 81% of VMware (VMW) at the time it was bought by Dell. As a way to partially finance the transaction, Dell gave EMC shareholders these tracking shares representing 65% of the shares of VMW it acquired in the transaction, representing 53% of VMW shares at the time. These DVMT shares are publicly traded and have traded at around a 35% discount to the 19% of VMW shares that remained publicly traded. Michael Dell and his partners who control Dell own the rest of the DVMT shares.There have been several transactions between VMware and Dell including buybacks, so the shareholdings now stand at:18% of VMW publicly traded82% of VMW owned by Dell Technologies split by:32% owned by Michael Dell and Co50% owned by DVMT holdersIt should be noted that there are other businesses within Dell Technologies. There is the legacy Dell computer hardware and services business. There is also the legacy EMC business and a 77% stake in a software company growing like a weed that handles big data called Pivotal Software that raised money from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and others at a $2.8 billion valuation two years ago (the company was initially seeded by EMC and VMware) and speculated to be worth $7 billion now after nice growth. VMW also owns a big piece of Pivotal and the two work together very well. There are a handful of other businesses that Dell has sold over time and a few it still owns but nothing enormous."
Michael Dell Considers His Strategic Options: 100% Upside?,Jan.29.18,"According to Bloomberg Michael Dell is considering his strategic options to boost growth and reduce his debt load. Taking over VMware (NYSE: VMW) would certainly boost growth, but Dell doesn’t have the means right now. A Dell Technologies IPO would indeed deliver him the needed cash and allow him to build down debt. An IPO would also give an exit route to private equity partner Silver Lake Partners.Problem 1: DebtIn 2013, Michael Dell, with the help of Silver Lake Partners, took Dell Technologies private in a $24.9 billion leveraged buyout. On October 12, 2015, Dell announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation (including its 81% participation in VMware). Dell Technologies took on a massive debt load to seal the $67 billion deal. Dell Technologies ended the third quarter with $52.5 billion in total debt. A big part of this debt is front-loaded and becomes due in the coming years.Exhibit 1: Dell Technologies debt distributionPart of Dell Technologies’ debt is linked to LIBOR. Since 2016 LIBOR rose from almost zero to 1.57%. This means Dell Technologies has to pay more interest on its loans linked to LIBOR.Exhibit 2: LIBOROn top of that comes the new tax reform that reduces the tax deductibility of interest payments."
Dell-VMware Reverse Merger: Good News For Dell Shareholders,Jan.30.18,"Friday rumorsOn Friday, rumors emerged Michael Dell was looking for an IPO and a VMware (NYSE:VMW) takeover. The IPO would give him ammunition to take over the remaining part of VMware that Dell Technologies (NYSE:DVMT) doesn’t own yet. This would give Dell Technologies the growth boost it is looking for. And more importantly, it would give Dell Technologies the chance to build down its heavy debt load.The news sent the VMware stock price soaring. It even reached an intraday high of $165! The Friday close was $150, a 9% increase. This complicated things off course for Dell Technologies!Exhibit 1: VMware price chartMonday rumorsOn Monday, CNBC reported that one of the strategic options Dell Technologies is considering is a reverse merger with VMware. In this scenario, Dell Technologies shareholders would be paid with newly issued VMware stocks. This would solve two of Dell's problems we discussed in our previous article:Reverse-merging Dell Technologies with VMware would give the growth boost it is looking for.The reverse merger would give an exit route for private equity partner Silver Lake Partners.The third problem - the high debt load - would not be solved by the reverse merger. The problem would only become more manageable in the enlarged entity.A realistic idea?1. The market doesn’t like the reverse merger idea. To quote Shaun Nichols of The Register, a leading global online tech publication:If Dell and pals intended to strategically leak this news to gauge sentiment, they have their answer."
Dell Technologies: Too Expensive?,Oct.25.17,"Dell and the EMC M&A DealOver a year has passed since Dell's announcement about joining forces with EMC in a merger deal. To finance the deal, Dell issued secured bonds worth $20 billion (altogether 6 issues with a fixed rate and maturities ranging from 3 till 30 years). This is how Dell Technologies (NYSE: DVMT) was officially formed in September 2016. This deal has become the largest M&A transaction in the IT sector at a total value of $67 billion. This strategic step was taken to consolidate powers. Dell is one of the largest PC producers in the world using a unique operating model based on the personal client-focused approach. EMC has experience in creating data storage systems. A large chunk of the former EMC business is now used by Dell Technologies in the form of VMware (NYSE:VMW) with its software and visualization services.Dell Technologies’s main strategic focus is cloud products and services. This sector is a growth driver for many companies in the IT industry. The most notable IT vendors in this niche are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), whose revenues are not comparable with Dell’s. The cloud segment is the fastest growing operational area within the company, as you can see in the next part.FinancialsWe are going to start by analysing the company’s revenue structure and other key metrics.The company reports its operations across three main segments:Client Solutions Group (NYSE:CSG)Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG)VMwareThe first segment derives revenues from the sales of Dell’s branded hardware, software, security, and other support services. ISG’s revenues come from data center infrastructure and business services. VMware is Dell’s comparatively new business and includes virtualization software and cloud infrastructure solutions (the fastest growing market segments, as was mentioned above). In fiscal 2018, on the basis of VMware’s and Amazon Web Services’s (AWS) cooperation, Dell Technologies is going to provide its clients with private, public, and hybrid cloud environments. This segment includes vCloud Air Network, a global cloud ecosystem, with over 4,300 cloud providers like IBM."
"VMware investor calls potential Dell merger a ""terrible deal""","Mar. 12, 2018 9:36 AM ET","VMware (VMW) shareholder Jericho Capital sends a letter to the company calling the potential reverse merger with Dell (DVMT +0.1%) a “terrible deal.”Jericho holds about a 1.8% stake, which puts it among the top 15 VMware shareholders.Key quote from Jericho managing member Josh Resnick: “Even the most casual observer can see that VMW gains nothing by saddling the company’s faster growth, net cash, highly strategic software business with the dead weight of Dell’s slower growth, heavily debt-laden, legacy hardware-dependent entity.”Resnick says VMware would be better off pursuing deals with other companies and lists potential acquisition targets including Red Hat (RHT +0.1%), Palo Alto Networks (PANW +0.3%), and Splunk (SPLK).

A Look At Dell's Incentives,Jan.31.18,"Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that Dell is considering “strategic alternatives” including an IPO or buyout of the remainder of VMWare (VMW). This sent the spread between VMWare (VMW) and Dell’s VMWare tracking stock (DVMT) to all time highs.Source: Author; data From Google Finance.The current spread stands at 80% versus an average of 44% and median of 46% (Source: Author)In poker there’s an old adage that goes “play the man not the cards.” This is how I am thinking about Dell’s VMWare tracking stock.BackgroundIn 2013 Michael Dell, the founder of Dell, took Dell private in a $25 billion leveraged buy-out. In 2015 Dell bought EMC for $67 billion in a leveraged buyout. EMC’s buyout was the largest pure technology deal in history and Dell relied heavily on debt financing to pull it off.In order to shave some cash off the purchase price, Dell offered EMC shareholders cash plus 0.11 shares of a tracking stock (DVMT) for some of EMC’s VMWare position. EMC owned 81% of VMWare, which was part of Dell’s strategy in acquiring EMC.This structure allowed Dell to shave $17.5 billion off the purchase price and retain a majority voting interest in VMWare (source: New York Times)Tracking StockAs of 11/3/17 (VMWare’s last 10-Q) there were 403 million basic shares of VMWare outstanding (class A and B).Dell owns 331 million of these: 31 million class A (1 vote per share) and 300 million class B (10 votes per share). This entitles Dell to 81.9% of VMWare’s economics and 97.6% of VMWare’s voting power."
VMware 16%-32% And Dell 21%-38% Upside If Dell Proposes A Deal For Starters,Mar.19.18,"VMware Inc. (VMW) and Dell Technologies Inc. (DVMT) have taken a recent beating from overly pessimistic M&A concerns as privately held Dell looks to make a move to shore up its earnings and cash flows after last year's tax reforms. Dell has many options it can entertain, including a reverse merger option with VMware taking Dell public again, along with a host of other possibilities involving VMware, its tracking stock DVMT, along with potential spinoffs of other parts of its businesses, or even the creation of yet another tracking stock etc. After Dell's EMC deal, which seemed anything but lucrative for EMC owners at the time, and the complexities of the upcoming potential deal, I think much of the market is taking a pass at this time on great potential upside for both VMware as well as DVMT whether a deal is announced or Dell chooses to wait until the end of the year to act.According to Dell's most recent earnings report, it was carrying a hefty nearly $50 billion dollar core debt load after it closed the EMC deal last year that has come down since then to just under $40 billion excluding Dell's Financial Service's debt, which Dell does not include in its core debt numbers. This debt has become more of a concern for the company after the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was passed by Congress late last year. This bill limits the tax deductibility of interest payments to 30 percent of a company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ((EBITDA)). So, this means Dell gets to deduct less of its massive interest expenses going forward that it would have before the Jobs Act, and needs to consider possible options to grow its earnings and cash flows, or delever its balance sheet, if it wants to maintain its investment grade credit rating while continuing to pursue further deals. Thus, Dell is looking at merger options involving VMware's tremendous growth and cash flows early on in 2018 instead of waiting to merge or explore other VMware options at the end of the year.VMW data by YChartsVMW data by YChartsDVMT data by YCharts"

Buy The VMware Tracker Trading At A 43% Discount Before Dell Announces The Merger,Feb. 1.18,"Dell Technologies Inc. – Long Class V Common StockCompany OverviewDell Technologies, Inc. (“Denali” or “the Company”) was created with the buyout of Dell Inc. (“Dell”) in 2013 by the founder Michael Dell and the private equity firm Silver Lake Partners. In 2016, Denali bought EMC Corp. (“EMC” and together with Dell they make up “the DHI Group”) and part of the consideration given to EMC shareholders, in order to reduce the leverage needed, was a tracking stock (“DVMT”, “Class V Group” or “the Tracker”) representing EMC’s 81% stake in VMware (""VMW""), which Denali would now own.DVMT has no ownership interest in any other Denali assets including Dell or EMC (except in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy or liquidation whereupon they would split any remaining assets according to a formula). Likewise, Michael Dell and Silver Lake only benefit from the assets of the DHI Group and the 39% of the DVMT shares that the DHI Group owns. In total, there are 331mm VMW shares in the Class V Group and 326mm DVMT shares outstanding, (61%, or 199mm, of which are publicly held) resulting in a ratio of 1.01 VMW shares represented by each DVMT share.Denali through EMC is in the business of providing enterprise storage systems, software, networks, services and cloud computing solutions and through Dell offers consumer and business PCs, consumer peripherals, servers, networking, storage, software, consulting, technical support and cybersecurity. VMW provides software solutions to more efficiently manage computing assets and functions through virtualization as well as consulting, training and technical support."

VMware: Don't Hold Your Breath For A Huge Premium,Jan.29.18,"Investors have huge enthusiasm for mega-deals. And since the IPO of Snap (NYSE: SNAP) or the acquisition of LinkedIn by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), we haven't really had a market-shaking event in the technology space for quite some time. Little deals, sure, but not the kind that plasters every headline for days and prompts multiple analyses from multiple angles (kind of like how Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) HQ2 search seems to eat up every news channel now).Enter Dell. The company has entered into the limelight again, captivating bankers' and investors' attention with the possibility of a huge IPO and/or the completion of its acquisition of VMware (NASDAQ: VMW), the Palo Alto software stock best known as the pioneer of virtualization software.Dell has been a constant source of mega-deal activity, never going more than a few years without having something interesting to announce. Michael Dell, its billionaire founder, joined forces with Silver Lake to take the company private in 2013 for $25 billion. In 2016, the company splurged $67 billion to buy EMC (and along with it, EMC's majority stake in VMware), taking on a load of debt with it. As of the company's last earnings release, Dell has about $52 billion worth of debt on its balance sheet (despite being private, Dell continues to provide public earnings releases)."
VMware: Back Into Buying Territory,Mar. 3.18,"As usual, investors' reaction to deal news is frenetic and almost always exaggerated. Last month, the news that Dell (NASDAQ: DVMT) could possibly be buying out VMware (NASDAQ: VMW) sent the latter's shares racing up quickly over $150. That move was irrational, as Dell was unlikely to pay a huge premium for VMware, 82% of which it already owns.On March 1, however, the exact opposite news hit the wire, with Michael Dell reportedly considering a ""reverse merger"" into VMware that would fully integrate the two companies and give it access to VMware's strong cash flows to pay down its huge >$50 billion debt load. With Trump's tax bill limiting the amount of interest that companies can deduct to 30% of EBITDA, Dell is racing against the clock to wind down its huge debt burden (in the trailing twelve months, Dell has paid a staggering amount of interest: $2.542 billion, putting it in huge danger of losing full tax deductibility on that interest. Its TTM EBITDA was merely $3.852 billion - see my prior analysis here). In addition, VMware has about $7.5 billion of its own net cash on its books ($11.7 billion of cash and $4.2 billion of debt) which would go a long way to starting to unwind the debt Dell incurred to acquire EMC in the first place.As a company that's majority owned by Dell and its controlling shareholder Michael Dell, VMware and its board have little say over what will happen. But as usual, investors' knee-jerk reaction to the deal is probably overwrought, and shares will likely climb back to the $120-$130 range as more of the deal details surface.VMW data by YCharts"

VMware: Trying To Make Sense Of A Rather Complex Situation,Mar.19.18,"VMWare: Trying to make sense out of a lot of moving partsThe stock market continues to track upward, erasing most or all of the losses seen in February’s correction. Last week’s employment report was considered by some as a return to so-called “goldilocks” conditions based on growth and employment, but modest growth in hourly wages. The trade war fright of prior weeks, while still a concern, seems to have vanished into the mists of policies that are far less of a problem than initially thought. And the ultimate impact of tax reform legislation continues to add to growth in many ways. Why all this material about macro economic issues in an article relating to VMware (VMW)?From my perspective, many of my portfolio holdings have shot up and are perhaps ahead of themselves in terms of valuation. Indeed, most hyper-growth IT investments have appreciated strongly over the past few weeks. I suppose that is not the worst thing in the world for me to see. On the other hand, I have no fondness for identifying names that have moved from their dusty corners to center stage, so to speak.When that happens, I think it is reasonable to believe that there will probably be better times to acquire shares in some of my favorite companies such as Nutanix (NTNX), Alteryx, (AYX) Veeva (VEEV), and Guidewire (GWRE), to name a few. And quite a few others as well. I certainly do not like the companies any less as operating businesses, but they may be somewhat less attractive as investments in the short term. I just think it is reasonable to suggest that IT hyper-growth names - whether I have recommended them or not - will simply not be able to offer investors all that much positive alpha the next few months - perhaps until the next earnings season."

"Dude, You're Not Getting DELL...Or AUTO",Mar.18.13,"(At Least Not At These Prices)Despite differences in scale and profile, two recently announced deals, Dell Inc. (NASDAQ:DELL) and AutoInfo, Inc. (OTC:AUTO), have something in common; they are both bold attempts to transfer value from current shareholders to management-led buyout groups. These are not takeunders in the traditional sense, in that they are not priced at a discount to the market price; however, they are priced well below the target's standalone intrinsic value. Both offers require significant bumps in price in order to avoid massive, voluntary wealth transfers away from current shareholders.The leveraged buyout of DELL was priced at $13.65, which is substantially less than what DELL is worth. Potential bidders such as Blackstone Group LP (NYSE:BX), Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE:HPQ) and Lenovo Group Ltd. were not given an opportunity to bid on DELL at the same time as the buyout group. Concerns of shareholders such as Southeastern Asset Management Inc., T. Rowe Price Group Inc., and Carl Icahn were ignored. The buyout group believes that they can make a multiple of their money by simply leveraging up DELL's balance sheet. But of course DELL could do that on behalf of their own shareholders. They do not need to transfer the equity in order to enrich the equity holders."
The Value Of Dell Using The EBIT Multiple Valuation Method,Mar.14.13,"Let me go through a EBIT multiple valuation method using Dell (NASDAQ:DELL). The free online calculator can be found here.P/E multiples are thrown around a lot when talking about stocks, but there is a much better way to value stocks using multiples -- EBIT multiples. Don't be shocked. Just because I'm a value investor doesn't mean I do not look at multiples. I like to concentrate on value-based metrics such as P/FCF, which is a variation of P/E, and even EV/EBITDA, but the more tools I have and understand how and when to use them only helps me as an investor.Given that most people use multiple valuation methods incorrectly, I will show you how to do it the proper way.How People Perform Multiples ValuationThe All Too Common WayYou may have heard this sort of analysis before:""DELL is trading at a P/E of 10.6x with a forward P/E of 8.7x. Its competitors are trading between 9x and 14x. If DELL corrects its problems, it should trade at similar multiples to its competitors. Therefore, DELL is worth $18.""Problems Doing It This WayRight away, there are some fundamental flaws. I understand the importance of keeping things simple, but not so simple that it affects the whole underlying principle.P/E is a broad metric that can vary greatly depending on adjustments to the income statement, such as:A goodwill charge can reduce earnings drastically, although it doesn't affect the business operationIncome from discontinued operations can inflate P/EEBIT Multiple Valuation Is The Better WayYou start with a normalized revenue estimate, enter a conservative, normal and aggressive operating margin to get the EBIT. Then decide what multiplier you want against EBIT, add cash and subtract debt to get a total equity value.It's simple and doesn't remove everything just for the sake of keeping it simple. What's more, if you are looking at a company with several subsidiaries or operating segments that do vastly different things, you can apply the EBIT method for each segment and then add it up to get a sum-of-parts valuation."
Dell LBO Deal Structure - Like Buying A Rental House With Cashback And No Money Down,Feb. 7.13,"Henry Blodget is pulling on exactly the right thread with respect to why the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) leveraged buyout deal is so amazing for Michael Dell and his private equity partners and why it's not so great for existing shareholders.No matter what you think of Dell's products, growth trend, competitive landscape, etc. - this company prints a LOT of cash. So much cash that it's made over $8 billion in acquisitions AND over $3 billion in repurchases and dividends over the last three years, while maintaining a large $5 billion net cash position (as of the 11/2/2012 10-Q).Why aren't more people actually talking about the deal structure here and what it means for how much actual ""at risk equity"" both MSD and SLP are needing to put up to take the whole company private?Sources and Uses:Uses: It's a $25 billion deal, give or take, after including fees. Let's estimate the company has $3.5 billion of onshore cash and LT investments available to use in the transaction, which counts as a negative use of cash because it can be used to buy shares at the LBO price. That figure is approximated by the company's own recent statements that 25% of its cash flow is generated in the U.S. That leaves $21 billion, give or take.Sources:Let's just take the low end of the $13B-15B reported bank financing, to be conservative ($13B). Then let's add the $2B borrowed from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the form of some kind of note. Ok, that's $15B of total sources before you get to the new/rollover equity required to fund the deal. So the new/rollover equity required is then $6B ($21B minus $15B), of which $3.3B or so is simply a tax-free rollover of Dell's existing shares. That leaves a $2.7B equity ""hole"" to plug from a combination of MSD Capital and SLP (and whatever other co-investors they manage to corral into the deal). It has been reported that SLP will need to kick in anywhere between $1-1.5B for its equity portion of the deal. That looks like a lot of equity to commit, even for a big fund like SLP."
Billionaire Carl Icahn Moving Into Multilevel-Marketing And PCs...After Blockbuster,"Mar. 12, 2013 8:55 AM ET","In the view of many investors, billionaire Carl Icahn has been making some unique and potentially risky moves as of late. From his bold entry into Herbalife (NYSE:HLF), which brought noted investor Bill Ackman's short position to a grinding halt, to his recent interest in the struggling PC business (NASDAQ:DELL), Mr. Icahn has been capturing the spotlight.With an estimated net worth of $14 billion, Icahn is a force to be reckoned with on the street. He earned the reputation of a ""corporate raider"" after his hostile takeover of TWA in 1985.In 2005, Icahn won a proxy fight to add himself and two other members to the board of Blockbuster. Icahn fought CEO Jeff Antioco over ways to return the company to profits. Icahn wanted a reduction in pay for Antioco and also wanted to reinstate late fees on rentals. Antioco wanted to keep Blockbuster independent but Icahn pushed to have it buy out Hollywood Video and then sell the package (Blockbuster and its acquisitions) to a private equity firm. Antioco backed out of the deal to buy Hollywood Video because he was concerned that the package could be viewed as a monopoly by authorities.By 2011, Carl Icahn referring to the Blockbuster deal, said:Blockbuster turned out to be the worst investment I ever made. It failed because of too much debt and changes in the industry.In the past couple of months Icahn has stepped boldly into Herbalife, a multi-level-marketing company that deals in nutritional products, taking a 15% stake in the company's stock. This comes after activist investor Bill Ackman publicly announced a huge short position in the company and called it a pyramid scheme. Ackman added that he expected Herbalife stock to go to zero.Ackman and Icahn went toe to toe on live TV in a name calling session over their respective Herbalife positions."
5 Thoughts On The Berkshire/3G - Heinz Deal,Feb.16.13,"When you combine the most oft discussed investor in the world with the largest takeover of a packaged food company in history, you get a market event ripe for analysis. Below are five of my thoughts on the transaction and potential implications on your portfolio.Leveraging Low VolatilityIn a January 2013 article, Making Buffett's Alpha Your Own, I showed that investors could have replicated the returns of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) over the last twenty years by buying low volatility stocks, as proxied by the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index (NYSEARCA:SPLV), and levering them up consistent with the leverage employed by Berkshire Hathaway. An equity stake in Heinz (HNZ) is consistent with this strategy. In fact, Heinz was the fifteenth largest holding in this index given its low trailing volatility, putting the company in the 97th percentile of the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) based on low volatility. If understanding the Low Volatility Anomaly and use of leverage is the overarching key to Buffett's long-run success, then Seeking Alpha readers can replicate this strategy without having to pay twenty percent takeover premiums like in the Heinz deal.Leveraging Transactions Focus on OperatorsPast episodes of leveraged corporate acquisitions prominently featured financial buyers. I have been long of the opinion that levering up a company with stable cash flows is a homogeneous skill that was not unique to wunderkinds at top private equity firms. After the LBO boom of 2006-2007 fizzled into a host of overlevered and underperforming companies and a scarred financial system, companies do not appear ready to repeat the sins of the recent past. The top three M&A deals of 2013 have had unique features that separate them for pre-crisis LBOs. The Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) deal was in part financed with the repatriation of the company's offshore cash, and founder Michael Dell's total equity contribution is roughly four times larger than that of the largest private equity sponsor Silver Lake. The Virgin Media (NASDAQ:VMED) purchase by Liberty Media's John Malone was a strategic buyer expanding his media empire."
The Best Way To Invest In Technology,Jan.18.13,"My Seeking Alpha fellow commentator Paulo Santos recently published an article showing how there is something wrong with the market. Paulo compared the performance of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and showed that how fundamental analysis would have indicated Amazon to be down and Apple to the up. However, the market keeps doing just the opposite. Lately Apple has had a ~30% correction while Amazon keeps going up, up, and away.It is precisely things such as this that break the hearts of investors and make them swear off the market. Tech stocks, especially, are like that. Often they completely defy reason. I swore off tech stocks after the 2000 crash. However, I do keep a small position in the best tech stock in the market.What do you think is the best large-cap tech stock to invest in the past 5 years? If you answered Apple or Amazon, or other darlings such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) you would have been wrong. It is not even the story stock of the past few years as smartphones swamped the market, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), nor it is that darling of the 1990s, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). It is the ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:TQQQ).ProShares UltraPro QQQ seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to triple (300%) the daily performance of the NASDAQ-100 Index.So, every day, if the Nasdaq-100 (NASDAQ:QQQ) goes up by 1%, this ETF returns 3%. If the former goes down by 1%, the ETF is down -3%. If Nasdaq-100 is flat, the TQQQ ETF is flat. What would happen if an investor were to invest a dollar in this ETF and held it for 30 years? My model shows that Buffett like returns would be the likely result.But first things first. How has this ETF done lately?"
The Kohl's LBO Thesis: Does The Math Add Up?,Feb. 1.13,"Since the talk of the prospective LBO of Dell, Inc. (NASDAQ:DELL) began at the beginning of the year, the lists that I remember so fondly from 2007 (and the few years before) speculating on potential LBO targets are starting to emerge, with analysts and market watchers debating which companies are best suited to go private. Unfortunately, those lists of companies are generally populated by those who (1) have no idea how private equity works, (2) have no idea how the credit markets work and (3) are simply offering up a speculative perspective on companies that appear undervalued based upon conventional market screens. As such, I would not put much credence into these guessing games. One such example that hit the wires yesterday was a research analyst guessing on the attractiveness of Kohl's Corp. (NYSE:KSS) as an LBO candidate. Let's run through the math here and see if a prospective LBO could make sense.What is KSS, and what is the company worth?KSS is a big box, family-oriented department store. The company sells (from the website): apparel, shoes & accessories for women, children and men, plus home products like small electrics, bedding, luggage and more. The company operates 1,146 stores across 49 states, in addition to an online business.Based upon multiple stores visits across four states, here is my opinion on KSS:KSS stores are generally clean and pleasant, with a wide-array of reasonable quality brands offered.KSS has no edge in driving store traffic, in that most of what KSS sells can be purchased online or other stores, at comparable (or even better) prices. KSS is not a discount retailer, and not competing on price.KSS does not sell consumables, another limitation to store traffic.The KSS online business is not high marginal add. There is no reason to go to KSS over Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). While sales (and eroding margin to move inventory) can at times capture share (I ran a check the last several days, and on certain sale items, KSS is more competitive than AMZN), broadly speaking, there is no reason to go to the KSS website as the company doesn't specialize in anything.The bottom line is that KSS is an overall pleasant shopping experience for apparel for families, and if you live near one, you might go there from time to time for clothes and stuff, but over time, it is hard to imagine KSS finding real relevance in the future."
"Microsoft: 3.1% Dividend Yield, Good Upside, Low Risk",Jan.22.13,"After looking into the valuation of Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) and HP (NYSE:HPQ), I'm turning to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). MS has not been the focus of much attention recently, and has pretty much fallen out of favor with a flat stock price over the past 10 years or so:Source : MorningStarMS looks like an old tech stock, set to follow the way of Nokia (NYSE:NOK) or Dell, ""killed"" by Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) innovations (which will probably eventually lose their appeal to consumers) or by the death of the PC (which I don't believe in).But let's keep to the facts and stick to the numbers…Basic FactsMS's sales and free cash flow are still both increasing, with a record FCF last reported at $29B.Source : MorningStarIt's true that Microsoft has been ""wasting"" some of its free cash flow with acquisitions that were just too expensive (recently: $6.2B depreciation on the aQuantive purchase from 2007, Skype bought for $8.5B). It's also been sitting on a massive $52B of net cash - a big -part of which is likely ""trapped"" through foreign subsidiaries. However, MS has also been massively buying its stock back and pays a dividend.These stock repurchases are relutive (add value to the stock) and allow the FCF / share to increase faster than the FCF in absolute value (x2.5 and x2, respectively, over the past ten years).click to enlarge)"
The Cyclical And Secular Risks Of The PC Industry,"Jan. 8, 2013 6:13 PM ET","The PC industry is affected by both cyclical trends and secular shifts. Affects on the PC industry funnels though all sub-sectors of the PC industry, including PC manufacturers like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), semiconductors like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advance Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and hard-drive makers like Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NYSE:WDC). This article will look at the cyclical risks (average 3-4 years PC replacement cycle, product upgrade cycles) and secular risks (mobile smartphones and tablets replacing desktops) of investing in the PC industry, and its affects on the various companies within its sub-sectors.Cyclical versus secularWhat does cyclical and secular mean exactly? Broadly speaking, just remember cyclical means short-term and secular means long-term. Keep in mind that you can have both cyclical and secular trends co-exist within an industry.Cyclical means that the industry's growth will go through peaks and troughs. Each growing or declining phase is short-term, because eventually the other side of the equation will come around. For example, industrial or commodity-related industries are high cyclical industries, because they are heavily tied to overall spurts and slowdowns of the economy. Also, think about durable goods such as automobiles, TVs, and desktops/laptops (versus non-durable goods such as food, health and beauty, cleaning products, etc.). Durable goods are typically cyclical, because they have long replacement life cycles (average lives of cars 8-9 years, TVs 6-7 years, computers 3-4 years). If there was a big spike in demand in a given year (peak), then it would take multiple years of slower growth in-between (trough), before the buyers from year one bought replacement products (peak). Non-durable goods companies, such as Proctor and Gamble (NYSE:PG) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), typically are not cyclical because their products have short-shelf life and require you to make purchases regularly (well, besides commodities where you can have significant seasonal and cyclical spikes)."
Texas Hold ‘Em Tournaments And Value Investing,"Apr. 1, 2013 1:24 PM ET","In most casino games one plays against the house; the house writes the rules, enforces the rules, and ensures that the odds are always stacked in their favor. This activity has a negative expected value, and I would classify it as gambling. Value investing is not gambling. When properly understood and implemented, value investing has a positive expected value. In other words, value investors can find situations where they have an advantage and the odds are stacked in their favor. They may not always win, but they are not gambling.I am playing in a poker tournament this week, so I have been thinking about the overlap of my job as a value investor with my strategy as a poker player. Poker, unlike most casino games, is played against other individuals, not the house. So in poker, it's possible to be an advantage player and have a positive expected value.TellsPracticing one's poker face can start youngLike many people, my education on the topic of poker tells started with the great Caro's Book of Poker Tells: The Psychology and Body Language of Poker which teaches you how to read your opponent in order to get an edge. Does anything like that exist in the investing world? Yes it does. Tactical behavior assessment services are used by certain investors to detect whether corporate executives are exaggerating accomplishments, avoiding discussing a topic, or are flat out lying.People are not naturally good at lying. Holding the truth and a lie in one's head at the same time is difficult, uncomfortable, and causes cognitive dissonance that shows up in both verbal and non-verbal signs. There is scientific evidence regarding how to observe and how to exacerbate these signals. In both poker and investing, it can be lucrative to know how to detect deception.Math""If you think the math isn't important, you don't know the right math.""- Chris ""Jesus"" Ferguson, 2000 World Series of Poker championPoker and investing are both about decisions amidst risk and uncertainty, played out in real time. The core of both poker and investing is the maximization of average profit based upon probability. In both activities, intuition is a dangerous guide. Quantitative reasoning, instead, is key to exploiting counterparties. Both rely on the branch of economics known as utility theory. Utility theorists quantify preference orders such that a utility maximizer can determine how to make rational decisions. Making the most money requires that participants maximize the expected value (NYSE:EV) of decisions. To the end of maximizing EV, we use probability distributions in which we study and quantify all possible outcomes as well as their probabilities. The EV of a probability distribution is based upon the numerical value of every possible outcome.What is my takeaway from poker math? My major concern is this: if I could see everyone's cards, what would I do? I judge myself based upon my proximity to that behavior. There will still be losses and there certainly will always be bad cards. Who cares? The key is to have one's decisions approximate expectancy maximization as closely as possible. One should aim for perfect optimization minus only unavoidable constraints. For the investor, the analogous question is this: if you had perfect information, what would you do? Stocks will go up and down and subsequent events will hurt business, but what should your decision be today, assuming perfect information? Make those decisions, as best as you can with the information available.If you want to read more about poker math, I would start with The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic. For further reading two other superb poker books are The Mathematics of Poker and The Theory of Poker.ScaleLiquidity-constrained counterparties make the best opponents. It is much easier to play an advantaged game with more chips. The Professor, the Banker, and the Suicide King: Inside the Richest Poker Game of All Time is a wonderful book about Andy Beal's triumphs at the poker table. Beal is a good poker player, but not one of the greats by professional standards. That being said, he could play a winning game of poker simply by being rich enough, and willing enough to gamble that he threw everyone else off of their games. He turned -EV to +EV by playing well enough with a very strong stack.In the financial markets, large investors have specific advantages based on their size, access, trading cost, timing, etc. Outside passive minority investors (OPMIs) often lose because larger players or insiders can influence a situation. DELL and AUTO are examples of buyouts where management and private equity firms receive a much better deal than outside passive minority shareholders.What does this teach me about investing? It tells me that I always want more liquidity than my counterparties in the capital markets. I always want relatively larger, influential stakes in the companies in which we invest. I look at the ideas that we are considering and, even before picking individual ones for the portfolio, ask myself if we are taking every advantage. Specifically, within the individual security, are we able to position ourselves relative to scale, concentration and liquidity to have an advantage. Anyone who shows up for a fair fight is unprepared, and we never show up unless we have an advantage.PeopleUnsurprisingly, given these overlaps, many of today's top investors are also serious poker players; (the list includes Cliff Asness, Ken Griffin, Jim Simons, Boaz Weinstein, who once won a Maserati playing poker, Steve Cohen, who once quit his job so that he could focus on poker, Peter Muller, David Einhorn, Marc Lasry and of course Andy Beal). Carl Icahn got his start by winning $4,000 playing poker in the army.Disclosure: I am long DELL, AUTO."

Over-Diversification? Concentrated Holdings Yield Better Results,"Apr. 4, 2013 6:15 AM ET","It's easier to invest $100,000 than it is $100 million. As hedge funds grow, the inherent hurdle they most often encounter is capacity. The larger the fund, the more difficult it becomes to capture the inefficiencies in the market for additional limited partners. It comes down to the semi-exaggerated phrase, ""how can you beat the market, when you are the market."" Nimbleness is a virtue of investment management. The easiest analogy is one of nautical term. A 22-foot ski boat can go from full speed in one direction and complete a 180 degree maneuver in a matter of seconds. A crash stop maneuver (from 'full ahead' to 'full reverse') on a fully-loaded supertanker can take almost two miles over a 14 minutes period. Its turning diameter alone is almost 1.2 miles. Ideally, one would rather be in the investment equivalent of a ski-boat.The same can be said for mutual funds. Popular funds become victims of their own success. Large amounts of capital leads to over-diversification. If you have 20 great ideas, but $780 million to invest, you are either pushed into very large cap names, or large percentage holdings. What truly happens is that you invest a portion of your funds into your best ideas, and then surround those with second-, third-, or even fourth-tier ideas, but in lessor quantity. In the end, those funds end up owning the market and replicating their benchmarks. Each mutual fund prospectus highlights its top 10 holdings, but you must search for total number of holdings.Look at Fidelity (I use them not because they are different than anyone else, but rather, I had their data handy). The median number of holdings in their actively managed funds is 195 positions. Position sizes range from 1,132 holdings in a $2.5 billion fund to 51 positions in their focused fund. Even the ""Blue Chip"" funds have over 300 names. You can find a list of holdings here. Although a fair portion of assets are invested in the top 10-20 holdings, the typical fund's average position size is often less than $1 million per name. There are as many as 100 names that each represent less than 1/2% of the fund holdings, and in aggregate represent 29% of assets."
Hewlett-Packard Company: Ratio Analysis,Mar. 4.13,"I have been investigating some large cap tech stocks and I am going to discuss those that offer a good return on investment for a value investor. My analysis here is based on the ratios in the financial statements of the Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) over the last 5 years.The HP earnings report came out less than two weeks ago in what was a big week for large cap tech earnings releases with an earnings report announcement from Dell Inc. (NASDAQ:DELL) as well.These are the two long time darlings of the PC business and they went at it for as long as 12 years. Sadly, they both caught up late to the wave of the future - tablets and smart phones. And this has affected bottom lines. Nonetheless, HP has won the battle for now with Meg Whitman coming out on top during the earnings call as opposed to the lackluster performance by Dell management during their earnings call.The truth was that Whitman had the numbers to back her up as opposed to the declining revenues (down 8% year over year) and 19% drop in non-GAAP earnings over the year that Dell had. For HP, its revenues of $28.4B and diluted per share earnings of $0.82 (non-GAAP) beat analyst expectations and HP stock soared 12%.Price Action:Source: DailyFinanceHP stock is on a rebound now after it underperformed the S&P 500 in 2012; as you can see from the chart above it is well over the 100-day MA (moving average) of $15ish. The stock was hovering at a 9-year low after Whitman's speech at the firm's analyst day in October. The stock price declined from $17.13 to $15.94 and at this point I rightly picked it as a bargain stock despite the fact that HP has been on a long-term down trend.Ratios:Price RatiosYearBook ValueGrowthTangible Book ValueGrowthP/BP/E2012 Q4$11.950.25%-$6.118.67%1.39N/A2012 Q3$11.61-28.47%-$6.69-1.36%1.06N/A2012 Q2$16.23-23.04%-$6.6016.98%0.967.672012 Q1$21.095.71%-$7.955.92%1.278.292011$19.955.17%-$8.45-351.87%1.318.022010$18.977.05%-$1.87-206.56%2.4111.582009$17.727.79%-$0.61-6000%3.0516.702008$16.446.93%-$0.0199.5%2.3211.33"
Why Document Security Systems Is My Favorite Speculative Play For 2013,Apr.28.13,"One of my favorite speculative plays for 2013 is Document Security Systems (NYSEMKT:DSS). The year 2013 could be a massive year for DSS and this article will outline why I have been a buyer recently and why I will be adding on any dips.DSS engages in the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of paper and plastic products to protect information from unauthorized scanning, copying and digital imaging in the United States and internationally. The DSS Printing Group segment produces printed materials, such as security paper, vital records, prescription paper, birth certificates, receipts, manuals, identification materials, entertainment tickets, coupons, parts tracking forms, brochures, direct mailing pieces, catalogs, business cards. Its Plastics Group segment manufactures laminated and surface printed cards, including magnetic stripes, bar codes, holograms, signature panels, invisible ink, micro fine printing, guilloche patterns, biometric, radio frequency identification, and watermarks for printed plastic documents.The FutureOn March 15th 2013, DSS announced that its merger with Lexington Technology Group (LTG) is on pace to close Spring 2013. This is right around the corner and presents big potential for the company moving forward. If the company manages this merger, which I believe it will, LTG can bring a strong and proven intellectual property management team and IP investment portfolio that it will focus on monetizing.LTG has two major investments.Bascom research, which pertains to social network data structure, includes six patents and four applications in this field.Virtual agility, which pertains to user configurable platforms used to create sophisticated, integrated applications and includes five patents and five applications in this field.The management team after the merger will consist of a highly-renowned team full of previous successes. Jeff Ronaldi (current CEO of LTG) will serve as the new CEO after the merger. He has over 25 years of experience in company formation and management. He managed Juridica's investment in patent portfolios, whose investment results include a $50 million judgment. Ronaldi was also a former general manager at ImageExpo, which won a $60 million verdict against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and a $10 million verdict against Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS)."
Spectrum Pharmaceuticals: Here's One Acquisition Rumor That I Wouldn't Mind Chasing,Feb. 5.13,"Any chance I get, I discourage investors from chasing the dream of large gains due to a buyout. These almost never work as planned, and after the initial pop it can take weeks, months, even years for an acquisition to be announced. This is typically an emotional investment on behalf of retail investors, a topic that I have discussed in great detail, and one that is not based on fundamentals. Yet one company that might be entertaining acquisition talks is Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:SPPI), and it might be worth owning.The rumor of an acquisition often creates a great deal of movement. Last Wednesday, Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) CEO Aubrey McClendon announced his retirement and the stock rose over 6%. This is a man who built the largest collection of energy assets in the U.S., yet the prospects of a potential acquisition were far greater than any fundamental loss that could occur. In the last three weeks I have also covered the rumors surrounding both Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) and Zillow (NASDAQ:Z), telling investors how to play the speculation. Because far too often, investors play these rumors wrong, and then lose money when the acquisition does not occur, or when the buy price is less than expectations.While I don't like the idea of buying a stock on the expectations of an acquisition, there is one case in which I think it makes perfect sense, with Spectrum Pharmaceuticals. In my opinion, there are three reasons that make this position attractive: 1) The stock looks to be trending higher and is not accounting for the likelihood of an acquisition, 2) the stock is fundamentally cheap, and 3) the stock is nowhere near its potential buyout price. Before exploring these three reasons, let's look at what sparked the conversation.Acquisition Rumors Starting to BuildOn Tuesday January 29, a report from MSN Money entitled, ""Inside Wall Street: Is Big Pharma eyeing Spectrum?"" was released and the stock rose from $11.55 to over $12.50, before closing at $12.14. The stock made this jump with over one million shares traded in a period of just 12 minutes. These gains, although significant, are nothing compared to the gains that we often see in biotechnology when acquisition rumors begin to spread."
Building A Magic Formula Dividend Portfolio,"Feb. 25, 2013 5:51 PM ET","With low interest rates in the bond market, many investors are embracing credit risk in the junk bond market or taking on interest rate risk with long-duration bonds.Instead, Joel Greenblatt's Magic Formula can be re-purposed to find attractive stocks that pay dividends. In a prior article, we showed that it could be restricted to picking dividend-paying stocks without detracting from the performance of the Magic Formula. Encouraged by this success, we used this screening method to create a current list of the best dividend stocks to buy in today.This strategy is designed for income investors who are concerned that dividend-yielding stocks are becoming too pricey. It combines a screen for dividend income with Greenblatt's screen for the best stocks trading at the cheapest values.What is the Magic Formula?Joel Greenblatt reported enviable annual 30.8% returns for his ""Magic Formula"" in his book, ""The Little Book that Beats the Market"". Since publishing his book, his strategy has performed well. Though many analysts who have followed the ""Magic Formula"" have not seen 30.8% annual returns, they typically report outperformance from this strategy. His results are particularly interesting because his picks are not subjective: they are based on a simple ranking of earnings yield (EBIT/EV) and return on capital.Even more interesting, Magic Formula stocks have historically outperformed the market with a total portfolio which is a blend of value and growth with a beta of roughly one. This blended profile of Magic Formula picks lends itself to do-it-yourself investors as a core holding strategy. Moreover, since many of these picks have dividend yields, they can be used to create an income portfolio.Screening for Magic Formula Dividend StocksThe following methods were used to extract appropriate dividend-yielding stocks from Greenblatt's Magic Formula results:Stocks were selected using the Magic Formula methodology. Each of these stocks is one of a top-50 selection with a $50 million, $2 billion, or $10 billion market capitalization minimums."
I Wish I Traded IP Stocks Like Hudson Bay,"Apr. 30, 2013 8:18 AM ET","If you want to invest in intellectual property (IP), I suggest you hawk Hudson Bay Capital Management. It is making a killing in IP. I have set real-time reminders for all of its SEC filings, and I am consistently amazed by its activism in this burgeoning sector. Although it typically invests alongside institutional co-investors in private placements, even common shares graph a remarkable history of double- and triple-digit returns.The IP sector is one of the fastest growing sectors on Wall Street. According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, the market for global IP licensing alone grew over 500% in the past two decades to over $180 billion. And that's just licensing. Corporations spend another $20 billion per year transferring IP assets between themselves, and then they sue each other in billion-dollar patent wars à la Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) v. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Funds like Hudson Bay smell easy money in this smorgasbord of business activity and are inviting themselves to dinner.This article examines the IP sector and the broader knowledge-based economy that has enabled funds like Hudson Bay to earn outsized profits during the past few months. I recount Hudson Bay's recent IP winners -- Vringo (VRNG), Spherix (NASDAQ:SPEX) and Worlds (OTCQB:WDDD) -- and some of its current IP holdings like Marathon Patent Group (MARA).Outrageous Profits in IPNever before has IP been so valuable, and never before have so many world class companies been opening their checkbooks to acquire it. The valuation being placed on IP is approaching, dare I say, obscene levels. I have already written about a company trading around $3 per share with price targets as comical as $18 and $100 per share. Sometimes dreams come true, however: investors watched VirnetX (NYSEMKT:VHC) go from $1 to $40 per share solely on the basis of IP (the company had just 11 employees while topping $2 billion in market capitalization). Likewise, AOL (NYSE:AOL) rallied over 40% when it sold its patents to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)."
"Dell Technologies, The Largest Private Tech Company, Opens Its Books",Apr.28.17,"A remarkable amount of information has emerged in recent weeks about Dell Technologies (NYSE:DVMT), which rightly claims to be the world's largest privately-held technology company. The company was formed by the acquisition last September of EMC, a leading enterprise storage company, by Dell, Inc., a leading PC and server company. And Dell, in turn, was itself was taken private in 2013 in a leveraged buyout by Michael Dell, MSD Partners and Silver Lake Partners.With these transactions, two major tech players may well have passed from the public view afforded through SEC filings, earnings calls and analyst meetings. Yet circumstances arising out of the acquisition require the merged entity to file quarterly and annual results with the SEC, even as a private company. Not only has it issued a significant amount of publicly-traded debt, it is associated with two tracking stocks.Given these circumstances, we can analyze these otherwise private businesses. In recent weeks, Dell Technologies has reported its fourth quarter and full-year results, filed its first 10-K, and held both its year-end earnings conference call and its first analyst meeting as a merged company. Through these events, and the fiscal third quarter earnings report and conference call, the company has shared a significant amount of information about its structure and finances. First we will review the transaction itself as it was announced and ultimately achieved. Then we will review the constituent businesses of Dell Technologies before we conclude with a review of its first full quarter as a merged entity.The TransactionAnnounced October 12th, 2015, Dell's acquisition of EMC was complicated from the start by the need to capitalize EMC's interest in its publicly traded subsidiary, VMware (NYSE:VMW). The deal was structured as follows: Each EMC share was to generate payment of $24.05 in cash and 0.111 shares of a newly created tracking stock. As part of the financing of the transaction, Dell parent Denali Holding, Inc. issued $23.250 billion in senior notes, partially funding the mezzanine needed to conclude the deal. A new class of shares (Class V) was created for the tracking stock, which was intended to track the performance of VMware. Class V shares correspond on a one-for-one basis to EMC's shares in VMware."

[Operator Instructions]I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin.Rob WilliamsThanks, Regina. Good morning and thanks for joining us. With me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Sweet; our President of Infrastructure Solutions Group, David Goulden; and joining us from Europe is our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson.On this call, we will focus primarily on Q4 results. We will provide more details on our strategy, integration efforts and capital structure at our Investor Meeting on April 5. For more details, please see the Events section of our Web-site at investors.delltechnologies.com.We posted our fourth quarter press release and Web-deck on our Web-site and Q4 results will be filed on Form 10-K tomorrow. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective. In addition, fiscal 2017 had an extra week, which was incorporated into the Company's Q4 resultsNow I would like to highlight key changes to our financial statements due to the EMC merger and the announced divestitures. As mentioned last quarter, we are reporting EMC and VMware on the Dell Technologies fiscal year. VMware Inc. has now transitioned and will report their standalone financial results on the basis of Dell Technologies fiscal year, which started on February 4, 2017 and will end on February 2, 2018. Operationally, this transition will help align our combined financial goals and go-to-market approach.Due to the recent divestitures of Dell Services, Dell Software Group and the Dell EMC Enterprise Content Division, these businesses were reported as discontinued operations in Q4 results. In prior quarters, all assets and liabilities of these businesses were reclassified into the held-for-sale asset and liability categories on the balance sheet. On the income statement, the financial results of these businesses were reclassified out of the activity from continuing operations and listed separately in the category for discontinued operations. For more information, please refer to our SEC filings.Our Q4 non-GAAP operating income excludes approximately $3.5 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are non-cash and relate to purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. Please note that due to the EMC merger and to a lesser extent the Dell go-private transaction, there will continue to be significant bridging items between our GAAP and our non-GAAP results for the next few years, although the impact will decline in each subsequent quarter. Please refer to Slide 3 in the Web-deck for additional detail on the non-cash adjustments and the supplemental slides beginning on Slide 17, as well as our SEC filings for more details on our non-GAAP adjustments."

The Behavior Of Stock Market Manias,"Mar. 23, 2017 3:36 AM ET","I've heard more and more commentary/concern about the level of the overall market lately. With the market relentlessly marching to new all-time highs just about every day, I've even begun to hear the word ""bubble"" being used. While I certainly don't think the market overall is cheap, and while I certainly believe it's very possible that a bear market could occur at any time, we are definitely not in a bubble. Anyone who thinks that the current market is reaching levels that would correspond to previous manias should study previous manias. The late 1990s saw unbridled enthusiasm among individual investors, reckless behavior by corporate managers, and significant complicity by lawmakers and regulators.Even though the late 90's bubble wasn't that long ago, I think it's easy to forget how crazy some of the valuations were and how egregious some of the behavior was among market participants and management teams.I recently read the book Bull by Maggie Mahar, and I thought I'd highlight just one example that illustrates the speculative fervor that existed at the time.One of the perks about being CEO of a publicly traded company of the 1990's was that you could pay yourself with huge amounts of stock options, but yet not count those stock options as an expense on your company's financial statements. It was creating money out of thin air. You, as public company CEO (along with other top executives) could mint multi-million dollar pay packages each year that seemingly had no strings attached (because it wasn't an expense as far as the income statement was concerned). This was obviously a complete fallacy. The options were an expense - a significant one. Doling out millions of stock options to yourself and your friends might not have shown up in that year's income statement, but it did show up in the shareholder's equity statement in the form of increasing the overall amount of shares outstanding. Obviously, more shares outstanding means lower earnings per share for all other shareholders. Even without counting the options as an expense, the pie was the same size and each shareholder's slice was now smaller."
The Motorcycle's Place In Globalization,"Mar. 7, 2017 12:38 PM ET","Financial, regulatory, and economic issues all dynamically relate. Sometimes the flows of information can have different implications: for example, discussion on globalization does not tend to cite poor financial advice that pours across online borders, or the struggles of companies such as Dell computers that have outsourced Indian call centers. While there are unfortunate or objectionable issues, several can be peripheral to a hot topic.There is an ongoing matter that few seem to be taking on amid a near-chorus of academics in support of free trade. Talk is of a 100% tariff on European small motorcycles, meaning with engine sizes from 51 to 500cc. If you are not familiar with the actual product, something 50cc is probably a scooter or moped; a highly-fuel efficient means of transport that could be fun to own, and is easy to park, but can be unsafe in all but sunny weather. A 500cc engine goes in a motorcycle for most intents and purposes; it might cost under $100 per year to insure and obtain 50 miles per gallon, although its acceleration could be insufficient if a passenger is aboard.Specific Two-Wheeled VehiclesThe $8,999 Piaggio (OTCPK:PIAGF) MP3 500 Business ABS shown below might not be applicable because it has three wheels, but the $6,399 price of the BV 350 ABS would increase:According to the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA), other affected manufacturers include Aprilia, Beta, BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY), Ducati (OTCPK:AUDVF), Fantic, Gas Gas, Husqvarna, KTM, Montesa, Scorpa, Sherco, TM and Vespa. Scorpa is a French company. Gas Gas is Spanish. Sherco is French and Spanish. Husqvarna is German. Montesa is a Spanish subsidiary of Honda (NYSE:HMC)."
Opportunistic Investing - The Case For Merger Appraisal Rights,"May 26, 2016 9:42 AM ET","By Hedge Fund Solutions GroupThis niche, legally intensive strategy has the potential for providing compelling uncorrelated returns.U.S. mergers and acquisitions activity surged to an all-time high in 2015, with deal volume growing over 50% year-over-year to approximately $2.3 trillion.1 Coinciding with this M&A growth has been an increase in corporate litigation and, in particular, cases in which shareholders have exercised their rights to seek appraisal to challenge the price offered in a buyout. In this article, we discuss appraisal rights in detail and why we believe the strategy represents a compelling investment opportunity.OverviewAppraisal rights exist to ensure that minority shareholders receive fair value for their shares when a company is acquired in a cash deal. While most states have some form of appraisal remedy (the rules vary significantly from state to state), Delaware is the leading statutory example, with more than half of U.S. public companies incorporated in the state.2 Given Delaware's extensive case law on the subject, we will focus our thoughts on appraisal rights as it applies to the Delaware General Corporation Law.Appraisal rights provide shareholders in an acquisition with a legal remedy to petition for an independent determination of fair value as an alternative to accepting the offered deal price. Those seeking appraisal forgo the merger consideration in anticipation that the awarded amount through a judicial determination or settlement will be higher. In order to demand appraisal, shareholders must vote against the transaction (or abstain) and adhere to strict procedural requirements, including several notice provisions. While most cases are settled privately before going to court, those that go to litigation involve discovery along with expert witness reports and rebuttals. A general overview of an appraisal proceeding is provided in Figure 3.1."
"Microsoft And Google Make Peace, And Apple Moves To Improve The Watch's Performance","Apr. 25, 2016 7:07 AM ET","Welcome to the April 25th edition of Seeking Alpha's Eye on Tech newsletter.Eye on Tech CoverageYouTube's Strengths And Weaknesses As It Goes After TV Ad DollarsA WSJ column notes YouTube's ability to grab TV dollars has been limited by factors such as relatively high prices, advertiser concerns about the quality of some YouTube content (they have mixed feelings about cat videos), immature tools for measuring an online video ad's success, and ad agency structures.Nonetheless, YouTube is still often seen as a more appealing venue for video ads than social media platforms, given content quality concerns are even higher on social and video ads can feel intrusive when run against some social content.In spite of its challenges, YouTube video ad growth was a big reason Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) total paid clicks rose 29% Y/Y in Q1, and its paid clicks on Google sites rose 38%.Google's Network Ad Sales Growth Slowdown Draws Attention Following Q1 MissMany post-earnings Google analyst reports noted the company's revenue growth for ads sold on third-party sites fell to just 3% Y/Y in Q1.The loss of Google's AOL search deal weighed, as did Facebook's tremendous ad sales growth.On the other hand, ad sales on Google sites rose 20% Y/Y. Evercore thinks Google's increasing ability to sell search and video ads based on search and browsing history is providing a lift.Noteworthy Tech NewsMicrosoft and Google agree to drop regulatory complaints against each other - The latest sign an era of detente is emerging among tech giants in the legal/political realm. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google had already settled their far-reaching patent dispute in 2015. That occurred a year after Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) settled their patent dispute. Microsoft and Apple have long had a patent cross-licensing deal in place - probably because each could sue the other into oblivion, and only patent lawyers would benefit if they did."
What To Buy In Europe: 4 Stocks For Long-Term Investors,"Apr. 9, 2015 8:22 AM ET","The Euro has plummeted over the last months and now trades at $1.08. The sharp decrease is mainly due to divergent monetary policies between the Fed (potential tightening) and the ECB (low rates and quantitative easing). As the markets expect additional quantitative easings in Europe, the currency could be poised to weaken again.According to Bank of America, the Euro could reach parity by the end of the year.Sources: Business Insider; Bank of America.Considering the recent positive European indicators and that the ECB raised its growth forecasts, the Euro could have been oversold and rally in the short-term. As a consequence, the current exchange rate could be pretty decent in order to acquire some European stocks.Picking stocks for long-term investorsAs a young investor reading B. Graham, W. Buffett or P. Fisher, I have learned to consider the stock market as a huge store where stocks have a value and a price. Both sides are fascinating as they involve business indicators, growth prospects, financial strength, research & development, corporate structure & governance but also more human related psychological factors that can drive the stock price well above or below its intrinsic value.Sometimes, share prices go bananas but some other times, they are on sale and it's a great opportunity but also a great pleasure to buy at a discount."
Tracking Small-Cap Super Investor MSD Capital - Q2 Update,"Aug. 24, 2014 3:45 PM ET","Investors can benefit from tracking the portfolio of not only large and mid-cap super investors, but also small-cap super investors such as MSD Capital. The firm helps Michael Dell diversify his wealth away from his large equity ownership in Dell Computers. While the firm manages somewhere around $12 billion and holds many other alternative assets, the long-only portfolio is extremely concentrated to a few small-cap companies and has always been that way since the earliest filings in 2000. The high concentration should not be any surprise, since Michael Dell understands the power of putting all his eggs into one basket, Dell, and letting a few high quality companies compound the capital for you. We would think that Michael Dell and the managing partners at MSD Capital would agree with Warren Buffett's statement that:I'm a better investor because I am a businessman and a better businessman because I am an investor.A little background on Co-Managing Partners of MSD found at their website:Glen Fuhrman -Mr. Fuhrman is Co-Managing Partner of MSD and Co-Founder of the firm. Prior to forming MSD, he worked from 1988 to 1998 at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he was a Managing Director and Head of the Special Investments Group. While at Goldman, he served on the Investment Committees of Goldman Sachs' Private Equity Partners I, II & III, L.P., a series of multi-manager private equity partnerships aggregating over $3 billion, and on the Boards of Directors of the Stone and Bridge Street Funds, the private investment funds for the partners and employees of Goldman Sachs.John Phelan -Mr. Phelan is Co-Managing Partner of MSD and Co-Founder of the firm. Prior to forming MSD, he was a Principal from 1992 to 1997 at ESL Investments, a Greenwich, Connecticut based investment firm. At ESL, John was responsible for ESL's Special Situation Investments and helped grow the firm from $50 million to over $2.0 billion in assets under management. Prior to ESL, John was Vice President in charge of Acquisitions (Western Region) for the Zell-Merrill Lynch Real Estate Opportunity Funds. John began his career at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he worked from 1986 to 1988 as an Analyst in the Investment Banking Division."
Ruckus Wireless - Taking On Ubiquiti Is A Mistake,Nov. 9.14,"I would avoid Ruckus Wireless (NYSE:RKUS) given industry developments and new product introductions. Ruckus is an industry leader in the growing carrier class Wi-Fi market, a market that is trending toward lower prices and lower margin solutions. I also believe Ruckus is making a mistake by entering the small business home office market now dominated by Ubiquiti Networks, (NASDAQ:UBNT). I doubt their traditional business model can support disruptive pricing, and I am concerned their new products' limited feature set will cheapen their brand, hurt gross margins and cannibalize their existing lower end offerings.The CompanyOn November 3, Ruckus Wireless reported revenue of $85 million and earnings of 13 cents per share for the September quarter. The Sunnyvale, CA company is just 10 years old. Prior to the announcement of Exclaim, it operated in the carrier class/enterprise class Wi-Fi market against Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Aruba (NASDAQ:ARUN); a class that does not include the small office and small home, SOHO, market. The latest wireless WLAN market report from The Dell'Oro group showed Ruckus gaining share and now in a virtual tie with Cisco as leaders in this market with Cisco at 23.7% and Ruckus at 23.6% percent of the market.The company conducts business worldwide and divides revenues into 2 product areas, enterprise and service provider. The enterprise WLANs, wireless local area networks, are large deployments of Wi-Fi for education, hospitality, arena, retail, transportation, office and warehouse environments. The service division concentrates on MSO's or cable/direct satellite television companies. Both segments are growing.

Ruckus Wireless: A Bark Too Loud To Ignore,Oct. 3.14,"Who Are You, Ruckus Wireless?Ruckus Wireless (NYSE:RKUS) is a company that makes Wi-Fi equipment for the enterprise level. The company was founded in 2004 as a startup trying to use its intellectual property to offer value for IPTV (internet-protocol-television) providers.After some tweaking and tuning, the small startup pivoted into a Wi-Fi equipment supplier for enterprises and service providers. Peter Lynch once said that if you can't illustrate an investment idea with crayons and explain it to him in a few minutes, it wasn't worth his time for further investigation.So, this is not exactly crayons, but with the help of the Ruckus marketing department, after the following four minutes, you'll understand the investment idea. Promise.I got to know Ruckus in early 2012, before it even announced plans for an IPO. Back then, a company called ""Alvarion"" was competing in the same market as Ruckus. When I sat with the now-bankrupt Alvarion's CFO, I asked about the competition.After elaborating on the stiff competition they have, he mentioned Ruckus Wireless as a company that then had the far superior technological product in the market, better than even the giant Cisco. A few months later, and Alvarion failed to meaningfully penetrate the Wi-Fi equipment market and declared bankruptcy.Since then, I have eagerly followed Ruckus Wireless to understand who exactly this small private company is, which Alvarion couldn't even get close to competing with.Eventually, Ruckus hit a tipping point and had to go public to support its growth. Having a marketing department like that of Ruckus, which provided a stream of very vocal and fun videos about the company, is a sure recipe for a high-priced IPO.Disappointed, I made myself a note to keep an eye on RKUS and wait for a good entry point."
"Watch Out Apple, Xiaomi Is Coming To Each One Of Your Segments",Nov.17.14,"Chinese tech company Xiaomi is a rising star in the consumer electronics world, considered by many to be the next big thing out of China. In the last few years, many Chinese companies have stepped outside of mainland China and started threatening the world dominance of giant Western companies. A few examples include Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), which threatens Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the search market; Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which threatens Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the eCommerce market and PayPal (NASDAQ:EBAY) in the electronic payments market; Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), which threatens Dell, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the PC business; and the list goes on to almost every sector.In the consumer electronics, specifically the smartphone market, many Chinese companies have tried to threaten Apple's and Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) dominance, but couldn't quite make it. Lenovo, Huawei, ZTE (OTCPK:ZTCOF) and many others offered low-cost smartphones and tablets, but could not push Apple and Samsung from their leadership positions worldwide. Can Xiaomi's effort be more successful than other Chinese attempts? Should Apple and Samsung really be concerned about Xiaomi, or is it just a local phenomenon in China?Xiaomi was founded four years ago by Chinese tech entrepreneur Lei Jun as a smartphone vendor and released its first Android-based firmware named MIUI shortly after. In August 2011, Xiaomi launched its first smartphone, the Mi1, which was nicknamed the Chinese iPhone and received more than 300,000 pre-orders, making it an immediate success for the company. The Mi1's success was driven by its attractive low price, which offered the Chinese middle class the opportunity to own a high-end product at an affordable price. Following the Mi1's success, Xiaomi used the same pricing strategy for its next-generation smartphones and managed to replicate the Mi1's success, increasing the number of phones shipped every quarter."
E-Bikes And Tablets: Two More Bullish Catalysts For Undervalued Battery Maker Highpower Technology,Sep. 4.14,"Highpower Technology (NASDAQ:HPJ) is riding the wave of increased rechargeable battery demand and has posted 40%+ growth for its lithium-ion product line over the last two quarters. In my most recent article on HPJ (Chinese EV Battery Market Just Another Bullish Catalyst For Highpower Technology), I neglected to mention another powerful catalyst for the company going forward: electric bikes (E-bikes).A recent report by Navigant Research forecasts strong growth in the worldwide market for E-bikes. Navigant predicts the large Chinese market was expected to reach 28 million E-bikes in 2013 - 92% of the total world market. Because of its size, Navigant excluded China from the chart below in order to more clearly show the granularity of the other markets.Navigant says the vast majority of E-bikes currently use sealed lead-acid (""SLA"") batteries. But this is changing as Li-ion batteries grow in popularity. This represents a huge opportunity for HPJ. The company can use its new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility to ramp up Li-ion battery sales and expand its E-bike battery market share."
Autodesk: New Business Model On Track To Be A Success,Oct. 8.14,"We have long been positive on Autodesk's (NASDAQ:ADSK) business model transition from licenses to cloud and subscriptions, pointing out that revenue streams would become more recurring and predictable, that new paying users would join thanks to lower upfront costs and that piracy would be reduced through the use of cloud-based authentication. In all, a subscription-based model is likely to deliver higher revenues, margins and cash flows in the long run.The new business model was in focus during Autodesk's Investor Day last week and sparked many sell-side upgrades as Autodesk provided strong metrics giving increased confidence in the transition and in the group's ability to achieve and potentially exceed its long-term guidance. As a reminder, Autodesk expects 12% billings CAGR through FY18 and a 30% operating margin in FY18 (from 15-16% in FY15).Autodesk speeds up the transition: 100% recurring revenues in sightAs commented in our previous articles, the model transition has been performing ahead of expectations in Q1 and Q2, leading Autodesk to raise its FY15 net adds target to 200-250K from 150-200K when reporting its Q2 figures. Interestingly, the company said that 30-35% of subscribers were net new customers, confirming that the ""lower cost"" (see the impact on ARPU below) model was attracting new users.It looks like the transition will now go even faster as Autodesk announced plans to phase out perpetual licenses over the next 12-24 months, starting with AutoCAD LT. Of the company's 2.9m customers that are not on a subscription plan, half of them are AutoCAD LT users and will have to migrate soon."
Get Paid While You Sleep: REITs That Pay Monthly,"Sep. 17, 2014 7:00 AM ET","Over a month ago, I wrote an article compiling a list of REITs that pay monthly dividends. As I have witnessed here on Seeking Alpha, the monthly paying companies have proven to be a most popular theme.It's not hard to see the attraction to a monthly dividend, particularly if you are retired and living off your investments. Your expenses - including everything from house and car payments to your cable bill and cell phone bill - are almost always on a monthly cycle, whereas most income-producing investments pay quarterly or semi-annually.So the advantages of a monthly dividend payment is 1) it makes bill paying easy, 2) it reduces the volatility of the shares when going ""ex-dividend"", because the companies that pay frequently usually communicate more often (than the quarterly payers), and so if the monthly payer increases, reduces, or suspends the dividend, the shareholder can respond faster to the good or bad news, and 3) you just make more money. If you don't rely on the monthly income, you take can take advantage of the power of compounding.The wonder of compounding transforms your investable money into a highly powerful income-generating tool. Compounding is simply the process of generating earnings on an asset's reinvested earnings. To work, it requires two things: the reinvestment of dividends and time. The more time you give your investments, the more you are able to accelerate the income potential of your original investment.By using compounding, your portfolio amplifies the growth of your working money and maximizes the earning potential of your investments - but remember, because time and reinvesting make compounding work, you must keep your hands off the principal and dividends. Marc Litchenfeld, author of Get Rich with Dividends, explains:"
How Big Is EX4600 For Juniper?,Sep.11.14,"Juniper's (NYSE:JNPR) range of Ethernet switches recently welcomed the EX4600 to the family. The switches have been built on the open converged framework of the company and are more flexible. They offer more connectivity solutions in order to support campus environments where the concept of ""Bringing Your Own Devices,"" BYOD, is more common. Before the announcement of this new switch to the portfolio, the company had announced the release of the EX9200 switch in 2013. This indicates that the company has been spending a lot of time in expanding its portfolio of switches.Mike Marcelline, the senior vice president of strategy and marketing at Juniper discussed the support for the new EX4600 switches,""As more and more personal devices are being brought into the campus and enterprises continue to deploy cloud-based business applications, great demands are being put on the campus network to not only support varying devices but also ensure uninterrupted data access to cloud services. To meet these evolving requirements, Juniper has built its new EX4600 switches on the design principles of our new Open Converged Framework for the cloud-enabled campus - an open architecture that embraces third party solutions, provides a virtualized and programmable platform to enable network function convergence with a plug-and-play design that seamlessly scales as campus cloud requirements demand.""Juniper's switching business has been doing remarkably well over the past couple of years and last year its sales grew at a 15% year-on-year growth rate. This growth rate followed into the current year as well and sales in the first quarter grew by a staggering 46%. The year-on-year growth rate reported for the second quarter was 25%. Demand for next generation data center transformations and cloud building projects have spurred the demand for switching technology."
"Citrix Killer: Sphere 3D's Debut On Nasdaq, Merger With Overland, Purchase Of V3 Systems",Jul.21.14,"Sphere 3D Corp.'s (NASDAQ:ANY) debut on the NASDAQ Global Market this week heralds the arrival of a new and powerful competitor to the Information Storage and Virtualization sectors - two of the fastest growing segments of the world economy.The incumbents in the space are Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS) with a $10 billion market cap, EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) with a $54 billion market cap, VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW) with a $41 billion market cap, and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) with a $367 billion market cap.The reason why I think Sphere 3D is a serious contender is as a result of several acquisitions the company has made in the last year, combining Sphere's Glassware 2.0 virtualization platform - by all accounts, a revolutionary approach to virtualization - with V3 Systems' Virtual Desktop products and Overland Storage's global data management and storage business.The target is the $100 billion Virtualization/Storage space, and early indications suggest that Sphere 3D's Glassware 2.0 is already displacing the incumbents in enterprise-scale applications.If you look at the new corporate structure of the combined Sphere 3D Corp., it bears an uncanny resemblance to that of EMC Corp. before it floated 15% of VMware back in 2009, essentially creating two value creation machines where formerly there was one.Is Sphere 3D the nucleus of that successful model? I happen to believe it is, and here's why.Virtualization and Storage Industries: Explosive Growth AheadThere are a few great anecdotes around that capture the real scale and scope of the explosion in information and data generated by business worldwide. Now saddled with the simplistic yet succinct ""Big Data"" tag, that label already appears understated."
Coca Cola: A Company That Is Facing Mixed Future Expectations.,Sep.29.14,"The world's leading soft drink company, Coca Cola (NYSE:KO), has a long history of outstanding performance. However, closer to the present, Coke's revenue growth has considerably decreased due to lower sales of its soft drinks. This resulted in a small gain of 8.7% by Coke's stock during last 12 months, significantly underperforming the S&P which had a 22.5% gain over the same period. The analysis offers both opportunities and risks for the company's future.A Boost In MarketingRecently the management had acknowledged the company's current state and the need for action to improve growth. First of all, Coke announced that it will spend $1 billion on extra marketing efforts by 2016. The impact is already evident. The company's ""Share A Coke"" campaign has considerably helped to boost sales, managing to increase worldwide volume growth by 3% in the latest quarter. The company still had a decline in revenue of 2.6% for the first six months of 2014; however, the gross margin actually showed improvement by 0.6%. The increasing spending on marketing will help Coke to achieve higher growth and revenue levels.Demand For Still Beverages IncreasesThe company was able to sustain an acceptable level of revenue mostly due to its still beverages. In the first quarter of 2014, Coca-Cola's sparkling beverage volume was able to increase by 6% globally. This result is more than three times greater than the company's overall volume growth rate for 2013, and six times better than the sparkling beverage volume growth in 2013. The success in still beverages is driven by two factors; the brand investment and the increasing popularity of soda alternatives in the developing countries. For example, the company has greatly benefited from investments in Dell Valle and Maaza juice brands, in countries such as Latin America and Asia."
EMC: Analyzing The Opportunity In The All-Flash Array Market,Jan.14.14,"Everyone wants a piece of flashEMC Corporation's (EMC) newly launched all-flash array XtremIO is gaining traction with Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, or VDI, projects. VDI hosts a desktop operating system, or OS, within a virtual server, eliminating installation of traditional OS in between. Previous VDI projects often failed because they were attempting to replicate pilot test results in actual production, but this is possible using XtremIO. Around 70% of the XtremIO deals involve VDI projects, and it will open up new opportunities for XtremIO.The demand of flash array storage is growing fast since traditional hard disk drives have failed to live up to the expectations of Big Data and Cloud storage. As a result, companies are now more inclined to use flash array in their data centers. The flash array market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 58.5% and reach $1.2 billion by 2015. Looking at this opportunity, different storage companies like NetApp (NTAP), Pure Storage, and Nimbus Data have decided to launch storage systems using flash technology. However, competition is not something new to EMC; it has competed with its peers successfully in the past. The competition is getting intense, as just a few days after EMC launched XtremIO, NetApp's also launched its new all-flash array storage system, EF550, along with its storage array E2700 and updated E5500 array. Through these launches, NetApp aims to target a wider audience with its E-series portfolio for those that want high speed from a flash solution.(Source: Permabit)Although, none of these companies have achieved a supreme position in flash array and each one has a competitive edge over the other in one way or another.XtremIO's advantage is its deduplication feature of ""always on,"" while NetApp allows customers the option to turn off deduplication since it affects the performance. However, the XtremIO array performance isn't impacted by deduplication, and it stores all the data in the DRAM. In comparison EMC, Nimbus uses significantly less DRAM, thus making it more cost effective, while supporting deduplication. Nimbus data boasts of its lower power consumption; it is ten times more power efficient than EMC's XtremIO."
EMC Corporation: Big Data And Cloud Computing Are The Future,Mar.12.14,"EMC Corporation (EMC) is the world's largest provider of data storage systems. EMC offers data storage, information security, analytics, and virtualization, cloud computing, and other services that enable companies to store, manage, analyze and protect data.IT spending was lower than expected during 2013 however EMC experienced growth across all of its business segments. The increasing demand for high-end business storage including EMC VMAX, Data Domain and increasing demand for emerging business storage due to strong demand of EMC Isilon, EMC Atom and EMC VPLEX contributed towards a 4% growth in the information storage segment with revenues of $10,694 million.Since its formation in 2013 Pivotal has made good progress and generated $110 million in revenues with a growth rate of 4%. To capture increasing demand for platform-as-a-service (NASDAQ:PAAS) and accelerate its future growth prospects, Pivotal has recently launched Pivotal One comprising next-generation data fabrics, application fabrics and Cloud Foundry, a cloud-independent PaaS that is gaining momentum and becoming the standard for PaaS.The increased sales volume resulted in more revenues from VMware licenses and $2,225 million in revenues from VMware's virtual infrastructure with a growth rate of 9%.The increasing data security concerns in the digital age have increased the usage of information security systems and RSA information security segment's revenues of $453 increased by 10% for fiscal year 2013. This increase was primarily driven by growth both in identity and protection and security management and compliance businesses. Security continues to become increasingly more important in IT decisions and RSA continues to benefit from this trend with its advanced and data driven security offerings."
Uni-Pixel's Declining Production Capability And Inconsequential Purchase Orders,Jan. 3.14,"A review of past disclosures by Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) shows that the company has repeatedly misrepresented its touch sensor production capability. Since 2010, Uni-Pixel's capacity targets have been dropping from 32 to 10 to 3 to less than 1 million sqft/month, while capex requirements have been rising, and actual production and shipping deadlines have been shifting further into the future. In essence, the company, with the approval of the Board of Directors, has been operating a Techno Ponzi scheme designed to extract money from new investors and partners to pursue what appears to be world-changing technologies but without ever producing any deliverables. Consequently, the company should be worth no more than its current cash holdings plus the liquidation value of its fixed assets, or about $5 a share.An announcement of first purchase orders, such as the one in November, does not necessarily validate either Uni-Pixel's manufacturing process or its ability to commercialize its product. Despite similar announcements of initial purchase orders and shipments, the company's other overhyped products, the finger-print resistant protective cover film and the cover glass replacement film, each with hundreds of millions of dollars in potential annual sales and 50%-plus gross margin target, have failed to generate any meaningful revenues in the past five years.The specific capacity numbers may also have relevance to the SEC investigation into the company's agreements disclosed in November. While Uni-Pixel never revealed the detailed contractual terms, it claimed that it received the two $5 million ""engineering"" payments from its PC OEM partner, rumored to be Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), and from its ecosystem partner, identified as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), for the build out of a dedicated 1 million sqft/month production capacity each. However, as detailed below, the company previously claimed that it had already installed and calibrated 10 million sqft/month of capacity in July 2011. In other words, if the company were truthful about its capacity in 2011 and its agreements in 2013, then Dell and Intel were simply duped into paying for capacity that was already there."
Should You Think Twice Before Investing In Varonis?,Mar. 3.14,"Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS), developer of data management software solutions, had an extremely good initial public offering last Friday. The company saw overwhelming demand for its stock, driving the price up 100% from its initial offering of $22 to $44 at the end of the trading day, reflecting a $173M market capitalization for the company. Varonis appeals to investors as it provides a service that seems almost impossible to live without these days, and that is expected to become more important in the future: ""big data"" technology that enables enterprises to extract value from the large amount of data already stored in its servers.Click to enlarge images.The term ""big data"" was first introduced by Meta Group (now Gartner) analyst Doug Laney to define an amount of data so large and complex that it can hardly be accessed and used efficiently. Laney referred in his article to the three Vs as the catalysts for data growth: volume (amount of data), velocity (speed and frequency of data in and out), and variety (types of data). In the last few years, life has become more digitized as we use smartphones to update our Facebook status, tablets to read the newspaper, laptops to create a spreadsheet, and smart TVs to watch our favorite YouTube channel. All these examples use data generated by users and shared with other users.According to the IDC publication ""The Digital Universe In 2020,"" digital data created, replicated, and consumed in the world will grow from 130 exabytes (1 exabyte = 1 million terabytes) in 2005 to 40,000 exabytes in 2020 (as shown in the graph above on the left). Infrastructure investment will increase by 40% between 2012 and 2020 to support that (see the graph above on the right)."
There Is A Lot More To Document Security Systems Than The Facebook And LinkedIn Lawsuits,Jan.22.14,"Shares of Document Security Systems (NYSEMKT:DSS) have been hit hard since the January 14, 29014 announcement that the US District Court of Northern California issued a stay of proceedings in the Bascom Research case against Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and LinkedIn (LNKD). Bascom Research is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DSS. The stay was issued in light of Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int'l, a Supreme Court case covering the patentability of software. The slide was apparently fueled by blanket statements made in an article that followed the stay news. This gives value investors the opportunity to accumulate cheap shares while others sell due to either fear or ignorance, or both. For a more comprehensive and intelligent discussion on the stay implications, investors are encouraged to read the excellent article written by the Markman Advisors and published on January 6, 2013.All eyes will now be on the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int'l. It's anticipated that a ruling will likely be made in June. As a result, the Markman hearing for DSS is expected to be rescheduled after June 2014.Regarding the stay decision, Jeff Ronaldi, CEO of DSS stated: ""Document Security Systems, along with other owners of important software intellectual property, look forward to the results of the Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank case, which should help to clarify what subject matter is patentable under US Law.""The Supreme Court is expected to issue its decision in the CLS Bank case by June 2014, which means that any stay should only last six months, at the most. Furthermore, Facebook and LinkedIn have indicated that they only intend to invalidate one of the four asserted patents on the grounds of patent ineligibility. That means, even if the CLS Bank decision resolves in their favor, presumably only one of the patents will be affected, and the cases will nevertheless need to continue.Investors appear to forget that DSS is a lot more than lawsuits against FB and LNKD. In fact, the analyst covering the stock has assigned $1.65 to the company's core businesses, and an ultra-conservative $2.35 for potential patent wins against Facebook, LinkedIn, and real money that will result from the cases that have already been settled: Broadvision (BVSN), Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE), and Novell (NASDAQ:NOVL). Regarding the settled cases, carrying royalties ranging from 4 - 5%, the 10-Qs are still reflecting unchanged technology and licensing revenues. Licensing revenues typically come 6-9 months AFTER a deal is signed. I expect licensing revenues from settled cases to start showing up in quarterly filings."
The Private Market Value Strategy: Part 1 - Discounted Assets,"Feb. 14, 2014 4:58 PM ET","In the past few years, my investment strategy has evolved and is now best described as being dominated by an analysis of private market value. By ""private market value,"" I mean the value that a potential buyer would assign to an entire company. It can manifest itself in takeovers, LBOs, and transactions completely outside of public markets in which a privately held company is purchased.This approach essentially ignores technical analysis and does not attempt to determine whether the ""market"" is over- or under-priced (although, inevitably, more stocks will be attractive on a private market value basis in a down market). If you follow this approach, you will not necessarily be in tune with trends. On the other hand, an investor following this approach will discover that he or she often owns stocks that are also owned by certain notable value investors (e.g., Carl Icahn) and that ""activist investors"" often arise and try to get management to ""unlock"" the inherent value of the company through various restructuring plans. You also will tend to find many of the companies in your portfolio engaged in share repurchases - reflecting management's conviction that the stock is a bargain. Another phenomenon will likely be the discovery that a number of your holdings are subject to takeover or leveraged buyout activity. You will have to be patient because the price may take a long time to catch up to the value, but, in the long run, the strategy should work very well.The problem is that assessing private market value can be hard work and requires a certain amount of judgment. It involves more than simply plugging numbers into a formula and printing out the result. For that very reason, I generally like to buy at a significant discount to value.I am going to start in this article with the most straightforward situation. This is the situation in which the company is selling at a meaningful discount to the readily ascertainable value of its assets. These situations arise for a number of reasons; as noted above, they are much more prevalent at the bottom of the market and, in early 2009, looking for these opportunities was like shooting fish in a barrel. Let's first go through some basic steps in the analysis."
Google Or Apple: Which Is The Better Long Term Bet?,May.16.14,"It seems that over the past several years Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) / (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continue to play the game anything you can do I can do better. Both tech giants have their own way about building and developing their own brand, but as an investor the question of which one is the better investment is something that is always a bit allusive. Below we will examine both firms' fundamentals, products, pipeline, sales growth, and overall long term potential to try and come to an answer on which is the better stock to own.AppleApple announced during its blockbuster second quarter earnings announcement that it planned to split its stock by 7:1 effective June 9th. This split at today's market price ($590) would have the ""new"" stock price start trading at $84.28 per share. This news comes just a few months after Google split its own stock in what I would consider to be a very creative ""stock split"". The firm issued class C shares in a 1:1 exchange for the existing A shares. This move effectively cut Google A shares in half or created a 2:1 split.Apple's stock split should have a net positive effect on the stock. For starters it will make the stock more attractive to retail investors simply because of the effective purchase price being cheaper. Second, it will make the stock more attractive for larger and mid-sized funds to pick up and have as a part of their portfolio. Thirdly, given that the effective price will be less I think there is a good chance that Apple could be added to Dow Jones Industrial Average index. At its new price the weighting would not dramatically affect the Dow's daily price movements on down days for Apple."
Super Micro Computer: A Founder/CEO Culture-Driven Success Story,Mar. 7.14,"Aberrations are worth exploring. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is an aberration. What else to call a company that's profited every year since its 1993 founding, and outgrown peers organically by sustained ~10% rates, despite never possessing more than 3% market share in a brutally competitive industry? Let's explore.But first, some context. SMCI smashed estimates last quarter, as sales spiked 22% y/y and 15% sequentially, a big divergence from the mid-single digit industry trend. Quarterly earnings almost doubled y/y to $0.35. The stock spiked several dollars, and analysts upgraded their estimates across the forward spectrum. Growth was geographically broad-based, but fastest in Asia, which rose to 23% of sales from 17% y/y, resulting from SMCI's commitment to grab share in the rising region, executed in recent years by building a huge new manufacturing capacity in Taiwan.Shares trade at 15x $1.40 forward 12-month earnings. The valuation bar has been set moderately, and SMCI will leap it if history guides.Alright, let's get to the meat. The purpose of this report isn't to precisely value SMCI, nor to examine its near-term outlook; it is to explain the puzzle of its fantastic sustained performance despite obvious constraints. If we understand that puzzle and identify the source of its success, then we might understand its long-run future.It's common knowledge that the PC industry is brutal. Yesterday's leaders regularly land in tomorrow's bankruptcy court. The industry is super-competitive, because incumbents lack any kind of entry barrier. There's no loyalty; I'll buy Dell today and IBM (NYSE:IBM) next time. There's little proprietary technology; computer components are IP-intensive, but boxes aren't. There are no network effects; Microsoft's operating systems enjoy the benefits of a massive base of 3rd-party software development standardized to its software, but again, the box makers don't. And the industry is enormous relative to the minimum scale at which scale benefits expire."
Can ARM Holdings Sustain Its Growth In 2014?,Jan.24.14,"The ""Internet of Things,"" or IoT, is a relatively new trend that is taking off in the connected-device market. This concept involves the manufacturing of a multi-purpose device that can have both intelligence and connectivity. IoT combines three elements: one or more environmental sensors (temperature, pressure, yaw, pitch etc.), a smart computer to process the data gathered by the sensor, and a wireless radio to connect the smart sensor to the Internet. The entire process is handled by a very low-cost chip, or microcontroller. ARM's (ARMH) power-efficient microcontroller, or MCU, designs make the company a preferred choice among manufacturers, and thus the company has gained a leading position in this market. Around 2 billion devices based on ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers were shipped in 2012, resulting in ARM's gaining 18% market share in 2012. Meanwhile, in connectivity (radios) the company gained 75% market share in 2012.IoT provides ARM an opportunity to increase its total addressable market beyond mobile device-based processors. The IoT is expected to reach 26 billion devices by 2020, from a mere 0.9 billion in 2009. This figure is far ahead of other connected devices such as smartphones, tablets and PCs, which in totality will reach 7.3 billion units in the same year.Thus, ARM is set to dominate this rapidly growing market and its popularity can be substantiated by its biggest rival, Intel (INTC), also using an ARM-based chip in the smartwatch prototype it revealed at the 2014 CES. This smartwatch is powered by an Intel system on chip, or SoC, which contains an ARM cpu inside.Diversifying its market provides ARM an opportunity to offset the potential risk of a slowdown in smartphone sales. It is also looking to establish a major presence in the server market, which is dominated by Intel with its x86 architecture. ARM is trying to leverage its power-efficient capabilities to target the lower end of the server market. Top server hardware manufacturers such as Dell and HP have already announced their server designs on ARM architecture, which will be launched in this year."
"Sphere 3D: Investors Falling For The Same Old Tricks, Fair Value Is Zero",Apr.14.14,"Following questionable characters involved in past fraudulent schemes is one of the most successful approaches to identifying compelling short-selling candidates. A background check of the insiders at Sphere 3D (TSX:ANY, SPIHF) reveals what may be a hard pill to swallow for current investors: That Sphere 3D's management is most likely misleading you. Sphere 3D is a mirage! Not only that, the management has pulled this trick at least once before. Below, we will outline its shady history and how it is repeating what it did with Biosign Technologies (TSX:BIO, OTC:BITKF) during 2010 to 2011, but with a different shell company. The companies have the same CEO, the same management team, almost the same press releases, the same partners and are telling nearly identical stories. Long investors, you have been warned: get out now.What Is Sphere 3D, and What Does It Do?Sphere 3D is a development stage software company. Its flagship product, Glassware 2.0 (yet-to-be-released), is an ultra-thin application virtualization system that will allow any device to access any software virtualized on a private cloud. Sounds amazing, right? But there is another company that does the same thing. You may have heard of it: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). And while Microsoft has decades of successful products and billions in revenues and profits, Sphere 3D could not be more different. It has been around for five years and has lost at least $5.2 million since inception, with no meaningful intellectual property or revenues to date. It begs the question: How can a company that has spent less than $200k cash on R&D, which should be the core of any emerging cloud software company, possibly have a market cap of $209 million?"
3 Opportunities To Grab Before The Great Market Crash Ahead,"May 23, 2014 7:32 PM ET","My economy and market cycles continue to point to mid-2014 into late 2019 as the period when endless artificial stimulus will finally fail… when the great housing market bubbles that have yet to burst finally do… when we'll see an even greater global series of market crashes… when debt will finally be allowed to deleverage… and when we'll see a 1930s-style deflation.Remember, the winter shake-out season follows the fall bubble boom, where debt exploded and all financial sectors bubbled up in value. Now, when the bubble finally bursts, almost all financial assets and the stock market will suffer.That means that asset allocation, the Holy Grail of financial advisors and the comfort blanket of set-it-and-forget-it investors, just won't work! They're dressing themselves in swim shorts and flip-flops for a trip to the Arctic.Remember the crash from late 2007 into early 2009? How did asset allocation work for you then, when almost everything in the market went down: stocks (small cap and large cap), international and emerging markets, real estate, commodities, gold and silver, corporate and high-yield bonds?Where was there to hide?The only place to ""hide"" was in the U.S. dollar and in the highest quality government bonds from Germany to the U.S.The first thing to understand is that the field of opportunities narrows greatly in the economic winter season, where deflation and deleveraging is the order of the day. So what's an investor to do during a time like this (from now into 2019)?There are three types of opportunities:Opportunity #1: Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe clearest thing to do during an economic winter season is to play it safe. Preserve any gains you made during the bubble years by selling risk assets, like stocks and real estate, commodities and gold and silver, and simply be in cash."
2 Problems With Hewlett-Packard's Turnaround,Feb.22.14,"Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) turnaround remains intact. On Thursday afternoon, the company reported Q4 results that beat analyst estimates and own previous guidance:· First quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.90, up 10% from the prior-year period, versus the previously provided outlook of $0.82 to $0.86 per share· First quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.74, up 17% from the prior-year period, versus the previously provided outlook of $0.60 to $0.64 per share· First quarter net revenue of $28.2 billion, down 1% from the prior-year period and flat on a constant currency basis· First quarter cash flow from operations of $3.0 billion, up 17% from the prior-year period· Returned $843 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter· Improved operating company net cash position by $1.6 billion, the eighth consecutive quarterly improvement of over $1 billionBut there are two problems with the company's turnaround: The first problem is that it is uneven, concentrated in two segments, Personal Systems and Enterprise Group. Other segments and most notably Enterprise Services and Software continued to decline:Personal Systems revenue was up 4% year over year with a 3.3% operating margin. Commercial revenue increased 8% and Consumer revenue declined 3%.

Riding High On AeroGrow,Mar.10.14,"Editor's Note: This article covers stocks trading at less than $1 per share and/or with less than a $100 million market cap. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.In this article, I will discuss the opportunities and challenges for AeroGrow International (OTCQB:AERO), a company which I previously blogged about on PTTResearch.com. My analysis will center around AERO's opportunities and strategic plan. It will also draw comparisons to one of its closest comps, GrowLife (OTCQB:PHOT), whose market cap was 16 times higher than AERO's on the day of PHOT's 52-week high of $0.47, despite AERO being the larger organization.This is not to disparage PHOT's opportunity. Both companies are well-positioned to take advantage of accelerating market and political trends. However, as I will show, AERO has products and distribution partners, like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Target (NYSE:TGT) to drive superior results.In addition, AERO has four significant catalysts: 1) Scotts Miracle-Gro's (NYSE:SMG) substantial vested interest in the company -- in fact, SMG is positioned to benefit greatly from its role 2) the re-launch of product line that went from $0 to nearly $40M in 2 years during its initial launch, 3) accelerating demand for organic produce, and 4) the growing trend of marijuana legalization in the U.S.Because of these and other factors (which I will discuss), I believe the market cap gap between PHOT and AERO should continue to narrow markedly in the coming months.Let's dive in…For starters, according to the National Gardening Association, 85 million households are active in gardening. 36 million households are believed to participate in food gardening. 13 million households are participating in fresh herb gardening. These are huge numbers considering that there are 115 million households in the U.S."
Gigamon: High-Growth Value Stock And Likely Takeover Candidate,May. 8.14,"Gigamon (NYSE:GIMO) is a network visibility, monitoring and security vendor that went public in 2013, and is still fairly undiscovered and unfamiliar to investors. It is not your typical IPO company as it has developed market leading technologies, has been profitable for several years, and is growing its top line at 25%-35% YoY.The company has grown top line in excess of 30% over the past several years, and this growth is expected to continue at 25%-35% given the company's nascent 7% penetration rate of its TAM. This future growth will come from underpenetrated enterprise markets including Fortune 1000 companies, international expansion, further penetration into the service provider market, and expansion into security offerings. The company's TAM (total addressable market) is estimated between $2 and $3 billion growing at double digits annually driven by cloud and big data, as well as the rapid transition from 1G Ethernet connections to 10G, 40G and 100G connections.Gigamon is a likely strategic M&A candidate given its technology and reasonable valuation. Among potential suitors are traditional switch and routing companies (Cisco, Brocade, and Juniper) as well as Oracle, IBM, Hewlett Packard, Dell, Riverbed, F5 Networks with Oracle, and Cisco making the most strategic sense.Oracle has made acquisitions of complementary technologies by buying session-border controller specialist Acme Packet and network optimization specialist Tekelec at premiums of 8 and 10 times their revenues, respectively. Gigamon's leading technology and products would bolster Oracle's fledgling network tools solutions and its hardware business (formerly Sun) in its effort to further diversify into enterprise network and service provider markets. Oracle needs Gigamon to solidify its data center, cloud and big data offerings as the industry transitions from 1G to 10G, 40G and 100G Ethernet connections. For Cisco, Gigamon's technology will be value adding to its switching and data center offerings. And Cisco has to cherish Gigamon's 75%-77% gross margins and targeted operating margins of 23%-28%. For both Riverbed and F5 Networks, acquisition of Gigamon would make strategic sense in terms of technology and addressable markets. For example, Riverbed acquired network performance specialist Opnet for 6 times revenues and already closely partners with Gigamon. It may also consider acquiring Gigamon to fend off the acquisition proposal by an activist investor Elliott Management."
Intel Powers Up The 3D Printing Revolution,Jan. 8.14,"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is not satisfied in conquering the tablets market and Telematics industry. The world's largest semiconductor company also wants to lead in the 3D printing gold rush. Intel is teaming up with 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) in bringing the 3D printing technology to the household. 3D Systems is the pioneer and emerging leader of 3D printing technology.This latest development is a big positive for INTC. Judging from the one-year 135.75% price increase of DDD, the market is very much in love with the future of 3D printing. Intel is being shrewd again in riding the next big thing of the printing industry.As a quick way of propagating mainstream 3D printing, 3D Systems is bundling its Sense Software with upcoming Intel-equipped mobile computing products. Sense is a 3D scanning, 3D editing, and 3D printing software. It will be used to digitize real world objects via Intel's new embedded RealSense 3D camera. The deal also calls for 3D systems to provide its 3D scanning technology as part and parcel of Intel's Software Development Kit (NYSEARCA:SDK) so developers can further extend the uses of Intel's RealSense 3D Camera.Intel's RealSense 3D CameraAs part of its bid to dominate the tablet and mobile computing market, Intel revealed that its new RealSense 3D camera will come integrated in 2H 2014 releases of Ultrabooks, Intel-powered tablets, All-in-One computers, and 2-in-1 notebooks. NEC, Lenovo, HP, Fujitsu, Dell, Asus, Acer are all on board to deliver products this year with integrated RealSense 3D cameras. Most of which will probably run Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows 8 OS>The RealSense 3D camera offers human eye-like depth perception, allowing smart devices to see and interpret objects before it in three dimensions. This product exemplifies Intel's thrust towards Perceptual Computing. It's no longer the stuff of science fiction movies: Intel is delivering the future now. RealSense is the world's smallest embedded 3D/2D camera module with full 1080P HD sensor."
NSN: Nokia's Largest Segment - How Much Is It Worth?,Jan. 7.14,"IntroductionWith the sale of Nokia's (NYSE:NOK) smart and mobile phone division to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nokia's largest business division is now Nokia Solutions and Networks - also known as NSN. The company/division has often been overlooked since it historically hasn't been very profitable and because it is less glamorous than the smartphone division.However, over the last year, NSN has successfully implemented a restructuring of the company, and is today, according to my estimations, Nokia's most valuable asset.The restructuring of NSNBack in late 2011, it was clear that changes were needed. As can be seen in the below diagram, the division had not made any real money over the past 8 quarters.Therefore a restructuring process was implemented with the intention of returning NSN to a healthy level of profitability. While the plan consisted of a lot of elements, the most notable changes were;A reduction of the global workforce to 17,000A new organizational structureA reduction of the numbers of suppliersDivestment of non-core businessesOver a 2 year-period, NSN expected that the restructuring would reduce operating costs by 1B Euro on an annual basis. Some may be critical of management for not fully accomplishing the target, as OPEX (so far) has just been reduced by 510M Euro, but I believe that number actually underestimates total savings related to the restructuring.According to a research report by Morgan Stanley (from 29th November), some costs have been moved from COGS to OPEX, which has resulted in a larger-than-expected increase in gross margins. This can easily be seen by looking at Nokia's financial statements as gross margin has increased from 27% (pre-restructuring) to 36% over the past twelve months."
Can Apple Dominate The PC Market Too?,May.11.14,"IntroductionIt is a well-accepted fact that the premium Mac is on the rise. With superior quality, innovation, improved value and a growing customer base, there's good reason for it to be and in the future I expect the trend to continue. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has shown that they are resisting the declining PC market while capturing market share by showing continuous growth of their PC sales. Fiscal 2014 Q1 posted a 19% year-over-year increase in Mac sales and last quarter posted a 5% increase. With Mac pulling in $5.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, it only made up about 11% of their total revenue. This is a narrow revenue stream, but the Mac is still an important core to Apple's success and for this article I will cover the commonly overlooked Mac and discuss the potential for continued growth.(Author's Note: I feel that it would make sense to state that I have continuously used Windows and my most used computer is a Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Surface Pro.)Inexpensive Macs are leading to major growthAs mentioned in Apple's conference call, for 31 out of 32 quarters, Mac showed a continuous increase in market share. Apple has lowered prices of the MacBook into very reasonable price ranges making them more attractive than ever before. In 2013, the MacBook Pro saw a price drop in February from $1700 to $1500 and then in October from $1500 to the current $1300. These decreases led Apple to a year-over-year 5% increase in units sold for the quarter. Revenue wise, there was only an increase of 1.3% due to the reductions lowering the average cost of each unit by around $44. Although this may have slightly eaten into profits, when considering the declining PC trend, any increase in market share, unit sales and revenue can still be considered a win.In addition to continued price drops, Apple has recently dropped the price of its 11 and 13-inch MacBook Air to $899 and $999 while slapping on improved processors. Not only does this put the 11-inch version at half the cost of prestigious launch version of Air in 2008, but also serves as an entry into an enormous market; annually, a $63B market according to J.P. Morgan (NYSE:JPM). This consists of the $500-$1000 range of mobile PC which in 2013 accounted for nearly 100m units making up nearly 55% of market. As a side note, this also places the Surface Pro 2 at the same price of the Air, excluding the almost mandatory keyboard covers. With an additional price drops on the Air, it is highly likely that the momentum of their improving market share will improve at a potentially increased rate."
Why The Allocation In Portfolios To The S&P 500 Is Sub-Optimal And What To Do About It,"Feb. 20, 2014 7:20 AM ET","Among my conversations with asset allocators, the anecdotal evidence suggests that the largest allocation in equity portfolios is the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY), which has become a proxy for ""the market.""However, traditional indexes such as the S&P 500 have major flaws in their construction. First, the indexes are market capitalization weighted. By the time companies become large constituents of the index, they're often past their innovative and high-growth phases, and more often than not act as a significant drag on performance.Consider the chart below. According to Ned Davis Research, ""popularity kills."" Since 1972, the S&P 500 increased nearly 5,000%. Yet, owning the top stock in the S&P 500 by market capitalization increased in value approximately 400%.Copyright 2013 Ned Davis Research, Inc. Further distribution prohibited without prior permission. All Rights Reserved. See NDR Disclaimer here. For data vendor disclaimers refer here.The stocks that have been among those carrying the highest weight in the index include AT&T (NYSE:T), Altria (NYSE:MO) (formerly Philip Morris), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), General Electric (NYSE:GE), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Most people would consider these to be ""good"" if not ""great"" companies. But, great companies do not necessarily make for great stocks.Another study (source: Daniel Solin) measured the performance of the S&P 500 from 1957-1997. During that time period, the index was up over 8,500% with dividends reinvested. However, of the 74 stocks in the index during the entire time period, only 12 stocks outperformed the index itself.In our own research, we extended a portfolio of holdings to include the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 by market capitalization. Typically, these stocks comprise approximately 20% of the index by weight. These too are household names and include Exxon, Apple, IBM, Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Microsoft, GE, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), AT&T, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). In our tests from 1983-2012, the S&P 500 increased over 2,600% while the top 10 stocks in the index rose in value just 800%."
Dell Inc. Bonds: How Much Risk And How Much Return?,Jul.24.13,"In this note we analyze the current levels and past history of default probabilities for Dell Inc. (NASDAQ:DELL) and we compare those default probabilities to credit spreads on 292 bond trades in 8 different bond issues on July 22, 2013. Trading volume in Dell Inc. bonds on that day totaled $37.3 million. Assuming the recovery rate in the event of default would be the same on all bond issues, a sophisticated investor who has moved beyond legacy ratings seeks to maximize revenue per basis point of default risk from each incremental investment, subject to risk limits on macro-factor exposure on a fully default-adjusted basis. We analyze the maturities where the credit spread/default probability ratio is highest for Dell Inc. We also consider whether or not a reasonable investor would judge the firm to be ""investment grade"" under the June 2012 rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010.Definition of Investment GradeOn June 13, 2012, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency published the final rules defining whether a security is ""investment grade,"" in accordance with Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. The new rules delete reference to legacy credit ratings and replace them with default probabilities. The web page explaining the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's new rules defining investment grade and related guidance can be found here.Term Structure of Default ProbabilitiesMaximizing the ratio of credit spread to matched maturity default probabilities requires that default probabilities be available at a wide range of maturities. The graph below shows the current default probabilities for Dell Inc. ranging from one month to 10 years on an annualized basis. The default probabilities range from 0.36% at one month to 0.17% at 1 year and 0.78% at ten years."

(NASDAQ:DELL) updating the analysis in our note of July 24, 2013 in the light of the recently announced special dividend contemplated by the merger agreement with Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners. We compare Dell Inc. default probabilities to credit spreads on 203 bond trades in 10 different bond issues with principal value of $28.7 million on October 21, 2013. We continue to find that Dell Inc. bonds offer a slightly better than average ratio of credit spread to default probability risk, although the firm's default probabilities have shifted slightly since our last report. We analyze the maturities where the credit spread/default probability ratio is highest for Dell Inc.Background to the Analysis of Dell Inc.Institutional investors around the world are required to prove to their audit committees, senior management, and regulators that their investments are in fact ""investment grade."" For many investors, ""investment grade"" is an internal definition; for many banks and insurance companies ""investment grade"" is also defined by regulators. We consider whether or not a reasonable U.S. bank investor would judge Dell Inc. to be ""investment grade"" under the June 13, 2012 rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which requires that credit rating references be eliminated from U.S. government regulations. Section 939A states the following:SEC. 939A. REVIEW OF RELIANCE ON RATINGS.(A) AGENCY REVIEW.

Dell And HP Beat Apple On PC Market Share Growth,Oct.18.13,"According to a recent report from research firm IDC, for the first time in recent memory, both Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) beat Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in terms of quarter market share growth. Where Apple lost 11.2%, Dell saw market share tick up by 2.3%, while HP added 3.5%. While there are plenty of explanations for this apparent shift in growth, and I am certainly not suggesting that Apple is ""in trouble,"" the news could be a good sign for the beleaguered PC makers.DELL data by YChartsIn the video below, I discuss various statistics included in the IDC report and what they could mean for the PC industry, and specifically for Dell and HP. While one quarter does not make a trend, if these two companies can get some positive traction, their beaten down stocks might suddenly become quite interesting.

Dell Inc. Bonds: Tallying The Losses,"Nov. 28, 2013 2:34 AM ET","In this update of our October 23, 2013 analysis, we track the impact on Dell Inc. bond holders of the close of the merger agreement with Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners. In this note, we re-analyze the credit spreads for Dell Inc. We look at data for 262 bond trades in 8 different Dell Inc. bond issues with principal value of $88.2 million on November 26, 2013. In our October 23 post, we declined to forecast the behavior of one individual, Michael Dell, in favor of waiting to see what he does. Our analysis shows that bond holders of Dell Inc. have lost a substantial amount of value as Dell and his partners intentionally raised the probability of bankruptcy and the volatility of returns to equity holders (themselves) by aggressively leveraging the firm in an industry where leverage is rare for a reason.This drop in long-maturity bond value came about after the buyout of Dell Inc. closed on October 29, financed in part by a loan of $7.2 billion. The firm's legacy ratings were downgraded to junk by three legacy rating agencies on February 5, September 11, and October 30. This article shows that the greatest losses since trading on October 21 have come at maturities of 15 years and longer.Background to the Analysis of Dell Inc.Institutional investors around the world are required to prove to their audit committees, senior management, and regulators that their investments are in fact ""investment grade.""

Comparing IBM's Hardware Segment With Its Competitors,Jun.11.13,"The systems and technology segment generates a substantial portion, 17%, of International Business Machines' (NYSE:IBM) total revenue. The performance of the hardware segment has been a drag on the company's consolidated performance. In this report, IBM's hardware segment's performance will be compared with competitors Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ), and Dell Inc. (NASDAQ:DELL). Is IBM's poor performance company specific, or is the hardware industry going through a period of declining revenue? How does IBM's performance compare to competitors?In the first section, the components of the hardware segments of the companies will be covered. The second section covers the historic performance of the hardware segments. The final section discusses the historic performance of the hardware segments.The recent performance of the hardware segments were poor, generally. I don't think there will be much improvement in the current fiscal year. That said, IBM's performance was in-line with its peers while Dell led the pack.Defining The Hardware SegmentsIBM's systems and technology segments is comprised of its systems, storage, and microelectronics businesses. The systems business provides a range of general purpose and integrated systems designed and optimized for specific business, public, and scientific computing needs. The storage business provides data storage products and solutions that allow clients to retain and manage rapidly growing, complex volumes of digital information. The microelectronics business provides semiconductor design and manufacturing primarily for use in IBM systems and storage products as well as delivering semiconductors and related services to external clients.HP hardware segment was formerly known as the Enterprise Servers, Storage, and Networking segment. The segment consists of four parts: The Industry Standard Servers, Business Critical Systems, Storage, and Networking. Industry Standard Servers offers primarily entry-level and mid-range ProLiant servers, which primarily run Windows, Linux, and virtualization platforms from Microsoft, VMware, Inc.

The Billionaires: 2013 Results For Some Of America's Richest,"Dec. 20, 2013 11:00 AM ET","One billion dollars in $100 bills:The difference between $999,999,999 and $1 billion is a lot more than $1. With $1 less than $1 billion, you are just some guy but with $1 billion, you become ""billionaire X"" for the rest of your life or at least the rest of your life unless you manage to lose your billion dollars. Our political debate is dominated by a choice to demonize and envy such people on one side or to learn, copy and someday to join them on the other. As Charlie Munger said,What good is envy? It's the one sin you can't have any fun at. It's 100% destructive.Prof. Thomas Sowell said that,I have never understood why it is 'greed' to want to keep the money that you've earned, but not greed to want to take someone else's money.So, I will leave the demonizing and envying to others and will instead focus on learning and copying. It has been a fine year for America's top billionaires. According to a recent study from Wealth-X, these are the top gainers for 2013:It should almost go without saying that all figures are in US$ billion.Unlike wealth gained though salaries or inheritance, most of these gains were through the capital markets. While capital markets may increase inequality (because everyone increasing a given percentage increases the difference between individual wealth), they also are more replicable than other forms of wealth creation."
Memo To Intel Bulls: You People Are Dead Wrong,Sep.10.13,"On October 26, 1999, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) were both added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average as component stocks. This event arguably marked the apex of the PC Revolution as a driver of the technology economy. Accounting for splits, Intel then traded for $27.53 per share, while also operating with 8.7 million shares of common stock outstanding on its balance sheet. Heading into Q4 1999, Intel executives managed a corporation carrying $240 billion in market capitalization. On September 6, 2013, Intel stock closed out the trading session at $22.67, after claiming 5 million shares of common stock outstanding within its latest Q3 2013 financial report. This recent stock market performance calculates out to roughly $110 billion in Intel market capitalization. In fourteen years, the size of Intel's business has literally been slashed in half.Intel management decisions to return larger amounts of capital back to investors, in the form of dividends and stock buybacks have done nothing for shareholder growth. Over the past twenty-four months, Intel has shifted its focus towards aggressive research and development spending, in order to finally establish a beachhead within a mobile chip market dominated by the ARM - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) alliance. Intel bulls are now arguing their case on two fronts. Firstly, the Intel bulls reason that extraordinary R&D spending is artificially depressing net income. Secondly, Intel cheerleaders assume R&D spending to be an up-front investment that will automatically materialize into future growth. Time, however, will prove that R&D spending at Intel is no panacea for growth, because the corporation now operates out of desperation. The situation is similar to a middling NFL franchise throwing money at a fee agent bust - in misguided hopes of exciting fans. Intel is still a strong sell.Intel R&D Spending By The NumbersBe advised that Intel fiscal years generally parallel calendar years. In 1999, during the halcyon days of the PC Revolution, Intel closed out the year with $7.3 billion in net income on $29.4 billion in revenue. Intel had grown net income by 20.5% over the prior year - to cap off a decade that began with a relatively meager $650 million in profits. Between 1997 and 1999, Intel spent 9.8% of annual revenue upon research and development, on average. This R&D allocation was largely in line with the rest of Intel's 1990's growth decade. At most, Intel spent a shade more than 13% of revenue in 1990 and 1992."
Where Have All The Apple Skeptics Gone?,Oct.25.13,"One thing I have noticed over the past three months and especially since the successful launch of the new 5S & 5C versions of the iPhone in Mid-September is that the skeptics of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) seemed to have disappeared into the woodwork. Of course, a stock chart like the one below tends to silence pessimists.(Click to enlarge)I don't know about most Apple investors, but I kind of miss all the ""Has Apple lost its Mojo?"", ""Why Apple misses Steve Jobs"" and ""Is Tim Cook the right man to lead Apple?"" stories that were a hallmark of the financial press as the shares fell from a high of $705 a share in September of last year to under $400 a share in late June.The contrarian in me always feels better when a major investment of mine is treated to at least some skepticism. Other than the recent rapid rise in the stock price, the pessimism around the stock has receded for three major reasons.Evolutionary turns out to be ""good enough""One of the main themes of Apple skeptics prior to its recent rise in the stock was that the company could not innovate without Steve Jobs. Furthermore, they postulated Apple needed to develop a killer product in a new category (iTV or iWatch as examples) to get out of its funk.This thesis turned out to be embarrassing false. What the company needed to do was to have a successful launch of the new versions of its iPhones where it gets ~70% of its revenue from. Apple did add a neat new fingerprint sensor, a faster chip and longer battery life with the new 5S; but none of these new features could possibly be called ""revolutionary"".However, they turned out to be enough to ensure that Apple had the most successful launch of any of its versions of the iPhone to date. Initial weekend sales came in at 9mm versus the consensus calling for 5mm to 6mm units. Even better is it appears the new iPhones and the huge volume of sales they are driving will allow the company to arrest the recent year long decline in margins. This has caused analysts to up earnings estimates and raise price targets over the last month. It turns out ""evolutionary"" change isn't so bad after all."
The9's Privatization Outlook - Profits Eyed In Q4,Jul.17.13,"The9 (NASDAQ:NCTY) has spent more than $300 million over the past 5 years to develop its next generation of games. Stock price has fallen from $52 in 2007 to $3 today and $1.2 billion of market cap has been wiped out. Now finally, several major games will be launched during the second half of 2013. The9 is expected to return to profitability in 4Q 2013. Yet shareholders are losing faith and are selling shares at low levels. On the other hand, the Chairman / CEO Jun Zhu has been working on a potential privatization deal and has done share buyback aggressively. In addition, he purchased shares personally and aggressively. Shareholders with enough risk appetite should hold on to their tickets while preparing for the possibility of an upturn.The9 still has $89 million ($3.63 per share) of cash on its balance sheet. In addition, the company purchased its 14,000-square-meter office building in March 2007 in Pudong New Area in Shanghai. The building alone is currently worth more than $50 million ($2 per share) and its value grows at approximately 15%-20% per year. The company has almost no debt. Yet the entire market cap of The9 is now below $70 million, which is almost a rounding error compared to its market cap of $1.2 billion in 2007. The stock is trading below cash. In other words, at the current price, shareholders get the building for free, plus a pipeline of major games costing more than $300 million ($12.25 per share).The Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) situation has some similarities to that of The9. Dell's PC business is declining. And while it spends a lot of money on acquiring enterprise software and services businesses, the acquisition spending lowers net income and the payoff can be several years away."
25 Top Cash-Rich S&P 500 Non-Financial Companies,"Jun. 2, 2013 4:50 AM ET","Large U.S. companies hold billions of dollars in cash and cash-equivalents on their balance sheets. The largest of these 83 companies hold over $1.46 Trillion off-shore beyond the reach of the U.S. government according to a report by Bloomberg in March this year. Companies are hoarding such huge piles of cash overseas since they do not want to pay taxes if repatriated back home.They also hold high amounts cash and equivalents in the U.S., as they are unable to invest them in productive ways.While it would be better for all stakeholders if they put this cash hoard to work by building factories and expanding locally and globally, nowadays management and the boards that are supposed to monitor them in many firms are incompetent, selfish and lazy. They would rather waste shareholder wealth on share buybacks, acquisitions or simply help themselves by dipping into the cookie jar with outrageous pay packages, bonuses, stock options and other legally-allowed compensation schemes.The table below lists the Top 25 S&P 500 Non-Financial Companies by Cash & Short-Term Investments held on their balance sheets:S.No. Company Ticker Dividend Yield as of May 31, 2013 Cash ($Mil.) as of May 15, 2013 Sector1 General Electric GE 3.23% 79,390 Industrials2 Microsoft MSFT 2.68% 74,483 Technology3 Google GOOG N/A 50,098 Technology4 Cisco CSCO 2.89% 46,376 Technology5 Amgen AMGN 1.78% 42,075 Health Care6 Apple AAPL 2.74% 39,137 Technology7 Oracle ORCL 0.70% 33,407 Technology8 Pfizer PFE 3.31% 32,708 Health Care9 Ford F 2.70% 32,010 Discretionary10 Johnson & Johnson JNJ 3.04% 21,089 Health Care11 WellPoint WLP 1.95% 20,857 Health Care12 Chevron CVX 3.19% 19,048 Energy13 Coca-Cola KO 2.65% 18,428 Staples14 Intel INTC 3.75% 17,073 Technology15 Merck MRK 3.65% 16,141 Health Care16 UnitedHealth UNH 1.37% 16,088 Health Care17 Abbott Labs ABT 1.48% 15.174 Health Care18 QUALCOMM QCOM 2.18% 13,493 Technology19 Hewlett-Packard HPQ 2.36% 13,012 Technology20 Dell DELL 2.40% 12,777 Technology21 IBM IBM 1.85% 11,993 Technology22 Boeing BA 1.83% 11,853 Industrials23 Freeport-McMoRan FCX 4.11% 9,595 Materials24 Humana HUM 1.37% 9,539 Health Care25 eBay EBAY N/A 9,402 Technology"
Will Generic Competitors Of Enbrel Affect Amgen's Stock Price?,Jun.14.13,"A recent clinical study comparing Enbrel with three generic drugs showed comparable efficacy and safety in rheumatoid arthritis patients (Therapies for Active Rheumatoid Arthritis after Methotrexate Failure NEJM 061113). Importantly, the cost of the triple therapy is $1000 compared with $25,000 for Enbrel. This begs the question of whether a switch to a generic combination, in the face of looming healthcare costs, might reduce future sales for Enbrel (and other anti-TNF therapy). Here we assess Enbrel's impact on Amgen's (NASDAQ:AMGN) bottom line and its stock price. Using scenario analysis, our projection estimates that AMGN's intrinsic stock price is $117 if Enbrel sales grow at a 6% annual rate. However, in the worst case scenario, if Enbrel sales decline by 15% per year, AMGN's intrinsic stock price becomes $98. It appears that the market is factoring in the worst case scenario as AMGN is currently trading around $97-$98. We provide some arguments supporting the scenario that Enbrel sales will maintain modest growth, thus supporting a value above $98.We published an article on Amgen in April 2013 in which we described 4 factors contributing to AMGN's future earnings growth (Four Factors Driving Amgen's Stock Price To $102). One of the factors is the expiration of Amgen's partnership with Pfizer to co-promote Enbrel in the United States and Canada in November 2013. The termination of the partnership means that Amgen will keep the majority of future profits from Enbrel sales, which are estimated to add ~$800M of operating income to Amgen's income statement in 2014 and beyond. Under the assumption that Enbrel sales grow at a 6% annual rate, we derived an intrinsic value for AMGN stock price to be $117 using projected earnings growth and the discounted cash flow model (Our Model Suggests An Intrinsic Value Of $117 For Amgen).However, the Wall Street Journal recently reported an article citing a clinical study that raised concerns about future prospects for anti-TNF drugs, including Enbrel , Remicade (NYSE:JNJ), Simponi , Humira (NYSE:ABBV), and Cimzia (UCB) (AMGN Enbrel faces challenge from generic drug combination WSJ 061213, Therapies for Active Rheumatoid Arthritis after Methotrexate Failure NEJM 061113)."
"The New 'Intel Inside', Himax Technologies",Aug.14.13,"A fundamental shift has occurred in tech over the last decade. We used to be focused on processing power, ram and hard-drive size in relation to our devices. Instead of trying to work out which computer manufacturer would do best, it was easier to pick between Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro (NASDAQ:AMD) or SanDisk (SNDK). Hence all the ""Intel inside"" ads.The shift has obviously been to mobile. No arguments there. The smartphone wars are raging among Nokia NOK), Motorola/Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and many others, not forgetting the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) role. We all understand that switching to mobile has its limitations and as such are willing to put up with less physical storage and use the cloud instead. The one component which has become all important is Display. Previously, if you wanted better display you went and bought a bigger monitor. Screen size and quality became more important with laptops, but with the shift to smartphones, it is almost the entire device. With the advent of Google Glass, it is going to be even more significant.In this new world, there is one manufacturer who stands head and shoulders above the rest. The new equivalent to Intel, Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX). I have been long for a very long time, in fact almost 400% up from my starting position at $1.58 and still holding.Normally I would be taking my profits, but feel that would be like selling Apple in 2006 for $70 a share. So let's look at the reasons why.Like Intel before them they are in almost everything. Here is a list of some of their customers: SONY (NYSE:SNE), Sharp (OTCPK:SHCAY), HP (NYSE:HPQ), Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), Acer, Samsung, Motorola, Google, Nokia, Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI), Epson (OTCPK:SEKEY), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and many, many more. Take a look at the company's most recent fact sheet released in May of this year.As early as 2009 - 2010, they had recognized there would be a slowdown in high-end devices especially in China. By forming new partnership agreements with tier 1, tier 2 and white box manufacturers, Himax was able to grow into the slump. 2009 is important in many ways: Innolux, the world's third largest panel manufacturer, owns 15% of Himax. In 2009, Himax was extremely dependent on Innolux with 68% of revenues coming from that single customer. Take a look at the table below."
A Value Investor's Dream: Chemed Corporation,Nov. 5.13,"Chemed Corporation (NYSE:CHE) is the parent company of two subsidies: 1) Roto-Rooter and 2) VITAS. Roto-Rooter operates through 110 company-owned branches and independent contractors, and over 400 franchisees. VITAS focuses on curative hospice care that helps make terminally ill patients' final days as comfortable and pain free as possible. The question is: how can the parent's management be effective operating in two distinct industries?One thing is certain though: Chemed Corporation isn't the next Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B). Similar to Berkshire though, the company is a cash generating machine, posting $17.4m, $14.6m, $22.2m, and $26.7m in net income, the past four quarters, on a US GAAP basis. On an Adjusted EBITDA basis the company made $201.4m in 2012, $197.3m in 2011, and $189.4m in 2010. And, as the years have passed (no pun intended), management has decided to repurchase the company's shares.The number of shares outstanding since 2010 has steadily been decreasing as the Board of Directors has announced share buybacks of $70m in 2010, $100m in February 2011, $100m on November 2011, and more recently another $100m in February 2013. The share count as of December 31, 2012 was 19.3 million. The Chemed share buyback program almost seems like that of some tobacco companies; given enough years, there'll be no more shares to buy back!As a market participant I know from past market activity if an activist investor wants to split up a company, the activist will start with purchasing common shares. Chemed is low hanging fruit so to speak for an activist, and with such a low share count, volume activity will be noticeable and the common shares will rise.Caution AheadCash generator, share buy backs, shareholder friendly...is Chemed Corporation to good too be true? As a deep value investor, I enjoy a good scandal at a company as it provides a great opportunity to buy shares cheaply. Upon further research, VITAS, the hospice care subsidy, has faced allegations of committing fraud by falsifying the acute care diagnosis of patients, which has led to improper reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid. Lying to the federal government is obviously a serious offense and has its downside. But since these allegations have surfaced in early 2005 and more recently May 2013, I would be hard-pressed to think management or the BOD have no controls in place to mitigate the risks of improper billings and/or improper patient diagnoses, given the allegation are eight years old."
Intel: What About McAfee?,Aug. 6.13,"Back in August 2010, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) bought McAfee software for $7.6 billion. The company has been taking heavy duty ""steam"" from analysts and shareholders ever since. On the day of the purchase, the stock sold off by 3.5%, hardly a vote of confidence for Paul Otellini and the Intel board of directors who voted for the deal.Being a hardware guy, utterly fascinated by the fact that Intel can repeatably make widgets whose dimensions are measured in billionths of a meter, I really didn't know or care what they intended to do with McAfee. I just assumed that a group of people who could do the magic of making extremely complex integrated circuits containing billions of transistors must have a good reason for buying a software company.Now, this is back in the day when the Sandy Bridge was the new thing on the block, made on the new 32nm process. We hadn't heard about 22nm yet, and certainly not the 22nm Trigate process that was soon to come. Those in the know understood that the linking of Intel processors and McAfee's software more closely could finally thwart those warped people who write malware that infects your computer through the Internet. In the world I would design, those who purposely infect your computers with viruses and employ phishing technology to steal your identity would be committing a capital crime with commensurate sanctions should they get caught.Intel, with the McAfee purchase, promised to end all this forever. The anti-virus software available is so bad and slows computers so badly that it is not much better than a virus itself. The Intel solution talked about doing the antivirus work in the processor itself. This would make the antivirus magic so fast as to be undetectable to the average computer user like me. Intel promised zero day protection, and got even more steam from the software people for presuming to do such a thing.We are three years out from that huge acquisition. Sandy Bridge has come and gone. Ivy Bridge (Sandy Bridge on 22nm) has come and gone. Even Otellini is gone! We now have Haswell, the first processor with the hardware hooks that will allow the security promise to become reality. In the middle of May 2013, McAfee introduced LiveSafe, a cross platform universal security package:"
Uni-Pixel: UniBoss Looking To Be Another Failure For The Company,Jul. 2.13,"Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) has been one of the more volatile stocks during the fast half of 2013, having traded as high as $41 just around two months ago before crashing down over 60% to the current price range of $14-$15. However, many of my colleagues and I still see significant downside and risks ahead for the company. We feel the stock rose on nothing but hype from over-promotion of the stock and over-bullish statements from the company's management and longs which do not truly reflect the business fundamentals. Even at the current prices the stock is still drastically overvalued and has much further room to fall since UniBoss may not be a viable product for commercial production. There are signs that history may repeat itself and UniBoss will just be another failure like past Uni-Pixel products.Uni-Pixel - A History of FailuresWe feel investors should take a closer look at the company's past and see why the company and its management should definitely not be given the benefit of the doubt. Nor should investors put much faith in any current claims made by the company.Uni-Pixel initially became publicly traded on the OTC board through a reverse merger with a company called Real-estateforlease.com in 2006. The documents for the merger plan can be found here. Uni-Pixel itself had nothing to do with the online real estate business. Real-estateforlease.com has long been a defunct company ever since 2002 with no operations and assets. It was a just a shell company trading over the counter. The reverse merger was solely done so Uni-Pixel can become publicly traded and later move to the Nasdaq in 2010.The reverse merger is the same backdoor technique used by many of the fraudulent Chinese stocks to go public in the US. This is due to the fact that they cannot become public through a traditional IPO. A simple due diligence from the investment banks during the IPO process would have shown their operations to be fraudulent and/or highly questionable. Therefore they use the reverse merger technique which requires no scrutiny from any outside parties to become public and then later they can sell shares through secondaries to con money from US investors."
Oracle: A Great Long-Term Stock Investment For Patient Investors,Oct.25.13,"Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) is still the world's largest seller of enterprise software. It has more than 400,000 big and small corporate clients across 140 countries. It has a solid history of annual growth for the last three decades. The company is the undisputed leader in providing corporate database management to the biggest corporations in the world.The company's recent diversification toward cloud-based and hardware-based services has dampened investors' enthusiasm for it. Oracle's move toward creating revenue streams outside its proven core Software as a Service expertise is seen as a high-risk act by many. Based on recent analysts' stock reports, majority of them rated Oracle as not a good ""short-term investment.""Risk AssessmentOracle itself admitted in its annual report that it is vulnerable to several risk factors. As per the annual PDF report, ""Our limited experience with managing our hardware business and forecasting its future financial results creates additional challenges with our forecasting processes."" Oracle's management warns its investors that, at the moment, the company is open to uncontrollable risks as it expands its business. New competitors, unforeseen technology innovations and international government actions offer unpredictable threats to the profitability of Oracle.Due to this confession of the company's exposure to new risks, analysts are predicting a poor stock performance for Oracle for this year. Some of them even strongly advised a sell order for Oracle shares as soon as possible to minimize short-term losses.Short-Term EffectDue to the high-risk valuation for Oracle, several of its key stock investors have recently dumped their shares. Even company insiders have sold a substantial part of their Oracle share holdings - farther worsening the gloomy outlook of the company. For the last 30 days, several Oracle employees have dumped more than 525,000 shares in the market. For 2013, more than 5.2 million shares held by company insiders have been sold. And since January no Oracle employee has bought any share of the company."
"If You Are An Apple Lover, You Shouldn't Miss Corning",Sep.16.13,"Gorilla glass panels, revolutionary display glass panels, have seen demand growth due the boom in smartphone and tablet sales. As the name suggests, this glass is durable and provides scratch resistance features. Since its launch by Corning (GLW) in 2007, major smartphone and tablet manufacturers have used this glass as the display panel. To maintain its growth streak, the company is attempting to expand from smartphones and tablets to touch notebooks and markerboards.Gorilla is out of the cage! Can it continue its bull run?Source: Company websiteCorning, a world leader in specialty glass, launched Gorilla Glass NBT for touch enabled Notebooks on July 29, 2013. This type of glass provides 10 times more scratch resistance than glass previously used in devices. With annual sales surpassing $1 billion last year, this glass has been used by every major device manufacturer including Apple (AAPL), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), HTC, etc.To continue its growth in device display glass, the company has entered the touch notebook market. These panels are expected to cost as low as 2% of the notebooks retail price, therefore manufacturers can use these glass panels without a major change in their cost. Dell is the first computer manufacturer to adopt this new glass in their upcoming touch notebook, and due to its cost effective advantages, more notebook manufacturers are expected to follow suit.The touch notebook market is an emerging market with sales estimated to be around 10%-15% of the 188 million laptop sales in 2013, as per IDC. Therefore, at an estimation of 15%, 28 million touch notebooks will be shipped this year.At an average price of $750 for each touch notebook, this glass panel will cost $15 per unit. Gorilla glass had achieved 20% cell phone market share from 2007-2010. Assuming that total touch enabled sales remain constant in the next year, then 20% market share new Gorilla glass NBT is expected to achieve revenue of $85 million in 2014. Gorilla glass has been adopted in 1.5 billion devices, and with adoption in touch notebooks, this figure is expected to rise."
"Samsung And Microsoft Have Winning Strategies, Apple Has Some Strategic Decisions To Make","Nov. 25, 2013 7:20 AM ET","The hot spots for growth in smart connected devices are smartphones and tablets. No surprise there.Geographically, the bulk of the growth will take place in emerging markets, and in particular in China and India. No surprise there, again.The theory of the case for a while has been that the opportunity for smartphone suppliers has been to convert feature phone users to smartphones and in particular for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) now that it has purchased the handset business of Nokia with its massive worldwide share of feature phones. Microsoft has placed a lot of emphasis on Europe and emerging markets for its Lumia line of Windows OS smartphones, the latest of which were launched in Abu Dhabi rather than New York. Lumias have so far enjoyed only limited success in North America. At the same time, smartphone suppliers including Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), Micromax and Nokia (NYSE:NOK) have included a tablet or hybrid offering in their portfolio, and with the emergence of ""phablets"" the lines between these devices have become blurred.One can summarize the implicit strategies of each of the major smartphone platforms in a few lines.
